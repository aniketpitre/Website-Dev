Why should I add Workato's IP addresses to my allowlist?

Adding [Workato's IP addresses](/en/security/ip-allowlists#traffic-from-workato) to your allowlist enhances connection security by helping prevent traffic hijacking to and from Workato by malicious websites.

How can I configure my database to allowlist Workato's IP addresses?

You can [use SQL commands](/en/security/ip-allowlists#example-allowlist-configuration) to allowlist Workato's IP addresses in your database. Run the following SQL command on your database to allowlist the Workato IP addresses:

```sql
GRANT ALL ON db1.*
TO 'integrationuser'@'52.5.142.59',
'integrationuser'@'34.226.132.221',
'integrationuser'@'52.54.43.157';
```

What should I consider when adding IP addresses to the allowlist for OPA version 2.11.0 or newer?

For [OPA version 2.11.0 or later](/en/security/ip-allowlists#on-premise-gateway-addresses), you must add specific FQDNs and IP addresses to the allowlist. It's important to use both the sg3 and sg4 versions for load balancing.

How do I configure firewall allowlists for on-premise gateway IP addresses?

To [configure firewall allowlists](/en/security/ip-allowlists#static-assets) for on-premise gateway IP addresses, you must enable outbound TCP connections from the OPA to port 443.

What should I do if my organization restricts DNS resolutions for the OPA?

Ensure that the machine where OPA runs can resolve the IP addresses of the on-premise gateway's FQDNs if your organization [restricts DNS resolutions](/en/security/ip-allowlists#dns-resolution-of-fqdns).
