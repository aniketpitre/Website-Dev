This guide explains how to use secrets from your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Secrets Manager vault to configure Workato connections.

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you must have the following prerequisites:

- **In Workato**:
  
  - A successful AWS Secrets Manager [workspace-level](/en/security/data-protection/secrets-management/setting-up-workspace-level-aws-secrets-manager) or [project-level](/en/security/data-protection/secrets-management/setting-up-project-level-aws-secrets-manager) connection.
  - A [user role](/en/roles) with **Create** and **Edit Connections** privileges.
- **In Amazon Web Services (AWS)**:
  
  - An existing secret in **JSON key/value pair** format. Workato doesn't support plaintext secrets. Refer to the AWS documentation for more information on how to [create a secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create_secret.html).
  - Permissions that allow you to view secrets in AWS Secrets Manager.

## Retrieve the secret's details from AWS

Complete the following steps to retrieve the secret's details from AWS:

1. Sign in to your AWS Management Console and open the [Secrets Manager console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager).
   
2. In the navigation pane, click **Secrets**.
   
3. Click the secret you plan to use in Workato.
   
4. Copy and store the **Secret name** and **Secret ARN** securely. These values are required to configure the external secret in Workato.

## Configure a Workato connection

Complete the following steps to configure a connection in Workato using AWS Secrets Manager:

1. Create a new connection or open the configuration page for an existing connection in your Workato account.
   
2. Click or hover over the input field that requires an external secret, then click **\+ Add external secret**.
   
3. Enter the **Key name** and **Secret ARN** in the **Add external secret** dialog.

4. Click **Done**. The secret appears as a masked datapill in the input field on the connection page.
   
   Select the datapill to edit the secret.
   
5. Click **Connect** and verify that this connection works.
   

If you prefer to add the secret with a secret mask, follow this syntax for the secrets used in Workato connection credentials:

```txt
{{workato:sm:<key name>:<secret ARN>}}
```

  

- `<key name>`
  
- Refers to the specific key name within a secret, not the secret name itself. For example, in a secret named `jira`, there may be a key/value pair where `prod.jira.secret.key` is the key name, and its value is the actual personal access token.
  
- `<secret ARN>`
  
- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the secret in AWS Secrets Manager. For example:
  
  ```txt
  {{workato:sm:prod.jira.secret.key:arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:137149879143:secret:prod-jira-credentials-FsmeTs}}
  ```
  

In this example, `prod.jira.secret.key` is the key name in a secret named `jira`, and `arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:137149879143:secret:prod-jira-credentials-FsmeTs` is the `secret ARN`.

In the connection's configuration page, paste this entire value into the appropriate field. The following image shows a secret being used as the **Custom Service client secret** value in a Jira connection:

## Complete your connection setup

Select **Connect** to authorize and complete your connection setup.

## Secrets cache behavior

Workato caches credentials retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager for **60 minutes**. During this period, recipes continue to use the cached value, even if you update or rotate the secret.

After the cache expires, the next recipe execution retrieves the latest value from AWS Secrets Manager. You can call the [Clear secrets management cache](/en/workato-api/environment-management#clear-secrets-management-cache) endpoint to apply changes immediately. This forces Workato to fetch the latest credentials without requiring you to disconnect and reconnect the connection.
