# Set up Google Secret Manager for a project

This guide explains how to set up Google Secret Manager at the project level in Workato.

> **SWITCHING SCOPES**
> 
> Existing workspace-level secret references in this project stop working when you switch to project-level secrets management. You must reconfigure these references to use project-level secrets.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following before you begin:

- **In Workato**:
  
  - The **Create/Edit connections** privilege in the target project.
- **In Google Cloud**:
  
  - **Active GCP project**: You need an active Google Cloud project with billing enabled.
  - **Secret Manager setup**: You should have secrets already created in Secret Manager. Create them before configuring the connection if they don't exist.
  - **Service account**: You need a service account with the following roles assigned:
    - **Secret Manager Secret Accessor** (`roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`)
    - **Secret Manager Viewer** (`roles/secretmanager.viewer`)
  - **Service account key**: You need the JSON key file for the service account.

Refer to [Set up a Google Cloud service account](/en/security/data-protection/secrets-management/google-service-account-setup) if you haven't created a service account.

## Enable project-level secrets management

Complete the following steps to enable project-level secrets management in workspace admin:

1. Sign in to Workato.
   
2. Go to **Workspace admin > Settings > External secrets manager**.
   
3. Enable the **Use external secrets manager** toggle.
   
4. Use the **Scope** drop-down menu to select **Set up secrets management for each project individually**.

5. Click **Save**.
   

> **ABOUT SCOPES**
> 
> You can configure Google Secret Manager at the workspace level or the project level. The selected scope determines how secrets apply across projects:
> 
> - **Workspace level**: All projects inherit the workspace secrets manager configuration. This centralizes management but applies the same Secret Manager connection across all projects.
> - **Project level**: Each project uses its own secrets manager configuration, independent of other projects or workspace settings. This provides flexibility but requires per-project setup.

## Enable Google Secret Manager for the project

Complete the following steps to enable Google Secret Manager for your project:

1. Select the project where you plan to configure Google Secret Manager.
   
2. Go to **Settings > Secrets management**.
   
3. Enable the **Use external secrets manager** toggle.
   
4. Use the **Which secrets manager do you want to use?** drop-down menu to select **Google Secret Manager**.
   
5. Click **Set up connection**.
   

## Connect to Google Secret Manager

Complete the following steps to configure the connection between Workato and your Google Cloud project's Secret Manager:

1. Enter a name for this connection in the **Connection name** field.
   
   ![Connect to Google Secret Manager](/assets/connect.B53id9Sv.png)_Connect to Google Secret Manager_
   
2. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project or folder where you plan to store this connection.
   
3. Use the **Connection type** drop-down menu to specify whether this is a cloud or on-prem connection.
   
4. Enter the ID of your project in Google Cloud in the **Project ID** field. You can find this in the GCP Console project selector or project dashboard.
   
5. Enter the service account email in the **Client email** field. The service account must have the **Secret Manager Secret Accessor** (`roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`) and **Secret Manager Viewer** (`roles/secretmanager.viewer`) roles assigned.
   
6. Provide the **Private key** from your service account JSON key file.
   
   Retrieve your private key
   
   1. Open the JSON key file you downloaded when creating the service account.
      
   2. Locate the `private_key` field in the JSON file.
      
   3. Copy the entire private key value (including the `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----` markers).
      
   4. Paste it into the **Private key** field.
      
   
7. Click **Connect**.
   

> **CONNECTION VALIDATION**
> 
> Check the following if the connection fails:
> 
> - Confirm the **Project ID** field contains the project ID, not the project number
> - Confirm the client email matches the service account email in Google Cloud
> - Confirm the private key contains no extra spaces or missing characters
> - Confirm the service account has the **Secret Manager Secret Accessor** (`roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`) and **Secret Manager Viewer** (`roles/secretmanager.viewer`) roles
> - Confirm the Secret Manager API is enabled in the Google Cloud project
