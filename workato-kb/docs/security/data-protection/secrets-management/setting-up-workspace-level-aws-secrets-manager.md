> Set up AWS Secrets Manager at the workspace level to manage connection credentials for your Workato account from one secrets manager.

# Set up AWS Secrets Manager for workspaces

This guide explains how to configure secrets management for your Workato account at the workspace level using AWS Secrets Manager.

> **WARNING**
> 
> Switching to workspace-specific secrets management causes all previously-configured external secret references to stop working.
> 
> Ensure that the IAM role in Workato provides access using the workspace-level external ID, so all secrets currently in use continue working.

After your AWS Secrets Manager successfully connects to Workato, you can start using [secrets when configuring connections](/en/security/data-protection/secrets-management/using-aws-secrets-in-connections).

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you must have the following:

- Permissions that allow you to create and modify IAM permissions policies
- Permissions that allow you to create and modify IAM roles

## Select the scope for secrets management

1. Sign in to Workato.
   
2. Go to **Workspace admin > Settings > External secrets manager**.
   
3. Click the **Use external secrets manager** toggle.
   
4. Select the **Set up secrets for the entire workspace** option from the **Scope** drop-down menu.

   - Add the role to your Workato account

## Select the AWS Account ID and external ID

1. In the **Create a new permission policy and role in AWS** guide detail, Workato displays the IAM details. Note them to use in the following steps:
   
   - AWS Account ID
   - Copy the **AWS Account ID** for use in the ongoing secrets manager configuration.
   - External ID
   - Copy the **External ID** for use in the ongoing secrets manager configuration. The value should be in the format `workato_iam_external_id_wwwww`, where `wwwww` is the ID of the workspace.

## Create IAM role and ARN retrieval

Refer to the [IAM role-based authentication for AWS](/en/security/data-protection/secrets-management/iam-role-based-authentication-for-aws) page for instructions on how to create an IAM role for Workato, create an IAM permissions policy, and retrieve your Amazon resource name (ARN).
