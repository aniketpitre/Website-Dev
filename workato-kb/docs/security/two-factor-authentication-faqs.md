- Authy
- Microsoft Authenticator

How do I get a new recovery code?

[Recovery codes](/en/security/two-factor-authentication#recovery-codes) are alphanumeric strings unique to your Workato account. They can be used to verify your identity in place of the 6-digit verification code. Each recovery code can be used only once. Store them securely.
