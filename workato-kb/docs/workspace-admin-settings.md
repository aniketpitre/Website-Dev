# Workspace admin settings

Workspace admin settings provide workspace-wide configuration and management options. These settings affect all collaborators in your workspace and typically require admin privileges to access and modify.

You can access workspace admin settings by going to **Workspace admin > Settings**.

> **DISPLAYED FEATURES VARY**
> 
> Available features vary depending on your platform plan and privilege levels determined by [role-based access control](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/#how-role-based-access-control-works).

## Workspace

Configure general workspace information and features.

### General

View and edit your workspace name, email, ID, session settings, logo, and community profile.

#### Workspace info

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace name | A name for your workspace that identifies it across Workato. |
| Workspace email | The designated email address for your workspace. **Note:** AHQ child workspaces and Embedded customer workspaces don't have an account owner, so the **Workspace email** field doesn't appear in this section. |
| Workspace ID | A unique identifier for your workspace. This may be referenced as **User ID** in recipes. |
| Session timeout duration | The time of inactivity after which users are logged out. |
| Active Job Execution Time Unit | The unit of time (for example, minutes or hours) for measuring active job execution time quotas. |
| Active Job Execution Time Limit | The maximum amount of time a job can spend actively running actions. Waiting or idle periods (for example, during scheduled stops) don't count toward this quota. The default is 90 minutes. |
| Workspace logo | A logo that represents your workspace across Workato. **Note:** If a workspace logo is missing and a profile logo exists, the profile logo displays on this screen. |

#### Community profile

Manage your workspace's public profile settings, which include name, contact email, website, and logo. You can also configure whether recipes can be published in the community library.

View an overview of your workspace's subscription plan and usage metrics across all environments. This page displays information about your current plan, including recipe and task quotas, active add-ons, and renewal date. You can also monitor recipe and task usage with graphs that break down consumption by environment.

If you don't see this tab in your workspace admin settings, you can view [billing and usage details](/en/pricing/usage) by selecting **Usage** in the sidebar. Refer to the [Pricing](/en/pricing) documentation for more information.
