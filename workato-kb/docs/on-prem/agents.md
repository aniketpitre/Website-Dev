# On-prem agent

The Workato on-prem agent provides a secure way for Workato to selectively access customer-authorized on-prem apps, databases, and folders without having to open ports in the corporate firewall.

Users can communicate securely with Workato by installing the agent within the protected server.

The on-prem agent is used to create connections that are used by recipes to perform requests. These on-prem connections can be connected to one or more agents in an [on-prem group](/en/on-prem/groups).

> **USE MULTIPLE AGENTS**
> 
> On-prem groups distribute their workload evenly across all contained agents. Workato recommends adding multiple agents to an on-prem group to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and load balancing. You can further enhance these capabilities by hosting some of the group's agents on a separate server.
