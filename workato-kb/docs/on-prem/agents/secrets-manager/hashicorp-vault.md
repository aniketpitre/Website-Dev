# Configuring HashiCorp Vault for on-prem agent

On-prem agent [v2.19](/en/on-prem/agents/versions) and later supports using [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault) as a secrets engine for [cloud profiles](/en/on-prem/agents/connection/cloud).

To set up HashiCorp Vault for OPA, follow either of the guides below. However, when you get to **Step 3**, select an on-prem group from the **Connection type** picklist instead of _Cloud_. The rest of the setup is identical.

- [Setting up HashiCorp Vault secrets engines for projects](/en/security/data-protection/secrets-management/setting-up-project-level-hashicorp-vault-secrets-engine)

When you configure HashiCorp Vault for cloud profiles, you do not need to manually edit the `config.yml` file.
