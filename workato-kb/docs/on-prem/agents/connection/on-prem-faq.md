## On-prem agent connections

What is the role of an on-prem agent connection in Workato, and how does it determine where requests originate?

A [connection in Workato](/en/on-prem/agents/connection#connections-using-on-prem-agent) determines the source from which requests are executed. Direct connection requests originate from Workato servers. Connections using an on-prem agent send requests from the environment where the agent is installed.

How can I set up a connection for an on-prem agent?

You can set up a connection for an on-prem agent using two methods: Cloud profile and Connection profile. [Cloud profiles](/en/on-prem/agents/connection/cloud) allow you to configure a connection directly within Workato. [Connection profiles](/en/on-prem/agents/connection/profile) require manual configuration in the on-prem agent's config file.

How does a cloud profile simplify connection setup for on-prem agents?

A [cloud profile](/en/on-prem/agents/connection#cloud-profile) lets you set up a connection directly in Workato, similar to regular connectors. This eliminates the need to manually open and edit the config file of the on-prem agent which is required with connection profiles.

Can I connect to a database using a cloud profile or a connection profile for an on-prem agent?

Yes, all database connectors offer the option to connect through an on-prem agent using a cloud profile or a connection profile.

[Cloud profile](/en/on-prem/agents/connection#cloud-profile): You must select the on-prem group you plan to use in the connection field.

[Connection profile](/en/on-prem/agents/connection#connection-profile): You must select the on-prem group you plan to use in the connection field. Enter the on-prem connection profile name and verify that it matches the configuration in the `config.yml` file of the on-prem agent.

How can I connect to an on-prem file system?

You can [connect to an on-prem file system](/en/on-prem/agents/connection#connecting-to-on-prem-file-system-profiles-using-connection-profile) with a cloud profile or connection profile:

**Cloud profile**: You must use an on-prem agent to connect to an on-prem file system. You must select the relevant on-prem group in the connection fields and provide the necessary properties for the on-prem file system.

**Connection profile**: You must select the relevant on-prem group and enter the on-prem connection profile name. This name must match the configuration in the **files** section of the `config.yml` file of the on-prem agent.

What is a connection profile, and how does it differ from a cloud profile?

A [connection profile](/en/on-prem/agents/connection#connection-profile) requires you to manually fill in the connection details in the configuration file of the on-prem agent. Cloud profiles provide direct setup in Workato.

Why am I receiving a Snowflake JDBC driver internal error?

Error:

```
JDBC driver internal error: exception creating result java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError at net.snowflake.client.jdbc.internal.apache.arrow.memory.ArrowBuf.getDirectBuffer(ArrowBuf.java:231).: XX000
```

If you receive the preceding [Snowflake](/en/connectors/snowflake#snowflake) error when you execute a select query while using a custom SQL action, you can resolve it using one of the following methods:

- Add `&JDBC_QUERY_RESULT_FORMAT=JSON` to the connection URL (recommended)
- Use an older Snowflake JDBC driver version, for example 3.9.2

Why am I encountering a JDBC Connection error to Databricks?

Error:

```
java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError: Exception java.lang.RuntimeException: Failed to initialize MemoryUtil. [in thread "pool-21-thread-1"]
```

This error may occur due to the driver's use of Apache Arrow for data transfer. To resolve this error, disable Apache Arrow by adding `EnableArrow=0` to your JDBC URL:

```
jdbc:spark://host.cloud.databricks.com:443/default;EnableArrow=0;
```

This parameter change bypasses the initialization error and allows for a successful connection.

## On-prem cloud connections

What's a cloud profile in Workato?

A [cloud profile](/en/on-prem/agents/connection/cloud#cloud-profiles) is a new way of configuring connections for on-prem agents (OPA) in Workato, introduced in OPA version 2.15.0. It allows you to set up on-prem connections directly within the Workato platform, eliminating the need to edit the local on-prem agent configuration file.

What types of systems can I connect to using cloud profiles?

- Apache Kafka
- Active Directory
- Command-line scripts

How do I apply a new configuration using cloud profiles?

When you [create a new connection](/en/on-prem/agents/connection/cloud#applying-a-new-configuration) using a cloud profile, the details are automatically propagated to all agents within the specific on-prem group. This process usually happens almost immediately, but in some cases it might take more time for an agent to receive updated connection details.

What are the properties of a database cloud connection profile?

How do I apply a new connection profile configuration?

Your OPA must be restarted whenever a change is made to `config.yml`, including when you [apply a new connection profile](/en/on-prem/agents/connection/profile#applying-a-new-configuration). To allow the on-prem agent to apply the changes automatically, add `config: autoReload: true` to the top of your `config.yml` file. When enabled, changes made to `config.yml` are picked up by `autoReload`, and no manual restart is required. Note that `autoReload` doesn't apply to changes made to server profiles, which require you to manually start and stop the OPA.

What are database connection profiles used for?

[Database connection profiles](/en/on-prem/agents/connection/profile#database-profile) provide the information your OPA uses to connect to a database. These profiles are located in the database section of the `config.yml` file. OPA supports connections to multiple databases.
