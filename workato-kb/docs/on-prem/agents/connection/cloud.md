> Set up on-prem agent connections directly in Workato with cloud profiles, without editing a config file on the agent's machine.

# Cloud Profiles

A single Workato on-prem agent (OPA) can connect to multiple on-prem applications. A **cloud profile** allows you to set up a connection directly in Workato. This option can be selected when [creating a new on-prem group](/en/on-prem/groups/create-group).

> **SUMMARY**
> 
> - Cloud profiles let you configure on-prem connections directly in Workato, rather than manually editing a local config file on the agent's system.
> - Cloud profiles support databases, on-prem file systems, SAP, Apache Kafka, certain secrets management systems, and other systems.
> - OPA versions starting from `2.15.0` support cloud profiles.
> - When you create a new connection, Workato automatically propagates the configuration details to all agents in the on-prem group.

### What's a cloud profile?

A cloud profile is a new way of setting connection for on-prem agent. Since OPA version `2.15.0` you can configure on-prem connections directly in Workato instead of editing local on-prem agent config file. This is a big simplification of the existing process as you no longer need a direct access to the machine where the agent is installed. Just make sure your agent is up and running.

When creating a connection you will see the input field called `Connection type`. It is a list of existing on-prem groups. For some of the cloud connectors there can be a default `Cloud` setting. Make sure you select on-prem group that supports cloud profiles so you can create a connection directly in Workato.

Below is an example of SQL Server connection when on-prem group with cloud profiles is selected. As you can see database connection properties can be set just like for a normal cloud connector.

![SQL Server cloud profile connection](/assets/on-prem-agent-cloud-profile-example.BQZ8QmfO.png)_SQL Server cloud profile connection_

### What types of systems can I connect to?

Cloud profiles are supported by the following system types:

- [Databases](#database-profile)
- [On-prem file systems](#on-prem-files-profile)
- [SAP](#sap-profile)
- [Java messaging service](#jms-profile)
- [Apache Kafka](#apache-kafka-profile)
- [Active Directory](#active-directory-profile)
- [Command-line scripts](#command-line-scripts-profile)

> **WARNING**
> 
> Please note that configuring some additional settings like google secrets manager, azure key vault or more advanced settings is not yet supported by cloud profiles. If you want to use them please check [connection profiles](/en/on-prem/agents/connection/profile).

### How do I apply a new configuration?

When you create a new connection the details are automatically propagated to all agents in the specific on-prem group. It should happen almost immediately but in some cases it might take a while for an agent to get updated connection details.

## Database cloud profiles

Database cloud profiles provide the information your on-prem agent (OPA) uses to connect to a database.

> **JDBC DRIVER REQUIREMENT**
> 
> To establish a connection with a JDBC database, copy the appropriate JDBC driver to the `lib_ext` folder of your on-prem agent. The on-prem agent can't connect to the database without this driver.

All database connectors allow you to connect through an on-prem agent. In the connection fields, choose the on-prem group from the **Connection type** field.

After [creating an on-prem group](/en/on-prem/groups/create-group) that supports cloud profile configuration, you can configure the connection in Workato as a cloud connector. Fill in the required fields and click **Connect**.

![Database connection using cloud profiles](/assets/on-prem-agent-db-cloud.DxhDh-9a.png)_Database connection using cloud profile_

In this section, we'll cover:

- [Profile properties](#profile-properties)
- [Supported database types](#supported-databases)

### Profile Properties

Database cloud connection profiles can contain the following properties:

| Property name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **url/host** _required_ | The host address of the database. For example, `localhost`. **Note:** A `url` or `host` value must be provided to fully configure the connection profile. |
| **port** _conditional_ | The port of the database. This property may be omitted if using the default port for a database type. For example, PostgreSQL databases use port `5432` by default. If your PostgreSQL uses this port, you don't need to add a `port` property to the connection profile. Default ports are listed in the [Supported databases](#supported-databases) section. |
| **database** _conditional_ | The name of the database. For example: `sales` **Note:** This property may be omitted if the `url` property is provided. |
| **username** _required_ | The username of a database user that will be used to connect to the database. |
| **password** _required_ | The password of the database user (`username`). |
| **ssl** _optional_ | Options for configuring SSL connections. SSL is supported for the following databases: **MySQL**: version 5.7 and higher, **PostgreSQL**: version 11.x and higher Contains the following properties: **Server certificate** (optional): X509 server certification in .pem format., **SSL certificate** (optional): X509 client certificate in .pem format., **SSL certificate key** (optional): RSA client key in .pem format. |

### Supported Databases

The following table contains information about the databases OPA currently supports.

| Database name | Default port |
| --- | --- |
| Amazon Redshift | `5439` |
| JDBC-compatible databases | N/A |
| Microsoft SQL Server | `1433` |
| MySQL | `3306` |
| Oracle | `1521` |
| PostgreSQL | `5432` |

* * *

## FTP(S) Cloud Profile

Refer to the [FTP connector documentation](/en/connectors/ftp).

* * *

> **ON-PREM AGENT VERSION**
> 
> OPA 25.0 or newer is required to use the FTP(S) connector.

## SFTP Cloud Profile

Refer to the [SFTP connector documentation](/en/connectors/sftp).

* * *

> **ON-PREM AGENT VERSION**
> 
> OPA 24.0 or newer is required to use the SFTP connector.

## SMB Cloud Profile

Refer to the [SMB connector documentation](/en/connectors/smb) for additional information.

* * *

> **ON-PREM AGENT VERSION**
> 
> OPA 26.0 or newer is required to use the SMB connector.

## SAP Cloud Profile

There are two connection types that the SAP connector supports - [Direct connections](#sap-direct-connection) or [Message Server connections](#sap-message-server-connection).

> **SAP DEFAULT PORTS**
> 
> The SAP connector uses the following ports by default:
> 
> - **With SAP Message Server**: `36xx`, where `xx` is the SAP system number.
> - **Without SAP Message Server** (such as a direct call to SAP): `48xx` with SNC, or `33xx` without SNC.
> 
> For HTTP(S) inbound communication, such as consuming REST OData services and SOAP web services provisioned from SAP, ports default to `8000` for HTTP and `44300` for HTTPS. Complete the following steps to find the ports to use for a custom SAP configuration:
> 
> 1. Go to the ICM Monitor **(SMICM)** transaction.
>    
> 2. Select **Goto > Services** to display the services configured in ICM and their corresponding ports.
>    

If the ports vary from our defaults, ensure port overrides are included in the connection details using the optional inputs for 'Client MS Server' and 'MS Server'.

> **IDOC RECEPTION STRATEGY**
> 
> Effective on-prem agent (OPA) v32.2, you can set the IDoc reception strategy using the **IDoc reception strategy** connection property. Supported values are:
> 
> - `LEGACY`: Default. Retained for backward compatibility. No configuration change is required to keep the existing behavior, because OPA uses `LEGACY` by default.
> - `SAPIDOC`: Recommended. Supports multi-byte characters. Non-unicode systems must select `SAPIDOC` after upgrading OPA to version 32.2.
> 
> Ensure that all connections pointing to the same on-prem group maintain consistent values for this property.

### SAP - Direct Connection

## JMS Cloud Profile

The following JMS providers are supported by the cloud profile on-prem agent:

- Amazon Simple Queue Service
- Apache ActiveMQ
- Azure Service Bus

### Amazon SQS

You need the following configuration properties when connecting to Amazon SQS:

![On-prem cloud profile amazon](/assets/on-prem-jms-amazon.0INO6hRH.png)_On-prem cloud profile amazon_

| Property name | Comment |
| --- | --- |
| region | Your Amazon API region, eg 'us-east-2' |
| accessKey | Your Amazon API access key |
| secretKey | Your Amazon API secret |

Ensure your SQS queue exists before sending messages.

### Apache ActiveMQ

For connecting to a running ActiveMQ broker you only need to specify the broker URL:

![On-prem cloud profile activemq](/assets/on-prem-jms-activemq.CqEk9UWH.png)_On-prem cloud profile activemq_

The ActiveMQ broker can't be embedded in the agent. OPA doesn't support `vm://` broker connections.

### Azure Service Bus

Azure Service Bus uses a custom JMS provider. Use the following configuration properties to connect, replacing `<HOST_NAME>`, `<POLICY_NAME>`, and `<PRIMARY_KEY>` with values from Azure Service Bus:

```yaml
jms:
  azureServiceBus:
    provider: custom
    class: org.apache.qpid.jms.JmsConnectionFactory
    remoteURI: amqps://<HOST_NAME>.servicebus.windows.net
    username: <POLICY_NAME>
    password: "<PRIMARY_KEY>"
```

Download the required [JAR files and dependencies](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.qpid/qpid-jms-client) and place them in your `lib_ext` folder.

Add the classpath inside the `config.yml` file.

```yaml
server:
  classpath: lib_ext
```
