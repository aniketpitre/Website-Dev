> Reference for Workato on-prem agent version deprecation and sunset dates, with the upgrade schedule to avoid recipe disruptions.

# On-prem agent version deprecation

Workato regularly releases new versions of the on-prem agent (OPA). Workato deprecates older OPA versions on a recurring schedule to ensure users benefit from these improvements.

Upgrading the OPA provides the following benefits:

- **Security:** Newer versions include enhanced security.
- **Performance:** Newer versions are better optimized for speed and reliability.
- **New features:** Newer versions support the latest Workato platform features, including new connectors, updated triggers and actions, and additional configuration options.

Refer to the [OPA version notes](/en/on-prem/agents/versions) for information about recent OPA changes.

> **UPGRADE THE OPA**
> 
> Workato recommends that you [upgrade the OPA](/en/on-prem/agents/upgrade) regularly to keep the version no more than one year old.

## Deprecation schedule

The following schedule lists the deprecation and sunset dates of the Workato on-prem agents. Contact your Workato Customer Success Manager if you have additional questions about OPA deprecation.

- After the **Deprecation date**, the OPA continues to run, but Workato no longer provides support.
  
- On the **Sunset date**, the OPA stops connecting to Workato, which disrupts all running recipes. Upgrade the OPA before the sunset date to avoid interruptions.
