# Connections using an on-prem agent

A [connection](/en/connections) determines where requests will be made from. With a direct connection, requests will be executed from Workato servers. A connection using an on-prem agent will have requests sent from the environment where the agent is installed in.

> **SUMMARY**
> 
> - An on-prem agent lets you securely send Workato requests from the private environment where the agent is installed.
> - There are two types of on-prem connections: cloud profiles and connection profiles. Connector triggers and actions are the same for either type.
> - Cloud profiles are set up directly in Workato, so you don't need to access the machine where the on-prem agent is installed.
> - Connection profiles are set up manually in a `config.yml` file on the machine where the on-prem agent is installed.

For some of your connections, you may want to specify whether it connects through Workato servers or through your on-prem agent. The triggers and actions available in the chosen connector are the same regardless of your choice of connection. An on-prem app connection needs to point to a specific [connection profile](/en/on-prem/agents/connection/profile) in your on-prem agent.

You can set up a connection for an on-prem agent in two ways:

- **Cloud profile**: Set up the connection directly in Workato. Refer to [Cloud profiles](/en/on-prem/agents/connection/cloud) for more information.
- **Connection profile**: Set up connection details in the on-prem agent config file. Refer to [Connection profiles](/en/on-prem/agents/connection/profile) for more information.

## Cloud profile

[Cloud profiles](/en/on-prem/agents/connection/cloud) allow you to set up a connection directly in Workato, just like for regular connectors. You don't have to open and edit config file of your on-prem agent.

### Connecting to database using cloud profile

All database connectors give you the option to connect through an on-prem agent. In the connection fields, select the desired on-prem group from the field labeled **Connection type**.

Once you select the on-prem group that allows [cloud profile configuration](/en/on-prem/groups/create-group) you can set up the connection directly in Workato as for the regular cloud connector. Just fill in the required fields and click **Connect**.

### Connecting to on-prem file system using cloud profile

All on-prem files connectors must be connected through an on-prem agent. In the connection fields, select the desired on-prem group from the field labeled **On-prem group**.

Once you select the on-prem group, you can fill in the properties for on-prem file system. Click **Connect** to test your connection.

## Connection profile

When using [connection profile](/en/on-prem/agents/connection/profile) you have to manually fill in the connection details in the config file of your on-prem agent.

### Connecting to database profiles using connection profile

All database connectors give you the option to connect through an on-prem agent. In the connection fields, Select the desired on-prem group from the field labeled **Connection type**.

Once you select the on-prem group, enter the **On-prem connection profile** name. This profile name should be the same as what you configured in the `database` section of the `config.yml` configuration file.

In the following example, we are connecting to a SQL Server database with the profile name `production`.

```yaml
database:
  production:
    adapter: sqlserver
    host: localhost
    username: me
    password: foobar
```

When configuring a SQL Server connection to this profile, we will need to provide the profile name accordingly.

### Connecting to on-prem file system profiles using connection profile

All on-prem files connectors must be connected through an on-prem agent. In the connection fields, Select the desired on-prem group from the field labeled **On-prem group**.

Once you select the on-prem group, enter the **On-prem connection profile** name. This profile name should be the same as what you configured in the `files` section of the `config.yml` configuration file.

```yaml
files:
  hrfiles:
    base: "C:/Documents/HR"
```

When configuring an on-prem files connection to this profile, we will need to provide the profile name accordingly.
