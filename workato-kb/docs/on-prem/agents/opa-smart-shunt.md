# OPA Smart Shunt

OPA Smart Shunt allows users to send data directly from the source system to its destination entirely on-premise.

### OPA Smart Shunt for compliance

The direct "ground-to-ground" integration means that your secure data doesn't leave the data center. This allows your team to remain compliant with your company's security requirements while using Workato to move data between on-premise systems.

### OPA Smart Shunt for increased performance

Additional, OPA Smart Shunt optimizes for high volume and high speed data transfer. When a workflow extracts and loads data entirely on-premise, it allows the workflow to avoid network latency and bypass file transfer size quotas.

## How to use OPA Smart Shunt

For each [on-premise database](#what-databases-support-opa-smart-shunt) connector, there is the **Export query result** action.

This action instructs the on-prem agent to query a local database and export the results as a CSV file. This CSV file is then streamed to an on-premise file storage.

Subsequently, the CSV file can be loaded to a downstream data warehouse.

In this [example recipe](https://app.workato.com/recipes/1515656?st=78d12b), the OPA exports the results from an on-premise PostgreSQL database as a CSV file and uploads it to a local file storage.
