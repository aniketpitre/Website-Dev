> Reference for Workato collaborator privileges, detailing the permissions each role has across recipe development, platform tools, and admin features.

# Collaborator privileges

Collaborator privileges determine the exact permissions that each **role** has to access Workato features, functions, and folders of [Role-based access control](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/).

> **LEGACY MODEL**
> 
> This page describes the legacy permissions model. Workato is replacing legacy roles with the new permissions model, which uses environment roles and project roles. Refer to the [New permissions model](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/access-control-v2) documentation to plan and migrate.

This document provides information about each of the collaborator privileges in Workato.

Refer to [Collaborator roles](/en/roles) to find out about possible collaborator roles.

When you create or modify a role, you'll see the following tabs:

- [Recipe development](#recipe-development-privileges)
- [Platform tools](#platform-tools-privileges)
- [Admin privileges](#admin-privileges)
- [XChange](#xchange)
- [Manage customers (Embedded only)](#manage-customers)

## Recipe development privileges

The **Recipe development** tab controls access and privileges related to projects, recipes, folders, and connections:

- [Project access](#project-access)
- [Recipe creation](#recipe-creation)
- [Decision models](#decision-models)
- [Genie building](#genie-building)
- [Test Automation](#test-automation)
- [Workflow app](#workflow-app)
- [Data storage](#data-tables)
- [Debug jobs](#debug-jobs)
- [Deployment](#deployment)

Workato skips environment roles without any collaborators, and environment roles with the same access level share one project role.
> 
> You can access event stream access through either [project-level](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/privileges-reference#project-assets) or [environment-level](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/privileges-reference#tools) privileges during the [transition period](/en/event-streams#event-streams-as-project-assets).

#### Recipe lifecycle management

- Privileges to recipe lifecycle management
  - Full access
  - Access to the [Recipe lifecycle management (RLCM)](/en/recipe-development-lifecycle.html) feature. This includes the ability to create manifests and view and interact with all assets included in manifests.

> **RLCM PRIVILEGES**
> 
> The Recipe lifecycle management privilege can indirectly provide collaborators with access to assets that are normally restricted by their assigned permission scope. This is because the RLCM privilege grants access to all manifests within a workspace. This means that a collaborator with this privilege can view assets in a manifest, even if they wouldn't normally have access to the project that contains these assets.
> 
> For example:
> 
> - `User A` creates `Project 1` and builds a manifest with RLCM and exports it
> - `User B` has the RLCM permission but no access to `Project 1`
> - `User B` can't access `Project 1` in the UI or use RLCM to build a manifest package with `Project 1` assets
> 
> `User B` can view, download, and use the export package that `User A` created, which contains the `Project 1` content.
> 
> Workato recommends regularly deleting manifests if you do not plan to provide access to the contents of these files to other users of Recipe lifecycle management (RLCM). This practice helps maintain the security and privacy of your data.
> 
> For enhanced security, you can use the [Deployment](/en/features/environments/deploying-projects-to-an-environment) feature. This feature leverages the export-import functionality to facilitate the transfer of assets, making it a more secure and efficient method to move assets across your environments.
> 
> Learn more about [RLCM](/en/recipe-development-lifecycle/rdlc-guide-planning).
