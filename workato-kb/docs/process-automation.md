## Event-driven automation

Event-driven automation is a powerful approach that allows workflows, or "recipes," to be triggered by specific events occurring within or across applications, systems, or services. This model is pivotal for creating responsive, efficient, and real-time integrations and automations across a variety of business processes.

### Key features of event-driven automation in Workato

- Triggers
  
- At the heart of event-driven automation in Workato are [triggers](/en/recipes/triggers#triggers). A trigger is an event in an application or system that starts a Workato recipe. These can be diverse, such as the creation of a new record in a database, a new file in a storage system, a message posted in a chat application, or a custom event from a web application through webhooks. Workato supports a wide array of triggers, enabling recipes to start based on real-time data changes or specific conditions.
  
- Real-time and polling triggers
  
- Workato offers both real-time and polling triggers. [Real-time triggers](/en/recipes/triggers#real-time-triggers) respond immediately to events as they happen, whereas [polling triggers](/en/recipes/triggers#polling-triggers) check for new data at specified intervals. This flexibility allows you to choose the most efficient way to initiate automations based on the criticality of tasks and the capabilities of the source systems.
  
- Webhooks
  
- For applications and systems that support [webhooks](/en/connectors/workato-webhooks), Workato can directly receive real-time data. This is an efficient way to implement event-driven automation, as it allows Workato recipes to be triggered instantly by external events without the need for polling.
  
- Customizable logic and actions
  
- Once an event triggers a recipe, Workato allows for complex logic to be applied to the incoming data, enabling [conditional actions](/en/recipes/steps#if-condition-step), [data transformation](/en/data-orchestration/data-transformation-capabilities), and integration with multiple systems within a single workflow. This means that based on the event, Workato can route data and perform a wide range of actions across connected applications.
