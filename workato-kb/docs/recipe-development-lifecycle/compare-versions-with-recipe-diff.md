> Learn how the Workato Recipe Diff feature visually compares two recipe or skill versions so you can review changes side by side.

# Using a recipe diff to compare recipe changes

Workato tracks all changes made to recipes and skills. A new version of the skill or recipe is created when the skill or recipe is saved.

The Recipe Diff feature enables you to visually compare two skill or recipe versions and review the changes.

In this guide, we'll cover:

- [How the Recipe Diff feature works](#how-it-works)
- [The types of changes included in Recipe Diffs](#change-types)
- [How to access and use Recipe Diffs](#usage)

## How it works

Check out this video guide

The Recipe Diff (or difference) feature visually compares any two skill or recipe versions and highlights their differences.

In tools like GitHub, the diff feature shows a text comparison. For example:

In Workato, the Recipe Diff feature shows a visual difference between two skill or recipe versions. Recipe Diffs make it easier to review the changes and discuss them as part of the recipe development lifecycle. For example:

How changes are displayed depends on the [type of change](#change-types).

## Change types

The Recipe Diff feature tracks the following types of recipe changes:

- [Adding a step](#add-step-change-type)
- [Deleting a step](#remove-step-change-type)
- [Moving a step](#move-step-change-type)
- [Nesting or unnesting a step](#nest-unnest-step-change-type)
- [Updating a step's configuration](#updated-step-config-change-type)
- [Skipping or unskipping a step](#skip-unskip-step-change-type)

**Note**: Any combination of the following changes can happen in a single step. For example, a step's position or configuration can change, along with being (un)skipped or (un)nested.

### Adding a step

When a new step is added to a skill or recipe version, the step is highlighted in green:

### Deleting a step

When a step is deleted from a skill or recipe version, the step is highlighted in red:

### Moving a step

When a step is moved in a skill or recipe version, the step is highlighted in blue and a label describing the movement will display:

### Nesting or unnesting a step

When a step is nested or unnested in a skill or recipe version, the step is highlighted in blue and a **Nested** or **Unnested** label will display:

### Updating a step's configuration

When a step's configuration is changed, the step is highlighted in blue and an **Updated config** label displays. Furthermore, within the step configuration, field addition, removal, and updates will be displayed.

### Skipping or unskipping a step

When [a step is skipped or unskipped](/en/recipes/steps/skip-step) in a skill or recipe version, the step is highlighted in blue and a **Skipped** or **Unskipped** label displays:
