> Connect the Approval bot accelerator to Slack or Microsoft Teams and your source applications so it can route approval requests.

# Connect the Approval bot accelerator to your applications

Where you plan to implement the Approval bot accelerator determines the applications you must connect. For example, if you plan to implement the Approval bot in Slack, you must connect Slack to your Workato workspace. Similarly, you must connect to Microsoft Teams to implement the Approval bot in Microsoft Teams.

## Connect to Slack

Add a custom bot to your Workato workspace and connect it to your Workato instance by following these steps:

1. Sign in to your Workato account.
   
2. Go to **Platform** and select **Workbot**.
