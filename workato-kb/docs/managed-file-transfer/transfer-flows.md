> Configure file transfers to automate file movement between systems, including detection, validation, transformation, and delivery.

# Transfer orchestration

File transfers automate the movement of files between systems. Each transfer manages the full lifecycle, including detection, validation, transformation, delivery, and deletion. Transfers include built-in scheduling, processing, and error handling.

![A configured file transfer](/assets/transfer-flow.CvXJy7Eh.png)_A configured file transfer_

- **Source**: Monitors a location for new files and picks them up based on a schedule.
  
- **Target:** File transfers upload files to a target location after processing.
  

## Supported endpoint types

File transfers support the following connections as a source or target:

- [Workato FileStorage](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-console)
- External SFTP server

Workato plans to support the following additional connections:

- Amazon S3
- Azure Blob Storage
- Sharepoint
- HTTPS

Refer to the [Add a source](#add-a-source) and [Add a target](#add-a-target) sections for more information about connections.

> **ON-PREMISES ENDPOINTS**
> 
> Use the Workato OPA for dedicated MFT use cases such as transferring files directly between two on-premises SFTP servers without routing file payloads through the Workato Cloud.

## Configure a file transfer

Each file transfer supports one source and one target. Complete the following steps to create a new file transfer that automates file movement between systems:

1. Click **Create > File transfer**. The **Create a file transfer** modal displays.
   
   ![The Create a file transfer modal](/assets/create-file-transfer.DHizzDBT.png)_The **Create a file transfer** modal_
   
2. Enter a descriptive **Transfer name**. For example: `Partner Orders Import` or `Daily Report to S3`. Names must be unique within a project.
   
3. Optional. Enter a **Description** of what the transfer does. This field has a maximum of 350 characters.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the file transfer.
   
5. Click **Start building**. The file transfer is created in an **Inactive** state and the **Transfer** page displays.
   
6. Refer to [Add a source](#add-a-source) and [Add a target](#add-a-target) to complete the remaining set up steps.
   

### Add a source

Sources define where to pick up files, when to check for new files, and how to handle source files after a successful transfer.

Complete the following steps to add a source to your file transfer:

1. Select the **File transfer** asset you plan to configure.
   
2. Click **\+ Add source**. The **Add source** setup wizard displays.
   
   ![The Add source setup wizard](/assets/add-source.27HRMRXM.png)_The **Add source** setup wizard_
   
3. Enter a descriptive name in the **Source name** field. For example: `Partner SFTP` or `Bank Reports`. This name appears in logs and monitoring.
   
4. Use the **Source type** drop-down menu to select a connection type. Workato supports the following connections:
   
   - [Workato FileStorage](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-console)
   - External SFTP server
   
   Workato plans to support the following additional connections:
   
   - Amazon S3
   - Azure Blob Storage
   - Sharepoint
   - HTTPS
5. Connections are reusable across all flow assets including file transfers. Use the **Connection** drop-down menu to select a connection if your **Source type** is **External SFTP**. You can also click **Create new connection**, then click **Refresh** to update the list.
   
6. Enter the folder path to retrieve files from in the **Source directory path** field. Ensure the source connection has permission to download from this path.
   
7. Use the **Only transfer files with a successful virus scan** toggle to set the transfer's security scan behavior if your **Source type** is **FileStorage**. FileStorage automatically scans files up to 100 MB.
   
8. Enter a pattern to filter files by in the **File name filter** field. Use the drop-down menu to select a pattern type. Select **Wildcard** for simple patterns or [Regex](/en/regex) for advanced matching.
   
   Wildcards
   
   Wild card patterns use the following format:
   
   - Single character wildcard `?`
     
   - Represents one instance of any character. For example, `Report_draft_?.pdf` can represent `Report_draft_1.pdf`, `Report_draft_2.pdf` or `Report_draft_3.pdf`.
     
   - Multiple character wildcard `*`
     
   - Represents zero or more instances of any character. For example, `Report_draft*.pdf` can represent `Report_draft.pdf`, `Report_draft_1.pdf`, `Report_draft_2.pdf` or `Report_draft_3.pdf`.
     
   
9. Use the **Source file handling** to configure what happens to files at the source after a successful transfer:
   
   - **Keep at source** (default): Files remain at the source directory.
   - **Archive**: Moves the file to a configured archive subfolder. Requires write and delete permission at the source. Archived files can't be retried from the UI.
   - **Delete**: Permanently deletes the file. Requires delete permission at the source. Deleted files can't be retried from the UI.
10. Click **Next**, then refer to the [Schedule transfers](#schedule-transfers) section to configure the transfer schedule.
    

#### Schedule transfers

Complete the following steps to schedule file transfers after you [add a source](#add-a-source):

**Intervals**

1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select the scale for your schedule, such as `Minutes`, `Hours`, or `Days`.
   
   ![The Schedule transfer page](/assets/schedule.6qZfYvxP.png)_The **Schedule transfer** page_
   
2. Enter an interval in the **Trigger every** field based on the selected time unit.
   
   For example, select **Hours** and enter **12** to trigger the transfer every 12 hours. The minimum interval you can set is 5 minutes.
   
3. Select a **Timezone** for the schedule. This field defaults to your workspace's timezone when left blank.
   
4. Enter a start date and time in the **Start after** field or leave it blank to start after activation.
   
5. Click **Add** to add the source, then continue to [Add a target](#add-a-target) to configure where to deliver files and what processing actions to perform on files before delivery.
   

**Custom schedule (Cron expressions)**

1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**. This allows you to define scheduling with a cron expression.
   
2. Enter a schedule in the **Cron expression** field using the following format:
   
   ```text
   [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
   ```
   
   - `*`: Any value
   - `,`: Value list separator
   - `-`: Value range
   - `/`: Step values
   
   For example, enter `0 8 * * *` to sync every day at 8:00 AM.
   
3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. This field defaults to your workspace's timezone when left blank.
   
4. Optional. Select a date and time to start the transfer in the **When first started, this transfer should pick up records from** field or leave it blank to start immediately.
   
   You can't change this value after you run the transfer. Refer to the [When first started, this recipe should pick up events from](/en/recipes/triggers#since-from) section for more information.
   
5. Click **Add** to add the source, then continue to [Add a target](#add-a-target) to configure where to deliver files and what processing actions to perform on files before delivery.
   

### Add a target

Targets define where to deliver files and what processing actions to perform on files before delivery.

Complete the following steps to add a target to your file transfer:

1. Select the **File transfer** asset you plan to configure.
   
2. Click **\+ Add target**. The **Add target** setup wizard displays.
   
   ![The Add target setup wizard](/assets/add-target.Cv4ndcY7.png)_The **Add target** setup wizard_
   
3. Enter a descriptive name for the target in the **Target name** field. This name appears in logs and monitoring.
   
4. Use the **Target type** drop-down menu to select a connection type. Workato supports the following connections:
   
   - [Workato FileStorage](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-console)
   - External SFTP server
   
   Workato plans to support the following additional connections:
   
   - Amazon S3
   - Azure Blob Storage
   - Sharepoint
   - HTTPS
5. Use the **Connection** drop-down menu to select a connection if your **Target type** is **External SFTP**. Connections are reusable across all flow assets including file transfers. You can also click **Create new connection**, then click **Refresh** to update the list.
   
6. Enter the folder path to deliver files to in the **Target directory path** field. Ensure the target connection has the permission to upload to this path.
   
7. Use the **When a file already exists at destination** field to configure conflict resolution:
   
   - **Skip** (default): Doesn't transfer the file and logs the event as **Skipped**. Note that skipped files are considered successful runs, so the source-file handling rule configured in **Set up source** still applies.
   - **Overwrite**: Replaces the existing file at the destination. The original file is permanently replaced and can't be recovered.
8. Click **Next**, then continue to [Processing actions](#processing-actions).
   

#### Processing actions

Processing actions are performed on files after pickup from the source and before delivery to the target. Workato MFT supports the following processing actions:

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| PGP encryption | Encrypt files using a PGP public key. Create and select a connection to the [PGP tools by Workato](/en/connectors/pgp-by-workato#set-up-pgp-tools-by-workato) connector to define your PGP keys for this transfer. |
| PGP decryption | Decrypt files using a PGP private key. Create and select a connection to the [PGP tools by Workato](/en/connectors/pgp-by-workato#set-up-pgp-tools-by-workato) connector to define your PGP keys for this transfer. |
| Rename | Rename files dynamically using functions and the following variables: **Original file name:** The source file name without an extension., **Original file extension:** The file extension. For example: `.csv` |
| Compression | Compress files into ZIP, TAR, or GZIP format. |
| Decompression | Decompress ZIP, TAR, or GZIP formatted files. The archive must contain only one file. |

Complete the following steps to define processing actions after you [add a target](#add-a-target):

1. Select the **File transfer** asset you plan to configure.
   
2. Click **...** (ellipsis) on the target.
   
3. Click **Edit processing actions**.
   
4. Click **\+ Add action** to add a new processing action.
   
5. Configure the action, then click **Save**.
   

### Configure settings

The **Settings** page allows you to configure the following aspects of your file transfer:

**Retry settings**

Workato uses exponential backoff with jitter for optimal retry behavior.

Configure the retry behavior for failed runs using the following settings:

- **Maximum retry duration**: Set a maximum duration for retry attempts. The minimum value is `5 minutes`, the maximum is `24 hours`, and the default is `1 hour`. Individual attempts have a quota of 8 hours, regardless of your selection.
  
- **Maximum retry attempts**: Enter a quota for the number of retry attempts. The maximum value is `10` and the default is `3`.
  

Workato stops retrying a run when either the duration or the attempt quota is reached, whichever comes first. For example, a **Maximum retry attempts** value of `3` allows 1 original attempt and 3 automatic retries for a total of 4 attempts per run.

Refer to the [Error handling and retries](/en/managed-file-transfer/error-handling-and-retries) documentation for more information.

**Concurrency**

Use the **Concurrency limit** setting to configure the number of runs the file transfer processes simultaneously. Select a higher number for high volume transactions.

**Auto-stop on errors**

Use the **Consecutive run error threshold** setting to configure the number of consecutive runs that must exhaust their retry attempts and fail before Workato stops the transfer. The minimum value is `1`. This setting applies per transfer and can't be disabled.

Refer to [Transfer auto-stop](/en/managed-file-transfer/error-handling-and-retries#transfer-auto-stop) for more information.

## Start a transfer

Complete the following steps to start a file transfer after adding a [source](#add-a-source) and a [target](#add-a-target):

1. Select the **File transfer** asset you plan to start.
   
2. Click **Start transfer**. The status changes from **Inactive** to **Active**. Transfers begin based on the schedule and **Start after** time configured during [source setup](#add-a-source). Restarting a stopped transfer doesn't trigger an immediate poll; it waits until the next scheduled poll time.
   

## Check for files now

Complete the following steps to poll a file transfer immediately, without waiting for its next scheduled poll:

1. Select the **File transfer** asset you plan to poll.
   
2. Go to the **Runs** tab.
   
   ![The Runs tab](/assets/runs-tab.BCeepQik.png)_The **Runs** tab_
   
3. Click **Check for files now**.
   
   The transfer checks for new files and reschedules the next poll based on the current time and the configured poll interval.
   

## Stop a transfer

Complete the following steps to stop a file transfer:

1. Select the **File transfer** asset you plan to stop.
   
2. Click **Stop transfer**. The status changes from **Active** to **Inactive**.
   
   Scheduled runs pause and in-progress file transfers complete. Transfers you [resume](#start-a-transfer) continue processing files from the poll event where they stopped.
   

## Quotas

File transfers have the following quotas:

| Description | Quota |
| --- | --- |
| Maximum file size for a file transfer | No limit |
| Maximum duration of a single transfer attempt | 8 hours |
