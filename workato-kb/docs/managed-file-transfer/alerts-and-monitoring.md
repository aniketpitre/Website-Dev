> Monitor Managed File Transfer with run history, logs, performance analytics, and configurable notifications for visibility into transfers.

# Alerts and monitoring

Workato provides detailed logs, run and attempt history, and configurable notifications to enhance visibility into file transfer operations.

## Run history and analytics

The **Runs** tab of a file transfer asset provides a historical view of transfers.

Each run displays the following:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **File name** | The name of the transferred file. |
| **Start time** | When the transfer started. |
| **End time** | When the transfer ended. |
| **File size** | The size of the transferred file. |
| **Status** | Each run displays one of the following statuses: **Queued**: File detected, waiting to process.; **Running**: Transfer in progress.; **Successful**: Transfer completed. Displays the number of retries used, if applicable.; **Failed**: Transfer failed after exhausting all automatic retry attempts. Refer to [Error handling and retries](/en/managed-file-transfer/error-handling-and-retries) for more information.; **Stopped**: File wasn't picked up because the transfer auto-stopped before this run started. Refer to [Transfer auto-stop](/en/managed-file-transfer/error-handling-and-retries#transfer-auto-stop) for more information. |
| **Duration** | How long the transfer took. |

Additionally, the **Runs** tab provides the following capabilities:

- Use the search bar to search file names.
  
- Use the **Period** and **Status** drop-down menus to filter logs.
  
- Click **Retry** on a failed row to retry a single transfer or click **Retry all failed** to retry all failed transfers.
  
- Select a row to view its detailed [attempt history](#attempt-history).
  

### Attempt history

You can select a row in the **Runs** tab to view its attempt history and the details of each attempt:

**For each attempt**

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Attempt** | The attempt number. |
| **Provenance** | How the attempt was initiated: **Original** for the first attempt, **Auto-retry** for an automatic retry, or **Manual retry** followed by the name of the user who triggered it. |
| **Start time** | When the attempt started. |
| **End time** | When the attempt ended. |
| **Status** | The outcome of the attempt. |
| **Duration** | How long the attempt took. |
| **Details** | The error message for failed attempts, or a success summary. |

**Overall**

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **File run ID** | The unique identifier for the file run. Used to find the run in [Workato Logs](#workato-logs). |
| **Source path** | The full path of the source file. |
| **Start time** | When the first attempt started. |
| **End time** | When the final attempt ended. |
| **Duration** | Total time across all attempts. |
| **Attempted automatic retries** | The number of automatic retries used. |

Use the **Attempt type** drop-down menu to filter by original transfers, auto-retries, or manual retries and the **Status** drop-down menu to filter by outcome.

## Workato Logs
