> Set up Workato MFT file servers as managed SFTP and FTPS endpoints so external partners and systems can securely upload and download files.

# File servers

Workato MFT file servers are managed endpoints hosted by Workato. External partners and systems connect to these servers to upload and download files securely.

File servers differ from SFTP and FTP connectors. Connectors let Workato act as a **client** and connect to external servers. File servers let external systems connect to Workato as a **host**.

> **FILESTORAGE**
> 
> [Workato FileStorage](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-connector) works with MFT file servers to manage the full file lifecycle. FileStorage automatically stores files for processing, archival, or distribution when they arrive at your SFTP or FTP(s) servers.

## SFTP server

Workato's SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) server supports secure, encrypted file transfer using the SSH protocol on port 22. SFTP encrypts all data in transit to protect both files and credentials from interception. This option is recommended for all external partner integrations and internet-facing file transfers.

Workato SFTP server allows you to:

- Provide secure upload and download endpoints for partners and legacy systems.
  
- Authenticate users with SSH keys (recommended) or passwords.
  
- Restrict access to specific IP addresses or ranges. Use this when your partner uses static IPs and you plan to block unauthorized attempts.
  
- Create isolated user accounts with folder-level access control.
  
- Monitor connections and file activity with [detailed logs](#server-logs).
  

### Set up an SFTP endpoint

Complete the following steps to enable SFTP server in your workspace:

1. Go to **Platform > Managed File Transfer > File Services > SFTP server**.
   
2. Click **Enable SFTP server**.
   
   ![Enable SFTP server](/assets/sftp-server.DqNy2jfM.png)_Enable SFTP server_
   
3. Enter a unique workspace identifier in the **Set up identifier** dialog. This identifier must be unique within your Workato workspace and has a maximum length of 50 characters.
   
   Refer to [Change your workspace identifier](#change-your-workspace-identifier) to update the identifier later.
   
4. Click **Set up** to confirm and save your identifier.

The server is enabled immediately, and the connection details, including hostname and port, display on the page.

### Create an SFTP account

You can create user accounts to grant external entities access to the SFTP server after the workspace identifier is configured. Each account has isolated access to the folders you specify.

Complete the following steps to create an SFTP account:

1. Go to **Platform > Managed File Transfer > File Services > Accounts**.
   
   ![The Accounts page](/assets/create-account.BKp2Cnlt.png)_The **Accounts** page_
   
2. Click **Create account**. The **Create an account** modal opens.
   
3. Enter a **Username** for the SFTP account. The username must be between 3 and 32 characters and only use alphanumeric characters. Workato automatically appends your workspace identifier to create the full username. For example: `name+workspace-identifier`.
   
   ![Create an account](/assets/create-account-modal.4QS5zsoq.png)_Create an account_
   
4. Use the **Authentication type** drop-down menu to select one or both authentication methods. Refer to the following tabs for configuration steps for each option:
   
   **Password**
   
   Enter a secure password in the **Enter a secure password** field.
   
   **SSH key**
   
   Click **\+ Add key** and paste a public key in OpenSSH format in the **SSH public keys** field. SFTP accounts support RSA, Ed25519, ECDSA, and DSA algorithms.
   
5. Use the **Root directory** drop-down to select a directory. Your selection becomes the user's home directory. Users can't navigate above this directory.
   
6. Use the **Permissions** drop-down menu to select a permission level for the account.
   
   Permission levels
   
   Configure the operations the account can perform using the following permissions levels:
   
   - **Read - Download and list files**: Users can view folders and download files.
   - **Create - Upload new files and folders**: Users can upload files and create new directories.
   - **Modify - Edit existing files**: Users can overwrite existing files or rename them.
   - **Delete - Delete files**: Users can remove files and folders.
   
7. Optional. Use the **IP access list** to restrict access by IP or country. Click **\+ Add rule** to define access rules:
   
   - Set the **Action** field to **Allow** or **Block**
   - Use the **Filter by** field to choose **IP address** or **Country**.
   - Enter a **Value** ,such as an IP address (192.168.1.1) or subnet (192.168.1.0/24) in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation.
8. Click **Create** to save the account.
   

### Change a workspace identifier

Complete the following steps to change a workspace identifier:

1. Go to **Platform > Managed File Transfer > File Services > Accounts**.
   
2. Click the **Edit** icon next to an identifier. The **Edit identifier** modal displays.
   
   ![Click the Edit icon](/assets/edit-identifier.CC4M2Df9.png)_Click the **Edit** icon_
   
3. Enter a new **Identifier**, then click **Save**.
   

> **ACCOUNTS MUST RECONNECT**
> 
> Changing your identifier disables any accounts connected to the server. Accounts must reconnect using the new identifier.

## FTP(s) server

Workato supports systems that require FTP-based file transfer:

**FTPS (FTP Secure)**: Uses TLS and SSL to encrypt file transfer. FTPS provides security similar to HTTPS.

**FTP (legacy)**: The Workato on-prem agent supports standard, unencrypted FTP protocol for internal network transfers.

## Server logs

Workato's logging service captures detailed information for every server activity in **Tools > Logs**. Use these logs to view successful and failed connections, track file uploads and downloads, and troubleshoot errors across file transfers.

![Server logs](/assets/server-logs.Ba7BUF6d.png)_Server logs_

Workato logs the following event types:

- **Authentication events**: Displays whether authentication succeeded or failed, the username, IP address, and reason of failure (if applicable).
  
- **File operations**: Record upload, download, and delete activity, including the username, file path, size, IP address, and failure reason (if applicable).
  

Use the following filters to locate specific logs:

- **Period**: Select a preset such as `Last 30 days` or define a custom date range.
  
- **Log type**: Select `File Servers` to view logs related to MFT file server activity.
  
- **Log level**: Select `INFO` to view successful events or `ERROR` to investigate failures.
