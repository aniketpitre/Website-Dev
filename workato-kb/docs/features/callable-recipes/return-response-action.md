# Callable recipes by Workato - Return response from recipe action

This action responds to the recipe call with a status confirmation together with any data. This action will respond with a data format defined in the [New call for recipe](/en/features/callable-recipes/new-call-trigger) trigger.

> **THIS ACTION IS DEPRECATED**
> 
> This action is deprecated and applies only to legacy callable recipes with the [New call for recipe trigger](/en/features/callable-recipes/new-call-trigger). If you use this action with any other trigger, an error occurs.
> 
> Existing recipes that use this action continue to work. For new recipes, use the [Recipe functions - Return data from a recipe function](/en/connectors/recipe-functions/actions/return-data-from-a-recipe-function) action. Refer to the [Recipe functions FAQ](/en/features/callable-recipes/recipe-functions-faq) for more information.
