# Callable recipes by Workato - New call for recipe trigger

This trigger creates a job whenever it is called, in real-time. It can be called from [another recipe](/en/features/callable-recipes/call-recipe-action) or from another system as a [API Platform REST endpoint](/en/api-management).

> **THIS TRIGGER IS DEPRECATED**
> 
> This trigger has been replaced by the following triggers:
> 
> - [Recipe functions - New function call trigger](/en/connectors/recipe-functions/triggers/new-function-call) - Creates a recipe that can be called from another recipe
> - [API platform - New API request trigger](/en/api-mgmt/api-recipes/trigger-new-api-request) - Creates a job based on API requests
> 
> Recipes using this trigger will continue to function. Use the new **Recipe functions** and **API platform** triggers instead to take advantage of new features - check out the [Recipe functions FAQ](/en/features/callable-recipes/recipe-functions-faq) and [API platform FAQ](/en/api-mgmt/api-recipes/api-recipes-faq) for more info.

  

> **INFO**
> 
> API Platform must be enabled for your workspace before you can expose a callable recipe as a REST endpoint.
