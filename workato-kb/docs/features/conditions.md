> Learn how to build IF conditions in Workato recipes using a data field, condition, and value, and combine them with AND or OR operators.

# Conditions

Create **IF** conditions in your Workato recipes by defining three key components: a **Data field**, a **Condition**, and a **Value**. The **Data field** is the variable data from your app, for example, case status, or lead rating. The **Value** is the static value you plan to check against, such as `Closed` or `Hot`. Data fields and values are case sensitive.

This section covers fourteen available conditions, with trigger conditions as examples. You can also combine multiple conditions with the `AND` or `OR` operators to create complex logic.

Each condition is compatible with different data types. Using a condition with an invalid data type may prevent the recipe from starting or functioning correctly.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/nOkGS8fYv5g)

If an invalid **IF** condition is set up for triggers, the recipe may:

- Throw a trigger error after starting, preventing it from picking up trigger events.
- Filter out all trigger events.

## Where conditions can be used

You can use conditions in the following features to refine your workflow:

- **IF control statements:** Use conditions within [IF control statements](/en/features/if-conditions) to execute specific steps or actions based on your data.
  
- **While loop:** Create conditions within a [repeat while loop](/en/recipes/loops) to repeat actions until a specific condition is met.
  
- **Trigger conditions:** Set [trigger conditions](/en/recipes/triggers#trigger-conditions) to filter which trigger events are processed by the recipe, ensuring only relevant events are picked up.

## contains

The **contains** condition allows you to check if a data field contains a specified value within a sequence of conditional checks. This approach is useful when you must route or process data differently based on the presence of specific content. This condition is the inverse of the [doesn't contain](#does-not-contain) condition and is case-sensitive. You can adjust the case of both the data and value for case-insensitive comparisons as required.

![Example contains recipe](/assets/elseif-contains.uI4SUVRA.png)_The control statement processes new Google Calendar events only if the event `Summary` contains the word `Review`._

### Compatible data types

This condition is compatible with array and string data types.

### Examples

| Data field | Condition/value | Picked up by recipe? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UI bug` | `contains` "bug" | Yes |
| `UI BUG` | `contains` "bug" | No |
| `Instructions unclear` | `contains` "bug" | No |
| "" | `contains` "bug" | No |
| `nil` | `contains` "bug" | No |
| `12345` | `contains` 123 | No |
| `[1, 2, 3]` | `contains` 1 | Yes |
| `[1, 2, 3]` | `contains` \[1, 3\] | No |
| `["abc", "pqr", "xyz"]` | `contains` "abc" | Yes |
| `["abc", "pqr", "xyz"]` | `contains` \["abc", "pqr"\] | No |

* * *

## starts with

The **starts with** condition allows you to check if a data field string begins with a specified value in a sequence of conditions. This condition is the inverse of the [doesn't start with](#does-not-start-with) condition and is case-sensitive. Verify that both the data and the value are in the same case (either lowercase or uppercase) to ensure accurate comparisons.

![Example starts with recipe](/assets/elseif-starts-with.B6_UwBDz.png)_The control statement processes new Zendesk users whose phone numbers start with `(810)` or `(749)`._

The **starts with** condition matches exact strings only, and does not recognize null values.

### Compatible data types

This condition is only compatible with string data types.

### Examples

| Data field | Condition/value | Picked up by recipe? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `(408) 555-6928` | `starts with` "(408)" | Yes |
| `408 555-6928` | `starts with` "(408)" | No |
| `(650) 555-2395` | `starts with` "(408)" | No |
| "" | `starts with` "(408)" | No |
| `nil` | `starts with` "(408)" | No |
| `12345` | `starts with` 123 | Trigger error thrown |
| `<kbd>numeric_type_pill</kbd>` | `starts with` 123 | Trigger error thrown |
| `<kbd>numeric_type_pill</kbd>` | `starts with` "123" | Yes #if pill = 12345 |

### Special non-string data type cases

Avoid comparing non-string data types using the **starts with** condition to prevent [trigger errors](/en/recipes/error-notifications#trigger-errors). For example, comparing two number types directly results in an error.

![Comparing number types for starts with condition](/assets/comparing-number-types-starts.Bb5W8LjJ.png)_Trigger errors occur when comparing number types with the **starts with** condition._

In situations where the data field is a non-string datapill and the comparison value is a string, Workato automatically converts the datapill's value to a string for the comparison. The comparison evaluates to true if this converted value meets the condition.

![Comparing number types for starts with condition](/assets/string-conversion-starts.nXXI5iu0.png)_Non-string datapills are converted to a string for comparison if the value is a string_

* * *

## ends with

The **ends with** condition allows you to check if a data field ends with a specific value. This condition is the inverse of the [doesn't end with](#does-not-end-with) condition and is case-sensitive. Verify that both the data and the value are in the same case (either lowercase or uppercase) to ensure accurate comparisons.

![Example ends with recipe](/assets/example-ends-with-recipe.BbcxRZch.png)_The control statement filters Gmail messages from senders whose email address ends with `@partnercompany.com`._

If the field you specify in your condition is left blank in the application you’re using, no event is picked up.

### Compatible data types

This condition is only compatible with string data types.

### Examples

| Data field | Condition/value | Picked up by recipe? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `(408) 555-6928` | `ends with` "6928" | Yes |
| `408 555-6928` | `ends with` "(6928)" | No |
| `(650) 555-2395` | `ends with` "6928" | No |
| "" | `ends with` "6928" | No |
| `nil` | `ends with` "6928" | No |
| `12345` | `ends with` 345 | Trigger error thrown |
| `<kbd>numeric_type_pill</kbd>` | `ends with` 345 | Trigger error thrown |
| `<kbd>numeric_type_pill</kbd>` | `ends with` "345" | Yes #if pill = 12345 |
| `<kbd>numeric_type_pill</kbd>` | `ends with` "345" | No #if pill = 123 |

### Special non-string data type cases

Avoid comparing non-string data types using the **ends with** condition to prevent [trigger errors](/en/recipes/error-notifications#trigger-errors). For example, comparing two number types directly results in an error.

![Comparing number types for ends with condition](/assets/comparing-number-types-ends.CdC1Of2y.png)_Trigger errors occur when comparing number types with the **ends with** condition._

In situations where the data field is a non-string datapill and the comparison value is a string, Workato automatically converts the datapill's value to a string for the comparison. The comparison evaluates to true if this converted value meets the condition.

![Comparing number types for ends with condition](/assets/string-conversion-ends.u562cyBZ.png)_Non-string datapills are converted to a string for comparison if the value is a string._

* * *

## does not contain

The **doesn't contain** condition allows you to define actions when specific values are absent in your data fields. This condition is the inverse of the [contains](#contains) condition and is case-sensitive. Verify that both the data and the value are in the same case (either lowercase or uppercase) to ensure accurate comparisons.

![Example doesn't contain recipe](/assets/example-doesnt-contain-recipe.vIcm4-Cq.png)_The control statement filters emails whose subjects do not contain `Meeting reminder`._

> **BLANK FIELDS**
> 
> If the field you've specified is blank, the **doesn’t contain** condition does not trigger an event. You can prevent this from occurring by using a string formula with the [is true](#is-true) or [is present](#is-present) condition.

### Compatible data types

This condition is only compatible with array and string data types.

### Examples

| Data field | Condition/value | Picked up by recipe? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UI bug` | `doesn't contain` "bug" | No |
| `UI BUG` | `doesn't contain` "bug" | Yes |
| `Instructions unclear` | `doesn't contain` "bug" | Yes |
| "" | `doesn't contain` "bug" | Yes |
| `nil` | `doesn't contain` "bug" | No |
| `12345` | `doesn't contain` 123 | No |
| `[1, 2, 3]` | `doesn't contain` 1 | No |
| `[1, 2, 3]` | `doesn't contain` \[1, 3\] | Yes |
| `["abc", "pqr", "xyz"]` | `doesn't contain` "abc" | No |
| `["abc", "pqr", "xyz"]` | `doesn't contain` \["abc", "pqr"\] | Yes |

* * *

## does not start with

The **doesn't start with** condition allows you to define actions when specific starting sequences are absent in your data fields. This condition is the inverse of the [starts with](#starts-with) condition and is case-sensitive. Verify that both the data and the value are in the same case (either lowercase or uppercase) to ensure accurate comparisons.

![Example doesnt start with recipe](/assets/example-doesnt-start-recipe.BGeqDMuI.png)_The control statement in the recipe processes Jira issues where the status category does not start with `In Review`._

> **BLANK FIELDS**
> 
> If the field you've specified is blank, the **doesn’t start with** condition does not trigger an event. You can prevent this from occurring by using a string formula with the [is true](#is-true) or [is present](#is-present) condition.

### Compatible data types

This condition is only compatible with string data types.

### Examples

| Data field | Condition/value | Picked up by recipe? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `(408) 555-6928` | `doesn't start with` "(408)" or "(669)" | No |
| `408 555-6928` | `doesn't start with` "(408)" or "(669)" | Yes |
| `(650) 555-2395` | `doesn't start with` "(408)" or "(669)" | Yes |
| "" | `doesn't start with` "(408)" or "(669)" | Yes |
| `nil` | `doesn't start with` "(408)" or "(669)" | No |
| `12345` | `doesn't start with` 123 | Trigger error thrown |
| `<kbd>numeric_type_pill</kbd>` | `doesn't start with` 123 | Trigger error thrown |
| `<kbd>numeric_type_pill</kbd>` | `doesn't start with` "123" | No #if pill = 12345 |
| `<kbd>numeric_type_pill</kbd>` | `doesn't start with` "123" | Yes #if pill = 345 |

### Special non-string data type cases

Avoid comparing non-string data types using the **doesn't start with** condition to prevent [trigger errors](/en/recipes/error-notifications#trigger-errors). For example, comparing two number types directly results in an error.

![Comparing number types for doesn't start with condition](/assets/comparing-number-types-doesnt-start.CsaEBZTu.png)_Trigger errors occur when comparing number types with the **doesn't start with** condition._

In situations where the data field is a non-string datapill and the comparison value is a string, Workato automatically converts the datapill's value to a string for the comparison. The comparison evaluates to true if this converted value meets the condition.

![Comparing number types for doesn't start with condition](/assets/string-conversion-doesnt-start.BZikn-eR.png)_Non-string datapills are converted to a string for comparison if the value is a string._

If your trigger data is `nil` (or `null`), Workato does not pick up the trigger event, even if it technically meets the condition. For example, `nil` **doesn't start with** `345`.

* * *

## does not end with

The **doesn't end with** condition allows you to define actions for data fields that do not end with a specified value, following an initial **IF** condition. This is the inverse of the [ends with](#ends-with) condition and is case-sensitive. Verify that both the data and the value are in the same case (either lowercase or uppercase) to ensure accurate comparisons.

![Example doesn't end with recipe](/assets/example-doesnt-end-recipe.RI9uDL8C.png)_The control statement filters DocuSign documents whose titles do not end with `Contract`._

> **BLANK FIELDS**
> 
> If the field you've specified is blank, the **doesn’t end with** condition does not trigger an event. You can prevent this from occurring by using a string formula with the [is true](#is-true) or [is present](#is-present) condition.

### Compatible data types

This condition is only compatible with string data types.

### Examples

| Data field | Condition/value | Picked up by recipe? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `(408) 555-6928` | `doesn't ends with` "6928" | No |
| `408 555-6928` | `doesn't ends with` "(6928)" | Yes |
| `(650) 555-2395` | `doesn't ends with` "6928" | Yes |
| "" | `doesn't ends with` "6928" | Yes |
| `nil` | `doesn't ends with` "6928" | No |
| `12345` | `doesn't ends with` 345 | Trigger error thrown |
| `<kbd>numeric_type_pill</kbd>` | `doesn't ends with` 345 | Trigger error thrown |
| `<kbd>numeric_type_pill</kbd>` | `doesn't ends with` "345" | No #if pill =12345 |
| `<kbd>numeric_type_pill</kbd>` | `doesn't ends with` "345" | Yes #if pill =123 |

### Special non-string data type cases

Avoid comparing non-string data types using the **doesn't end with** condition to prevent [trigger errors](/en/recipes/error-notifications#trigger-errors). For example, comparing two number types directly results in an error.

![Comparing number types for doesn't end with condition](/assets/comparing-number-types-doesnt-end.CDsQJgOK.png)_Trigger errors occur when comparing number types with the **doesn't end with** condition._

In situations where the data field is a non-string datapill and the comparison value is a string, Workato automatically converts the datapill's value to a string for the comparison. The comparison evaluates to true if this converted value meets the condition.

![Comparing number types for doesn't end with condition](/assets/string-conversion-doesnt-end.E4njqVj3.png)_Non-string datapills are converted to a string for comparison if the value is a string._

If your trigger data is `nil` (or `null`), Workato does not pick up the trigger event, even if it technically meets the condition. For example, `nil` **doesn't end with** `345`.

* * *

## equals

The **equals** condition allows you to define actions for situations when a data field exactly matches a given value. This condition is crucial for processes that depend on exact matches. This condition is the inverse of the [does not equal](#does-not-equal) condition and is case-sensitive. Verify that both the data and the value are in the same case (either lowercase or uppercase) to ensure accurate comparisons.

![Example equals recipe](/assets/example-equals-recipe.dhIdLitg.png)_The control statement in the recipe processes new Okta events if the `Credential type` equals `External`._.

### Compatible data types

This condition is compatible with all data types, such as integers and floats, dates, and arrays.

### Examples

| Data field | Condition/value | Picked up by recipe? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Closed` | `equals` "Closed" | Yes |
| `Closed` | `equals` "closed" | No |
| "" | `equals` "Closed" | No |
| "" | `equals` `null` | No |
| `null` | `equals` `nil` | Yes |
| `nil` | `equals` "Closed" | No |
| `12345` | `equals` 12345 | Yes |
| `12345` | `equals` "12345" | Yes |
| `6 - 1` | `equals` 5 | Yes |
| `Closed.present?` | `equals` `true` | Yes |
| `Closed".present?` | `equals` "true" | No |
| `Closed".present?` | `equals` 1 | No |

### Special cases

Workato converts strings to float data types for comparisons with numeric values. When comparing a number and a string, if the string can be a float, Workato treats it as such for the comparison.

| Data field | Condition | Value | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `1234` | `equals to` | `1234` | Yes |
| `9.99` | `equals to` | `9.99` | Yes |

Floats have limited precision. Comparisons with strings containing more than 15 digits may not be accurate. Use formula mode for precise comparisons in these situations.

| Data field | Condition | Value | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `12345678901234567` | `equals to` | `12345678901234567` | No |
| `12345678901234568` | `equals to` | `12345678901234567` | Yes |

String to numeric coercion also recognizes base-8 notation which converts a `0123` to `83`.

| Data field | Condition | Value | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `83` | `equals to` | `0123` | Yes |

This logic also applies to **does not equal**, **greater than**, and **less than** operations.

* * *

## does not equal

The **does not equal** condition allows you to define actions for cases when a data field does not exactly match a specified value. This condition is crucial for identifying discrepancies or variations in data. This condition is the inverse of the [equals](#equals) condition and is case-sensitive. Verify that both the data and the value are in the same case (either lowercase or uppercase) to ensure accurate comparisons.

![Example does not equal recipe](/assets/example-doesnt-equal-recipe.tFTiPrax.png)_The control statement in the recipe processes new Zendesk tickets only when their `Priority` does not equal `Low`. This approach focuses on tickets with higher priority levels for immediate action._

### Compatible data types

This condition is compatible with all data types, such as integers and floats, dates, and arrays.

### Examples

| Data field | Condition/value | Picked up by recipe? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Closed` | `does not equal` "Closed" | No |
| `Closed` | `does not equal` "closed" | Yes |
| "" | `does not equal` "Closed" | Yes |
| "" | `does not equal` `null` | Yes |
| `null` | `does not equal` `nil` | No |
| `nil` | `does not equal` "Closed" | Yes |
| `12345` | `does not equal` 12345 | No |
| `12345` | `does not equal` "12345" | No |
| `6 - 1` | `does not equal` 5 | No |
| `Closed.present?` | `does not equal` `true` | No |
| `Closed".present?` | `does not equal` "true" | Yes |
| `Closed".present?` | `does not equal` 1 | Yes |

* * *

## greater than

The **greater than** condition allows you to define actions for when a data field's value exceeds a specified number or date. This is particularly effective for prioritizing tasks or records based on numerical or date criteria. This condition is the inverse of the [less than](#less-than) condition.

![Example is greater than recipe](/assets/example-greater-recipe.PuhnjvAh.png)_The control statement in the recipe processes new Salesforce accounts only if their `SLA Expiration Date` is greater than `12/21/2024`. This approach ensures prioritization of accounts based on the urgency of their service agreements._

If **value** is set to a number and the data field is null, the recipe raises an error as a number cannot be compared with null. To address this, use an **is present** condition along with the **greater than** condition for reliable results.

![Example is present and greater than recipe](/assets/example-present-greater-recipe.B0r_JZW5.png)_In addition to the **ELSE IF** condition, adding an **is present** condition ensures the recipe processes new Salesforce opportunities with an existing (non-null) SLA expiration field that is set to expire after `12/21/2024`._

### Compatible data types

This condition is compatible with string, integer, and number data types.

### Examples

| Data field | Condition/value | Picked up by recipe? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `2017-06-31T12:00:00.252805-07:00` | `greater than` "2017-12-31T12:00:00.252805-07:00" | No |
| `2017-06-30T12:00:00.252805-07:00` | `greater than` "2017-01-31T12:00:00.252805-07:00" | Yes |
| `2017-06-31` | `greater than` "2017-12-31" | No |
| `2017-06-31` | `greater than` "2017-01-31" | Yes |
| `5` | `greater than` 10 | No |
| `5` | `greater than` 1 | Yes |
| `1.5` | `greater than` 10.5 | No |
| `1.5` | `greater than` 1.23 | Yes |
| `abc` | `greater than` "abcde" | No #ASCII value comparison |
| `abc` | `greater than` "a" | Yes #ASCII value comparison |
| `nil` | `greater than` "2017-01-31T22:00:00.252805-07:00" | Trigger error thrown |
| `2017-06-31` | `greater than` `nil` | Trigger error thrown |
| `nil` | `greater than` 10 | Trigger error thrown |
| `1.5` | `greater than` `nil` | Trigger error thrown |
| `abc` | `greater than` `nil` | Trigger error thrown |

* * *

## less than

The **less than** condition allows you to define actions for when a data field's value is lower than a specified threshold, following an initial **IF** condition. This is essential for scenarios where ranking or filtering is based on lower numerical or date values. This condition is the inverse of the [greater than](#greater-than) condition.

![Example is less than recipe](/assets/example-less-than.Dijga1ow.png)_The control statement is applied to new Shopify product variants, processing only those whose variant `Price` is less than `50`._

If the **value** is a number and the **data field** is `null`, the recipe throws an error, as you cannot compare a number with `null`. To resolve this, combine an **is present** condition with the **less than** condition.

### Compatible data types

This condition is compatible with string, integer, and number data types.

### Examples

| Data field | Condition/value | Picked up by recipe? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `2017-06-31T12:00:00.252805-07:00` | `less than` "2017-12-31T12:00:00.252805-07:00" | Yes |
| `2017-06-30T12:00:00.252805-07:00` | `less than` "2017-01-31T12:00:00.252805-07:00" | No |
| `2017-06-31` | `less than` "2017-12-31" | Yes |
| `2017-06-31` | `less than` "2017-01-31" | No |
| `5` | `less than` 10 | Yes |
| `5` | `less than` 1 | No |
| `1.5` | `less than` 10.5 | Yes |
| `1.5` | `less than` 1.23 | No |
| `abc` | `less than` "abcde" | Yes #ASCII value comparison |
| `abc` | `less than` "a" | No #ASCII value comparison |
| `nil` | `less than` "2017-01-31T22:00:00.252805-07:00" | Trigger error thrown |
| `2017-06-31` | `less than` `nil` | Trigger error thrown |
| `nil` | `less than` 10 | Trigger error thrown |
| `1.5` | `less than` `nil` | Trigger error thrown |
| `abc` | `less than` `nil` | Trigger error thrown |

* * *

## is true

The **is true** condition allows you to define actions for cases when a boolean data field is `true`, or when a formula evaluates to `true`. This condition is crucial for making decisions based on binary data or specific formula outcomes. This condition is the inverse of the [is not true](#is-not-true) condition.

![Example is true recipe](/assets/example-is-true.C-WX0nay.png)_The control statement processes new Shopify product variants only if the variant's `Requires shipping` field is marked as `true`._

Additionally, you can use the **is true** condition to assess formulas. For example, you can convert string type datapills through [string formulas](/en/formulas/string-formulas) into conditions that evaluate to a boolean.

### Compatible data types

This condition is only compatible with boolean data types. You can use this condition to check against a boolean datapill, or check against a formula that evaluates to `true` or `false`.

### Examples

| Data field | Condition/value | Picked up by recipe? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<kbd>pill</kbd>.present?` | `is true` | No #if pill has a `nil` or `null` value or is an empty string "" |
| `<kbd>pill</kbd>.present?` | `is true` | Yes #if pill has a value |
| `Advanced Solutions".include?("Solutions")` | `is true` | Yes |
| `Advanced Solutions".include?("solutions")` | `is true` | No |

* * *

## is not true

The **is not true** condition allows you to define actions for when a boolean data field is not true or when a formula evaluation results to `false`. This is the inverse of the [is true](#is-true) condition and is crucial for workflows that depend on negative or false evaluations.

![Example is not true recipe](/assets/example-not-true.Cihr0-be.png)_The control statement processes new Google Calendar events only when the `Guests can modify` option is not set to `true`. This ensures the recipe selectively targets events where guests have restricted modification rights._

Additionally, you can use the **is not true** condition to verify if a formula in the trigger data input field results in false. For example, you can convert string type datapills into boolean conditions using [string formulas](/en/formulas/string-formulas), allowing for precise evaluations.

### Compatible data types

This condition is only compatible with boolean data types. You can use this condition to check against a boolean datapill, or check against a formula that evaluates to `true` or `false`.

### Examples

| Data field | Condition/value | Picked up by recipe? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<kbd>pill</kbd>.present?` | `is not true` | No #if pill has a `nil` or `null` value or is an empty string "" |
| `<kbd>pill</kbd>.present?` | `is not true` | No #if pill has a value |
| `Advanced Solutions".include?("Solutions")` | `is not true` | No |
| `Advanced Solutions".include?("solutions")` | `is not true` | Yes |

* * *

## is present

The **is present** condition allows you to define actions based on the presence of data in a specific field. This condition is crucial for workflows that respond to the presence of data rather than its value. If the data field is null or an empty string, the condition does not trigger. This condition is the inverse of the [is not present](#is-not-present) condition.

![Example is present recipe](/assets/example-is-present.BzEDHRQ4.png)_The control statement processes new Box files only when a file `Name` is present. This is particularly useful for ensuring that only files with names are considered for further actions in the recipe._

### Compatible data types

This condition is compatible with all data types, such as integers and floats, dates, and arrays.

### Examples

| Data field | Condition/value | Picked up by recipe? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Advanced Solutions` | `is present` | Yes |
| `12345` | `is present` | Yes |
| "" | `is present` | No |

## is not present

The **is not present** condition allows you to define actions for when a data field is empty or `null`. This condition is essential for workflows that rely on the absence of data to trigger specific actions. The condition does not activate if there is data present in the field. This condition is the inverse of the [is present](#is-present).
