# Use runtime user connections in recipe functions

This guide provides information on how to use [Runtime user connections](/en/features/runtime-user-connections) in **Recipe functions**.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following privileges before you begin:

- **Create/edit Recipes**
- **View/edit Runtime user connections**
- **Create/edit Connections**

* * *

## Create a recipe function

1. Go to your account and create a new **Recipe function**. The recipe must use the [Recipe functions - New function call trigger](/en/connectors/recipe-functions/triggers/new-function-call).
   
2. Add steps and actions. You can choose whether to use runtime user connections or the default recipe connection when selecting app connections for your actions.

3. Save and test the recipe.

## Call the recipe and swap connections

You must define how recipes use the [recipe from Step 1's](#step-1-create-a-recipe-function) runtime user connections:

1. Create a new recipe or open an existing recipe.
   
2. Click **+** (plus) and select **Action in an app**.
   
3. Search for and select the **Recipe function by Workato** connector.
   
4. Select either of the [**Call recipe function (synchronous)**](/en/connectors/recipe-functions/actions/call-recipe-function-synchronously) or [**Call recipe function (asynchronous)**](/en/connectors/recipe-functions/actions/call-recipe-function-asynchronously) actions.
   
5. Go the **Recipe to call** field and select the recipe you created in [Step 1](#step-1-create-a-recipe-function).
   
6. Go to the **Connection overrides** section and configure the connections you plan to use at runtime.
   
7. Click **Save**.
