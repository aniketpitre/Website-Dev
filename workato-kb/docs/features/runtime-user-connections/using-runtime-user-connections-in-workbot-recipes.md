# Use runtime user connections in Workbot recipes

This guide will walk you through using [Runtime user connections](/en/features/runtime-user-connections) in **Workbot recipes**.

Any of Workato's Workbots can be used, including **Workbot for Slack** and **Workbot for Microsoft Teams**.

In this guide, we'll cover:

## Create a Workbot command recipe

1. In your account, create a new **Workbot** recipe.
