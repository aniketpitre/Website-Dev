> Configure SQL Transformations output settings to stream results as a content stream or save them as a file in FileStorage, with format options.

# Configure output settings

Configure the output settings to define how and where your data outputs after SQL transformations. This section guides you through choosing between streaming the output as a content stream or saving it as a file in FileStorage, with various options for formatting and structuring your output data.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring your output settings, ensure you have completed the following steps:

1. [Set up your data source](/en/features/sql-transformations-data-source-setting).
2. [Set up your query](/en/features/sql-transformations-query-setting).

## Configure your output

In this section, configure the output type and additional features for the output data.

- Output type
  
- Select the output type. Use **Content stream** to share the contents as a streamable datapill to downstream actions. Use the **FileStorage file** option to save the output as a file in the FileStorage system.
  
- Content stream input fields
  
- Configure the following fields when you choose **Content stream** as your output type:
  
  - File type
    
  - Select **CSV** or **Excel** as the file format of your output data.
    
  - Include header row
    
  - Set to **Yes** to include column names from the SQL as a header row. The default is set to `No`.
    
  - Column delimiter
    
  - Choose the character to separate columns in the **CSV** contents. This option is available only when you choose **CSV** as the file type. The default is set to `comma`.
    
  - Quote type
    
  - Choose whether to use quotation marks around values. This option is available only when you choose **CSV** as the file type. The default is `Use when necessary`.
    
  - Quote character
    
  - Choose the type of quotation marks to use around the values in the output. This option is available only when you choose **CSV** as the file type. The default is `Double`.
    
  - Sheet name
    
  - Set a custom sheet name for the Excel file. This option is available only when you choose **Excel** as the file type. The output data is added to the first sheet with this name. This field defaults to `Sheet 1` if a sheet name is not provided.
    
  - Start from
    
  - Enter the cell to start inserting data from. This option is available only when you choose **Excel** as the file type. For example, `C1`. This field defaults to `A1`.
    
- FileStorage file input fields Configure the following fields when you choose **FileStorage file** as your output type:
  
  - FileStorage file path
    
  - Provide the file path value. For example, `samplepath/path1/`.
    
  - FileStorage output file name
    
  - Define the output file name for storage in Workato FileStorage.
    
  - File type
    
  - Select **CSV** or **Excel** as the file format of your output data.
    
  - Include header row
    
  - Set to **Yes** to include column names from the SQL as a header row. The default is set to `No`.
    
  - Column delimiter
    
  - Choose the character to separate columns in the CSV contents. This option is available only when you choose **CSV** as the file type. The default is set to `comma`.
    
  - Quote type
    
  - Choose whether to use quotation marks around the values in the output. This option is available only when you choose **CSV** as the file type. The default is `Use when necessary`.
    
  - Quote character
    
  - Choose the type of quotation marks to use around the values in the output. This option is available only when you choose **CSV** as the file type. The default is `Double`.
    
  - Sheet name
    
  - Set a custom sheet name for the Excel file. This option is available only when you choose **Excel** as the file type. The output data is added to the first sheet with this name. This defaults to `Sheet 1` if a sheet name is not provided.
    
  - Start from
    
  - Enter the cell to start inserting data from. This option is available only when you choose **Excel** as the file type. For example, `C1`. This field defaults to `A1`.
    

### Example output setup: Store output in Workato FileStorage (CSV)

In this example, the query output is stored in Workato FileStorage with the filename `Employee_Zipcode_SQL.csv` under a specific folder called `SQL`. Column names from the query are included as the header row in the file, and `,` (comma) is set as the column delimiter separating the data in the output CSV file.

### Example output setup: Store output in Workato FileStorage (Excel)

In this example, the query output is stored in Workato FileStorage with the filename `Employee_Data.xlsx` under a specific folder called `SQL`. The sheet name is set to `EmployeeSheet`, column names from the query are included as the header row, and data insertion starts from cell `B2`.
