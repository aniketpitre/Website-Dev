# Handling JSON FAQs

Get answers to frequently asked JSON handling questions.

What is JSON, and why is it important in the context of Workato?

[JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](/en/features/handling-json#handling-json) is a data syntax used for storing and exchanging data. It is a popular and widely used format in the world of APIs. JSON is based on name/value pairs and arrays, making it highly readable and easily transmitted. In Workato, JSON is essential for handling data within recipes.

How does Workato typically handle JSON data?

Workato exposes [JSON data](/en/features/handling-json#json-parser-by-workato) as input fields and output datapills in recipes, making JSON mostly transparent to regular users. However, you may occasionally handle raw JSON data in specific workflow automation.

What is an example of JSON data?

The following [JSON data example](/en/connectors/json-by-workato/parse-json-action#example-usage) represents an array of contacts:

```json
[
  {
    "Name" : {
      "first_name" : "Sally",
      "last_name" : "Jones"
    },
    "Address": {
      "street" : "20450 Stevens Creek Blvd #150",
      "city" : "Cupertino",
      "st" : "CA",
      "postal": "95014"
    },
    "phone" : "4105554119"
  },
  {
    "Name" : {
      "first_name" : "Bob",
      "last_name" : "Towner"
    },
    "Address": {
      "street" : "1 Hacker Way",
      "city" : "Menlo Park",
      "st" : "CA",
      "postal": "94025"
    },
    "phone" : "8552982507"
  }
]
```

How can I parse JSON data in Workato?

Use the [Parse JSON document action](/en/connectors/json-by-workato/parse-json-action) from JSON tools by Workato. This action extracts values from raw JSON based on a sample structure you provide.

What are the input fields for the JSON parser in Workato?

The [Parse JSON document action input fields](/en/connectors/json-by-workato/parse-json-action#input) include the following:

- **Sample document**: A sample JSON structure that defines the expected format.
- **Document**: The actual JSON content to parse at runtime.
- **Encoding of the file content**: Set the character encoding.
- **Edit schema**: Refine or override the generated output schema.

What can I expect as the output of the JSON parser in Workato?

Datapills are generated using the JSON format in the **Sample document** field. For example, if your JSON contains an array with objects such as `Name` and `Address`, the [output includes datapills that correspond to these objects and their properties](/en/connectors/json-by-workato/parse-json-action#output).

Are there alternatives to the built-in JSON parser for handling JSON data?

Yes. If you frequently work with raw JSON data, we recommend that you consider more permanent solutions, such as custom connectors. [Workato offers two primary options](/en/features/handling-json#developing-custom-connectors):

- **HTTP connector:** This is a convenient way to handle raw data from APIs. You can build HTTP triggers and actions to manage JSON data.
  
- **Workato Connector SDK:** This extension of the Workato framework supports various authentication procedures and allows developers to build, maintain, and distribute connectors to integration-seekers.
