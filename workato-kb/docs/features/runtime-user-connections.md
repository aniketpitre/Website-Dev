> Learn how runtime user connections let recipe users authenticate with their own credentials at runtime instead of the default connection.

# Runtime user connections

Recipes perform actions based on the identity and permissions of the user who connects the application by default. Using **Runtime user connections**, users can use their own credentials when running a recipe, even if they didn't create the original application connection.

> **FEATURE AVAILABILITY**
> 
> The runtime user connections feature is included in specific pricing plans. Refer to your pricing plan and contract to learn more.

## How do runtime user connections work?

The **Runtime user connections** feature allows users to authenticate themselves when a recipe runs, allowing the recipe to execute actions using their own credentials.

For example: We have a recipe that uses Workbot to create opportunities in Salesforce. Here's what the execution looks like with and without runtime user connections:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A((<strong>User A</strong> invokes <br>recipe using <br>Workbot command)) --> B{Are runtime<br> user connections<br> enabled?}

    B -.-|Yes| C{{Workbot prompts <strong>User A</strong><br> for Salesforce credentials}}
    B -.-|No| F{{Workbot uses default recipe<br>connection established by<br> <strong>User B</strong>}}

    C -.- D[Workbot authenticates<br>with <strong>User A's</strong> credentials]
    F -.- G[Workbot authenticates with<br><strong>User B's</strong> credentials]

    D --> E[/Opportunities created<br>and credited to <strong>User A</strong>/]
    G --> H[/Opportunities created<br>and credited to <strong>User B</strong>/]

classDef LightTeal fill:#e1fffc,stroke:#67eadd,stroke-width:2px,color:#000;
classDef WorkatoBlue fill:#5159f6,stroke:#5159f6,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff;
class C,F WorkatoBlue
class G,H LightTeal
```

Connections persist after you create them. This means that users don't have to provide their credentials every time they run a recipe. Additionally, these connections can't be used in other recipes like normal connections.

## What are parent connections?

Connections created at runtime link to a parent connection.

For example, when you run a recipe with a Salesforce connection and authenticate to Salesforce, it creates Connection B. This new connection links to the recipe's default Salesforce connection, Connection A, as its parent.

```mermaid
graph LR
X(("&nbsp; Skill with<br>verified user access and a<br>Salesforce connection<br>is triggered")) --> Y{{"Runtime user access<br>prompts the user to<br> authenticate with existing<br> credentials or create<br>credentials"}}
A[/"Recipe default<br>connection <br/> or <strong> Parent connection </strong>"/]
A -.User connection  <br/> automatically<br>links to the Parent connection.- Z("A child connection <br/> is created for the<br>user")
Y --> Z

class Y WorkatoBlue
```

> **PARENT CONNECTIONS LIMITATION**
> 
> Parent connections are not supported for recipe functions toggled with runtime user connections. You must create separate runtime user connections for these recipes. If you try to use a parent connection, it fails and may cause unexpected behavior. We recommend creating a specific runtime user connection.

## Who can use runtime user connections?

This feature is available to all plans and account types, including Embedded. However, users need the following privileges to [enable or disable](#enabling-and-disabling-runtime-user-connections) the setting for recipes:

- **Edit recipes**
- **View Runtime user connections**
- **Edit Runtime user connections**

## Where can I use runtime user connections?

The **Runtime user connections** feature is available in:

- [Recipe functions](/en/connectors/recipe-functions)
- [Workbot recipes with a **New command** trigger](/en/workbot/overview)
- [Skills](/en/agentic/agent-studio/verified-user-access#add-verified-user-access-to-skill-recipes)
- [Eligible Workflow apps recipes](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/run-recipe)

* * *

## Enable and disable runtime user connections

When you add an action to an [eligible recipe](#where-can-i-use-runtime-user-connections), Workato prompts you to choose how connections are handled:

- **For Workbot, skill, and eligible Workflow apps recipes**: When adding actions like a Salesforce **Create record** action, you can choose whether the action uses:
  - The end user's credentials (runtime user connection)—your Workbot or genie prompts the user to authenticate
  - The default connection specified in the recipe

> **CONFIGURATION LOCATION CHANGE**
> 
> Runtime user connections are now configured directly in the recipe editor when selecting app connections, not in the recipe's **Settings** tab.

![Configure runtime user connections in Workbot recipes](/assets/workbot-runtime-user-connections.Bli_y4zl.png)_Configure runtime user connections in Workbot recipes_

- **For recipe functions**: When adding actions, you can choose whether to use:
  - The connection specified in the recipe function itself
  - The connection from the recipe that calls the function

## Manage runtime user connections

Manage runtime user connections in:

- [Apps](#managing-all-runtime-user-connections-in-app)
- [Workbot in Slack](#managing-runtime-user-connections-with-workbot-in-slack)
- [Workbot in Microsoft Teams](#managing-runtime-user-connections-with-workbot-in-microsoft-teams)

- [Workflow app recipes](/en/workflow-apps/verified-user-access#manage-run-time-user-connections)

### Manage all runtime user connections in-app

Manage runtime user connections by going to **Tools > Runtime user connections**. This page lists all connections created at runtime.

> **WHO CAN VIEW THIS PAGE?**
> 
> Users must have the **View Verified user access at runtime** privilege to access this page.

#### Delete a connection

Review the following information before you delete a connection:

- **Deleting a parent connection** causes recipes using the connection to stop. Child connections created at runtime aren't deleted.
  
- **Deleting a child connection** requires the user to re-authenticate themselves the next time the recipe runs. Successful re-authentication must occur before actions can be performed on their behalf.
  

Click the **Delete** link next to the connection to delete it.

> **WHO CAN DELETE CONNECTIONS?**
> 
> You must have the **Delete connections** privilege to delete connections.
