## Example: Uncompress a zip file

This recipe unzips a zip file and extracts the file contents.

![Uncompress file from S3](/assets/uncompress-file-recipe.BXrqHP0M.png)_Uncompress file from S3_

Complete the following steps to create this recipe:

1. Create a recipe using the Amazon S3 [New file](/en/connectors/s3/trigger-new-file) trigger.
   
2. Set a trigger condition that instructs the recipe to only process the new Amazon S3 file if it's a zip file.
   
3. Download the zip file using the Amazon S3 [Download file](/en/connectors/s3/action-download-file) action.
   
4. Map the Amazon S3 File content (Step 2) datapill to the **File contents** input field in the **Uncompress a file** action. ![Uncompress file input config](/assets/uncompress-file-recipe-input-config.Dm_4xUdi.png)
   
5. Add a **Repeat for each** step that processes every uncompressed file using the File list (Step 3) datapill from the **Uncompress a file** action.
   
6. Add an **IF condition** to only process extracted files ending in `.csv`.
   
7. Use the [Parse CSV](/en/features/handling-csv-files#csv-by-workato) action to parse the file contents if the IF condition is true.
   
8. Use the NetSuite [Upsert records in bulk](/en/connectors/netsuite/netsuite-upsert-batch-action) to bulk upsert the CSV file records into NetSuite.
   

The steps in the **Repeat for each** loop are repeated until all CSV files extracted from the zip file are processed.
