# Workato FileStorage

Workato FileStorage helps you store and make use of files within Workato. With Workato FileStorage, you can now do the following file operations with ease, all within Workato:

- Create and store data created in the recipes as files
- Get contents of a stored file and use the content in Workato recipes
- Append more content to an existing file
- Create directories to classify and store groups of files

You can use Workato FileStorage to effectively store files that must be processed in Workato recipes, and delete the files after the job completes successfully.

## Setup

Workato FileStorage supports both workspace-level and tenant-level access. There are two ways to access FileStorage system:

- [Through the FileStorage connector](#connector-access)
- [Through the FileStorage UI](#ui-access)

### FileStorage connector

The Workato FileStorage [connector](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-connector) does not restrict access based on role. All users in a workspace can access all FileStorage files and directories in the workspace using the connector.

There are no separate setup requirements in the connector, and you can use it directly to perform file-related operations.

### FileStorage UI

The Workato FileStorage [UI](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-console) restricts access based on role. See [Role-based access control in the FileStorage UI](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-console#rbac).

You can access Workato FileStorage through the Workato FileStorage connector in the recipe editor, or through the FileStorage UI in **Tools > FileStorage**.

The FileStorage UI allows you to browse the FileStorage system and perform certain file-related operations. No separate setup is required.

## Encryption

Workato FileStorage is built on an encrypted file storage system. In addition to this, each account's data is encrypted using an account specific key that rotates every month.

Additionally, Workato FileStorage is also included as part of Workato's [BYOK](/en/security/data-protection/encryption-key-management/#encryption-key-management) initiative.

* * *

## Data retention

Workato does not delete files available in FileStorage automatically and they are stored as long as the you wish to persist them in the system. If you want to delete this data you must do so manually using the FileStorage delete action.

* * *

## Storing sensitive data

Caution should be taken when storing sensitive data in Workato FileStorage, including personal data that would fall under privacy laws and regulations, financial data, and/or healthcare data. While Workato protects such data at rest and in transit through encryption, customers are responsible for assessing whether storage of such data is appropriate and allowable given their own policies and legal/regulatory requirements, as well as applying appropriate access controls.

## Things to know

- Streaming - A mechanism to transfer large files between two different entities by moving the files in smaller parts called chunks. This allows us to transfer large files without worrying about limitations in sending or receiving ends. All file adapters and bulk actions in Workato support streaming today and are capable of transferring large volumes of data. See [File Streaming](/en/features/file-streaming#file-streaming) for more information.
