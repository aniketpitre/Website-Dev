# File tools by Workato - Compress files action

The **Compress files** action allows you to compress multiple files into one zip or gzip file. You can use source files from any app, such as [Amazon S3](/en/connectors/s3), [Dropbox](/en/connectors/dropbox), and [Salesforce](/en/connectors/salesforce).

> **COMPATIBILITY**
> 
> Ensure all files have unique names, as this action doesn't support duplicates.
