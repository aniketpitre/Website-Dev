> Lookup tables let Workato recipes store, reference, and manage frequently used data in a table of entry rows and value columns, like a cross-reference.

# Lookup tables

Lookup tables enable recipes to efficiently store, reference, and manage frequently used data using a table of entry rows and value columns, similar to a cross-reference table.

The **Lookup tables** page enables you to manually create, delete, update, and parse tables.

The **Lookup tables by Workato** connector enables you to create recipes that add, update, delete, and retrieve information about entry rows, as well as delete tables.

> **FEATURE AVAILABILITY**
> 
> The Lookup tables feature is available to customers on specific pricing plans. Refer to your pricing plan and contract to learn more.
> 
> You must have one of the following to access the **Lookup tables** page:
> 
> - The [Lookup tables privilege](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/privileges-reference#environment-privileges).
> - The [**Environment admin**](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/system-environment-roles#environment-admin) or [**Environment manager**](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/system-environment-roles#environment-manager) role.
> - The legacy [**Admin** or **Analyst** system role](/en/roles#system-roles) in workspaces using the legacy permissions model.
> 
> Collaborators without access to the **Lookup tables** page can still interact with Lookup tables through the **Lookup tables by Workato** connector if the recipe is within the table's [scope](#assign-to-project).

## Usage inspiration

The following are examples of lookup table use cases:

- Look up zip codes using city names.
- Convert metric measurements to imperial for a downstream app.
- Create a cache for transient information such as business processes.
- Store frequently used static data to reduce API `GET` request costs.
- Store frequently used static data from slow or non-performant `GET` APIs.

> **INCOMPATIBLE USE CASES**
> 
> Lookup tables are not designed for the following use cases:
> 
> - **Relational database solution**: Lookup tables have enforced quotas, so they do not work as long-term, large relational databases.
> - **Large data in a single cell**: Do not store values larger than 10 kilobytes in a single lookup table cell.

## Lookup table quotas

Lookup tables have the following quotas:

| Description | Quota | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Maximum number of lookup tables in a workspace | 100 | NA |
| Maximum number of columns in a lookup table | 10 | NA |
| Maximum number of rows in a lookup table | 100,000 | The Lookup tables connector **Get all entries** action retrieves only the first 10,000 entries.; Tables with more than 50,000 entries can't be downloaded as a CSV file. |
| Maximum row size | 128 KB | NA |
| Maximum number of rows in a lookup table in Recipe lifecycle management imports and exports | 10,000 | NA |
| Maximum file size for a lookup table imported through Recipe lifecycle management | 10 MB | This quota applies independently of the row count quota. A lookup table can exceed 10 MB with fewer than 10,000 rows when rows contain large values. Imports that exceed this quota are blocked before the diff screen appears. |
| Maximum batch size in lookup table connector actions | 10,000 | This quota applies to the following connector actions: **Add entries (batch)** action, **Get all entries (batch)** action |

* * *

## Control Lookup table access

Control access to your workspace's Lookup tables using the following methods:

- [Modify collaborator roles](#role-permissions)
- [Scope Lookup tables](#assign-to-project) to specific projects

### Role-based access control for Lookup tables

You can use [role-based access control](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/#how-role-based-access-control-works) to manage access to the **Lookup tables** page.

Complete the following steps to modify a collaborator role's Lookup table privileges:

1. Go to **Workspace admin > Access control > Environment roles**.
   
2. Select the role you plan to modify or click **\+ Add environment role**.
   
3. Go to **Platform tools > Data storage**.
   
4. In the **Lookup tables** row, select the [privileges](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/privileges-reference#data-storage) to assign the role. ![Privileges for data storage](/assets/permissions-data-storage.B7iMMPfS.png)_Lookup table privileges_
   
5. Click **Save changes**. ![Save changes to role](/assets/save-changes-to-role._732gb6C.png)_Save changes to role_
   

> **SCOPE OF LOOKUP TABLE PRIVILEGES**
> 
> Role-based access control only manages access to the **Lookup tables** page. Collaborators can still interact with Lookup tables that are [scoped to projects they have access to](#assign-to-project) through the **Lookup tables by Workato** connector.

### Assign Lookup tables to specific projects

By default, Lookup tables are accessible from all projects. You can limit the scope to make a Lookup table accessible only within a specific project. Once scoped, the table is visible only to collaborators with [access to that project](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/access-control-v2#manage-project-access-and-roles).

Complete the following steps to restrict a Lookup table to a specific project:

1. Go to **Tools > Lookup tables**.
   
2. Select the Lookup table you plan to scope.
   
3. Click **Available in** to open the **Update availability** dialog. ![Update Lookup table scope](/assets/specify-table-scope.DZfRgv5M.png)_Update the scope of a Lookup table_
   
4. Use the **Choose a project** drop-down menu to restrict the Lookup table's access to a specific project.
   
5. Click **Update availability**.
   
6. Use [role-based project access](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/privileges-reference#project-privileges) to restrict which collaborators can access the project.
   

> **CHANGING SCOPE CAN AFFECT RUNNING RECIPES**
> 
> Changing the scope of a Lookup table can affect its availability within currently running recipes.

## Using formulas to look up entries

You can use the `lookup()` formula to perform the [Lookup entry action](#lookup-entry-action) within input fields.

The following template demonstrates how to use the formula:

```ruby
lookup("TABLE_NAME", "REFERENCE_COLUMN": datapill)["LOOKUP_COLUMN"]
```

In this template:

- `TABLE_NAME` is the name of the Lookup table where you plan to look up an entry.
- `REFERENCE_COLUMN` is the name of the column to search for matching values.
- `datapill` is the value the formula will search for in the `REFERENCE_COLUMN`.
- `LOOKUP_COLUMN` is the name of the column to return a value from in the row of the matching entry.

> **IN-MEMORY LOOKUP TABLES**
> 
> Use the **Entries** object, which contains the output of actions such as [**Search entries**](#search-entries-action-batch), in place of `TABLE_NAME` to create an in-memory Lookup table. The in-memory table searches entries more quickly and only searches the reduced list of entries obtained in the initial action. This can help save time when a recipe needs to call the lookup function on the same Lookup table thousands of times.

The following example uses the `Account IDs` table. It looks up the `Intacct account ID` of the first entry that matches the given `Salesforce account ID`:

```ruby
lookup("Account IDs", "Salesforce account ID": datapill)["Intacct account ID"]
```

To search multiple columns, enter additional reference columns within the parentheses and separate them with commas:

```ruby
lookup("TABLE_NAME", "REFERENCE_COLUMN": datapill, "REFERENCE_COLUMN_2": datapill2)["LOOKUP_COLUMN"]
```
