# Scheduler by Workato - New recurring event trigger

The **New recurring event** trigger allows you to define the interval at which your recipe runs.

For example, you can schedule your recipe to run every 15 minutes or at a specific time, such as 9:00 AM every Monday. To use a more advanced schedule, select **Custom schedule** from the **Time unit** drop-down menu and enter a cron expression. The minimum supported interval is five minutes.

> **RECIPE RESTART BEHAVIOR**
> 
> When a stopped recipe is restarted after its scheduled time has passed, it executes immediately.

> **TIMING IS APPROXIMATE**
> 
> Scheduled trigger times are approximate and may experience slight delays due to the trigger's processing queue design. For more precise scheduling, use a [cron expression](#cron-expressions).

## Input

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Time unit | Choose the interval for your schedule. Options include **Minutes**, **Hours**, **Days**, **Weeks**, **Months**, or **Custom schedule**. |
| Trigger every | Specify how often to run the recipe. Enter whole numbers only. The minimum value is `5` minutes. |
| Trigger at | **Available for Days, Weeks, and Months**. Define the specific time to run the job. |
| Days of the week | **Available for Weeks**. Select the days on which the schedule repeats. |
| Days of the month | **Available for Months**. Select the days on which the schedule repeats. |
| Cron expression | **Available for Custom schedule**. Enter a [cron expression](#cron-expressions) to define an advanced schedule. |
| Timezone | Select the timezone for your schedule. The default is **America/Los\_Angeles**. |
| Start after | Set the date and time to start the recipe. You can't change this value after the recipe has run or been tested. |

> **DST AND TIMEZONE BEHAVIOR**
> 
> When you set the **Timezone** to a named IANA zone (for example, `America/New_York`), Workato schedules jobs in that zone and automatically follows that zone's DST (Daylight Saving Time) rules. For example, a "9:00 AM every Monday" schedule fires at 9:00 AM EDT in summer and 9:00 AM EST in winter.

## Output

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Scheduled time | The time at which the recipe is scheduled to run. |
| Scheduled day | The day on which the recipe is scheduled to run. |
| Scheduled week | The week on which the recipe is scheduled to run. |
| Scheduled month | The month on which the recipe is scheduled to run. |
| Last job time | The time when the recipe last ran. |
| On demand | Indicates whether the recipe was triggered on demand by the [Force run a recipe](/en/workato-api/recipes#force-run-a-recipe) endpoint, instead of its normal schedule. |

> **SCHEDULED TIME OUTPUT**
> 
> The **Scheduled time** output field defaults to **(GMT-08:00) Pacific Time (US & Canada)**.
> 
> To use a different timezone, adjust the **Timezone** input field accordingly.

> **INDEXED DAY, WEEK, MONTH**
> 
> Output fields return a zero-based index of the current day, week, or month at the time the job triggers.

A cron expression defines a schedule for automated tasks using a fixed and ordered syntax. To set a custom schedule, select **Custom schedule** from the **Time unit** drop-down menu.

Cron expressions consist of five fields, each representing a specific time unit. Use the wildcard `*` to represent all possible values in a field. For more information, see [Cron expressions](https://crontab.guru/).

```plaintext
<Minute> <Hour> <Day of month> <Month> <Day of week>
```

### Examples

| Cron expression | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `0 0 * * *` | Every day at midnight (`00:00`). |
| `*/10 * * * *` | Every 10 minutes. |
| `0 0 1 * *` | The first day of every month at midnight (`00:00`). |
| `0 0 L * *` | The last day of every month at midnight (`00:00`). |
| `0 0 * * 1,5` | Every Monday and Friday at midnight (`00:00`). |
| `0,30 * * * *` | Twice every hour, at `00` and `30` minutes past. |
| `0 9 * * MON#1` | The first Monday of every month at `09:00`. |
