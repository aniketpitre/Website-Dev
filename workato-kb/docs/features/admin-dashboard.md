The **Operations hub dashboard** provides a real-time overview of your Workato recipes and connections. It offers key insights, analytics, and actionable items to help you resolve issues efficiently.

Use the Operations Hub dashboard to tie recipe jobs directly to business metrics. This allows you to track vital data such as the daily addition of new customers to a CRM system or the monthly processing of invoices. This visibility into trends over time helps you identify outliers that could impact business operations.

## Dashboard sections

Each section is designed to deliver key operational metrics, giving you a comprehensive 360° view of the recipes in your workspace.
