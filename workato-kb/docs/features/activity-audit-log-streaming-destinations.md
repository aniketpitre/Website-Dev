> Configure audit log streaming destinations in Workato, including Amazon S3, Azure Monitor, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage.

# Audit log streaming destinations

Before you begin, refer to our [set up audit log streaming](/en/features/activity-audit-log-streaming) guide for instructions on enabling audit log streaming in your workspace.

Workato supports cloud connections to the following audit log streaming destinations:

- [Amazon S3 Bucket](#amazon-s3-bucket)
- [Azure Monitor](#azure-monitor)
- [Azure Blob Storage](#azure-blob-storage)
- [Cloud based logging services](#cloud-based-logging-services)
- [Google Cloud Storage Bucket](#google-cloud-storage-buckets)

## Amazon S3 Bucket

To stream your audit logs to Amazon S3, select an existing Amazon S3 connection or create one that has a region and bucket set up. This connection must be assigned an IAM role with the following policy permissions:

- `ListAllMyBuckets`: This list permission allows Workato to list all buckets belonging to your S3 account. This permission is required even if your connection is restricted to one bucket within S3.
- `PutObject`: This write permission allows Workato to stream your activity audit logs to the bucket you specify during setup.

![Minimum S3 permissions for ALS](/assets/als-s3-permissions-policy.CbZqLwlp.png)_Minimum permissions for audit log streaming to S3_

To ensure the audit logs are streamed successfully, confirm that your Amazon S3 connection meets the following requirements:

- The specified S3 bucket must exist.
- The region specified in the S3 connection must match the region of the selected bucket.
- The IAM role ARN (Amazon Resource Name) associated with the S3 connection must be valid.
- The IAM role must have the `ListAllMyBuckets` and `PutObject` permissions.
- Use a cloud connection, not an [on-prem connection](/en/on-prem/agents).
- Allowlist Workato's [data center IP addresses](/en/security/ip-allowlists) if you use an IP allowlist to secure your storage.

Learn more about setting up an IAM role and permissions policy in our [IAM role-based authentication](/en/security/data-protection/secrets-management/iam-role-based-authentication-for-aws) documentation.

> **IAM ROLE PERMISSIONS**
> 
> When you update your IAM role bucket permissions, you must disconnect and re-establish your S3 connection in Workato before you can continue using S3 as a streaming destination. This is a security feature designed to help you manage secure access to your resources.
> 
> Additionally, if you plan to restrict access to a specific bucket within S3, you must configure this setting when you [set up your S3 connection](/en/connectors/s3#connection-setup).
> 
> The IAM role must be configured at the bucket level and _not_ at the `bucket/object` level.

## Azure Monitor

Complete the following steps to stream your audit logs to Azure Monitor:

> **SHARED KEY DEPRECATED**
> 
> Shared key authentication method uses the legacy [HTTP Data Collector API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-collector-api), which is deprecated and will stop working in September 2026. Migrate to client credentials authentication instead.

1. Use the **Audit log destination** drop-down menu to select **Azure Monitor**.
   
2. Click **Set up connection**.
   
3. **Client credentials authentication**
   
   1. Select an existing connection or refer to the [Azure Monitor](/en/connectors/azure_monitor) guide to create a new connection.

## Azure Blob Storage

Select an Azure Blob connection that has containers set up. The connection should have read/write access to the containers. Reference our [Azure blob documentation](/en/connectors/azure_blob_storage#create-an-auth-code-grant-isu) to learn how to change role access of the Integration System User (ISU) in Microsoft Entra ID. Azure charges [additional fees](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/blobs/#pricing) for every 10,000 logs streamed to Azure Blob.

> **CONNECTION REQUIREMENTS**
> 
> Ensure the connection to Azure Blob Storage meets the following requirements:
> 
> - Use a cloud connection, not an [on-prem connection](/en/on-prem/agents).
> - Allowlist Workato's [data center IP addresses](/en/security/ip-allowlists) if you use an IP allowlist to secure your storage.

## Cloud based logging services

You can use any log service provider (such as Sumo Logic, Datadog, or Splunk) as a streaming destination. Learn more about configuring an HTTP based log collection using [Sumo Logic](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Sources/02Sources-for-Hosted-Collectors/HTTP-Source) or [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/?tab=httpussite).

### How to use a cloud based logging service destination

Go to the **Destination URL** field and enter the HTTP URL from your cloud-based logging service provider. Workato audit log streaming posts the audit log events in real-time to this URL.

If your log service provider requires authentication to send HTTP requests, enable the **Requires authentication** slider, then select the **Link your account** button to specify an HTTP connection with your authentication information. You can create a new HTTP connection or link to an existing connection.

![Link an HTTP connection](/assets/link-your-account.BPurmmNo.png)_Link to an HTTP connection_

> **SUPPORTED AUTHENTICATION METHODS FOR HTTP CONNECTIONS**
> 
> When setting up the HTTP connector for log streaming, ensure that you use one of the following authentication methods:
> 
> - Basic
> - Query
> - `oauth2_auth_code_grant`
> - `oauth2_client_credentials_grant`
> - Custom
> 
> Note that audit log streaming to REST-based destinations is only compatible with the preceding listed authentication methods. You will not be able to successfully configure streaming if you use another authentication method.

### Troubleshooting

Complete the following steps to troubleshoot your log streaming:

1. Go to [https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/)
   
2. Find and authorize **Cloud Logging API v2**.
   
3. Sign in using the user account credentials for your Google Cloud Bucket. This automatically generates an access token.
   
4. Configure the `POST` request with the following message format, replacing the names with your GCP instance values:
   
   ```json
   
   {
   
     "logName" : "projects/your-project-name/logs/your-log-name",
   
     "resource": { "type": "gce_instance"},
   
    "entries": [
   
     {
   
      "jsonPayload": {
   
       "data": "hello world"
   
      }
   
     }
   
    ]
   
   }
   ```
   
5. Go to Google Logs Explorer and run a query to check for `logName = {your-log-name}`, replacing the values with the GCP information you configured.
   
   > **LOG MISSING**
   > 
   > If you do not see a log, the `POST` request may have failed. Check the error response code in your `POST` request to view the exact error. If you receive a permissions error, check that your user account has the required permissions.
   

> **ADDITIONAL TROUBLESHOOTING**
> 
> Ensure the connection to your streaming destination meets the following requirements:
> 
> - Use a cloud connection, not an [on-prem connection](/en/on-prem/agents).
> - Allowlist Workato's [data center IP addresses](/en/security/ip-allowlists) if you use an IP allowlist to secure your storage.
