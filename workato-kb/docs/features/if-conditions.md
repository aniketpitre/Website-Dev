> Learn how IF control statements add branching logic to Workato recipes using IF, ELSE IF, and ELSE conditions to direct recipe execution.

# IF control statement

An **IF** control statement provides logic branching in your Workato recipes, directing your recipe's execution based on specified conditions. This section explores how to manage conditional logic effectively and highlights the flow of conditional branches.

## Manage conditional logic with IF control statements

The **IF** control statement evaluates each branch in sequence, stopping once a condition is met:

- **IF**: The initial condition is evaluated first.
- **ELSE IF**: If the **IF** condition is false, this condition is evaluated. Multiple **ELSE IF** conditions can be chained.
- **ELSE**: If no previous conditions are met, this branch executes.

This flow ensures that only one branch executes, avoiding overlapping or unintended behaviors.

### Overlapping conditions

Creating overlapping conditions may lead to multiple logic blocks executing simultaneously, resulting in unexpected behavior. The **IF-ELSE IF** structure ensures only one block of logic executes, preventing overlapping executions.

### Revising conditions

Inserting or removing conditions previously required significant restructuring of the IF-ELSE logic, potentially leading to errors. **IF** control statements allow you to add or remove conditions smoothly, maintaining the integrity of your recipe.

### Improving readability

Nested **IF** conditions do not necessarily slow down recipes, but they can make them difficult to read and manage. **IF-ELSE IF** structures make your recipes cleaner, easier to debug, and more manageable, avoiding the pitfalls of deeply nested conditions.
