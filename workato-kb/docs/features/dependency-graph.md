> Use the Workato dependency graph to visualize relationships between workspace assets and analyze the impact of upstream and downstream changes.

# Dependency graph

The **Dependency graph** visualizes the relationships between assets in your workspace. You can use this feature to analyze dependencies and the potential impact of asset changes.

Refer to the following sections for more information about using the Dependency graph to view upstream and downstream dependencies in your workspace:

- [Access the Dependency graph](#accessing-graph)
- [Navigation features](#viewing-features)
- [Supported assets](#supported-assets)

## Supported assets

Select an asset type from the **Asset** drop-down menu to view its dependencies:

- **[Apps](/en/connectors)**: Shows how recipes use various apps. By default, the graph displays all apps in **Active** recipes. You can display inactive recipes using the **Recipe status** filter.

Apps

You can use the **Apps** view to determine:

- **Which apps your team is integrating or automating**: The Apps Dependency graph only includes apps with at least one connection.
  
- **The flows you're creating for a single app**: Click an app to view its overview, which displays the app's individual connections, the recipes that use each connection, and more.
  
- **Which apps are most highly used**: The number below each app icon indicates how many recipes use the app.
  
- **How your team uses apps together**: Connecting lines show which apps are used together in recipes. When you hover over an app, the lines display a number indicating how many recipes use both apps together.
  

For example, the following Box app is used in 3 recipes total, including 2 recipes that also use Salesforce:
