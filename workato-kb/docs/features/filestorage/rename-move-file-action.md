> **FILE AND DIRECTORY ACCESS**
> 
> Currently, all users in a workspace can access all FileStorage files and directories in the workspace when they use the [FileStorage connector](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-connector). Workato does not restrict access based on role unless the files are accessed from the [FileStorage UI](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-console#rbac).

## Input
