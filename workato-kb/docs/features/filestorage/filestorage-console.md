### Move files

Within the FileStorage UI, you can move files to other directories in the FileStorage UI.

To move a file:

1. In the FileStorage UI, navigate to the directory that the file is in.
   
2. Select the three dots in the far right of each file or directory.
   
   ![Three dots selected for the file sales-leads.txt](/assets/filestorage-ui-dots-select.CINPijes.png)_Selecting the three dots for a file_
   
3. Select **Move**. This opens the **Move file** modal.
   

In the **Move file** modal, there are two ways you can move a file to another directory. You can either use the **Choose a directory** method, or the **Enter a directory path** method. To use **Choose a directory**, you select the directory path from a drop-down menu. To use **Enter a directory path**, you enter the directory path directly.

To use **Choose a directory**:

1. In the **Move file** modal, using the left drop-down, make sure that you've selected the drop-down option **Choose a directory**.
   
2. Select the vertical triangle next to the name of the directory the file is. This opens a drop-down list of all the subdirectories within the current directory. If the directory you'd like to move the file to is not listed in the list of subdirectories after selecting the vertical triangle, continue to expand the subdirectories using the vertical triangle until you see the subdirectory you'd like to move the file to.
   
   ![Expanding the drop-down list of subdirectories to find a directory](/assets/filestorage-ui-subdirectory-list.CZSS424V.png)_Finding the directory you'd like to move the file to_
   
3. From the drop-down list of subdirectories, select the name of the directory you want to move your file to.
   
   ![Selecting the correct directory](/assets/filestorage-ui-select-directory.CIIst0qc.png)_The directory is selected within the drop-down list_
   
4. Select the **Confirm** button.
   

To use **Enter a directory path**:

1. In the **Move file** modal, using the left drop-down, select the drop-down option **Enter a directory path**.
   
2. Enter the path of the subdirectory you want to move the file to. Directory paths in the FileStorage UI take the format of `/Directory_Name`. If you are moving a file to a nested subdirectory, the format for the path is `/Directory_Name/Subdirectory_Name`. The path for the root directory is `/`.
   
   ![Entering the directory path of the subdirectory you'd like to move the file to](/assets/filestorage-ui-directory-path.Dq2ek2KP.png)_Entering the path of a subdirectory_
   
3. Select the **Confirm** button.
   

> **CONFIRM NEW DIRECTORY**
> 
> After you move a file, a green popup displays at the top of the UI. This popup confirms the file was moved successfully. When you select the **Show file location** link in the popup, the link redirects to the file's new directory.

### Browse files and directories

The FileStorage UI displays the FileStorage system's root directory by default. From the root directory, you can view a list of files and subdirectories, select a file to preview, select a subdirectory to browse, or create a directory.

![Browsing files and directories in the Workato FileStorage UI](/assets/filestorage-ui-browse.CDyFaCHp.png)_Browsing files and directories in the Workato FileStorage UI_

The UI displays the following information for each file in the list:

- Name
- Type
- Size
- Status
- Created time
- Last modified time

The UI displays the following information for each directory in the list:

- Name
- Type
- Created time

You can sort by **Name** or **Created time** by selecting the appropriate column name. Select it again to reverse the sort direction.

* * *

### Search files and directories

You can recursively search both files and directories using FileStorage UI. To search only files or only directories, select the **All types** drop-down menu and choose the desired type.

The search function is case insensitive. For example, the search terms `contacts` and `CONTACTS` return the same files.

![Searching FileStorage by all types, just files, or just directories](/assets/filestorage-ui-search-all-types.B2o0cxFB.png)_Searching FileStorage by files only, directories only, or both_

* * *

### Preview a file and its metadata

When you select a file from the list of files and directories, the FileStorage UI opens a side panel displaying the file's metadata. For CSV files, the panel also displays a preview of the file's contents.

![Previewing a file in the FileStorage UI](/assets/filestorage-ui-preview.BmpeelA8.png)_Previewing a file in the FileStorage UI_

The UI displays the following metadata for the selected file:

- Type
- Size
- Path (select **Copy** to copy the file path)
- Scan status
- Last scanned
- Created
- Last modified

When you select a CSV file, the preview displays up to the first 10 rows of the CSV.

Select the **Fullscreen** button to view a fullscreen preview of the file. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Command + Enter (Mac) or Ctrl + Enter (Windows).

Select **Exit** or use the keyboard shortcut Esc to return to the default preview.

* * *

### Delete, move, download, and rename files from preview

When you select a file from the list of files and directories, the FileStorage UI opens a side panel displaying the file's metadata. Within this side panel, you can delete, move, download, and rename the file.

![Previewing a file in the FileStorage UI](/assets/filestorage-ui-preview.BmpeelA8.png)_Previewing a file in the FileStorage UI_

To delete or move a file from preview:

1. Select the three dots at the top right of the side panel.
   
   ![Select the three dots at the top of the side panel](/assets/filestorage-ui-preview-options.CRMSRLAH.png)_When you select the dots, a drop-down menu opens with the options to Move file or Delete file_
   
2. From the drop-down menu, select either **Move file** or **Delete file**. For detailed instructions on how to use these options, see [Move file](#move) or [Delete file](#delete).
   

To download a file from preview, select the **Download** button in the upper-right corner of the side panel.

To rename a file from preview, select the pencil icon next to the file's name. After you enter a new name in the input field, select the checkmark icon.

### Virus scanning support

FileStorage automatically scans uploaded files for viruses in the background. This helps protect your workflows and ensures uploaded files are safe. You don't need to trigger scans manually. FileStorage schedules and runs them based on the file's size and type.

#### Scan status

Each file includes a scan **Status** field, which displays whether the system has scanned the file for viruses. This data appears in the file list and in the file preview panel.

![FileStorage root directory](/assets/fs-root-directory.4y34wF2x.png)_FileStorage root directory_

FileStorage assigns one of the following scan statuses to each file:

**Not scanned status**

The file doesn't require scanning

![FileStorage root directory](/assets/not-scanned-status.TBsCLsU8.png)_Not scanned status_

**Scanned status**

The system completed the scan and found no issues.

![FileStorage root directory](/assets/scanned-status.Bx3jpp3x.png)_Scanned status_

**Unable to scan status**

The file exceeds scan quotas or encountered a scan error.

![FileStorage root directory](/assets/unable-scan-status.Udy32Iy-.png)_Unable to scan status_

**Malicious status**

The system flagged the file as harmful. The FileStorage UI blocks the file preview and displays a warning before download. You can delete the file permanently.

![FileStorage root directory](/assets/malicious-status.ClujOTvE.png)_Malicious status_

Workato displays a warning before you download files with the **Not scanned**, **Unable to scan**, or **Malicious** status. The alert displays the scan status and informs the user of potential risks.

#### Scan preview

The file preview panel displays the scan status with the file's metadata. When a file has the **Not scanned**, **Unable to scan**, or **Malicious** status, the file preview is blocked. Refer to the [Preview a file and its metadata](#preview) section for more information on preview behavior.

#### Scan quotas

FileStorage scans files up to **100 MB**. Files that exceed this quota are marked as **Unable to scan** and display a warning before you download them.

#### Malicious files

FileStorage marks files as **Malicious** when the scan detects threats. The FileStorage UI blocks the file preview and displays a warning before you download the file. Workato doesn't prevent recipes from processing files marked as **Malicious**, and doesn't delete these files automatically. Review scan statuses in the FileStorage UI and delete malicious files to prevent recipes from processing them.

## Role-based access control in the FileStorage UI

Workato restricts access to the FileStorage UI using [role-based access control](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/). This is in contrast to the [FileStorage connector](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-connector), where all users in a workspace can access all FileStorage files and directories in the workspace.

To view or edit the permissions for a role, navigate to **Workspace admin > Access control > Collaborator roles**. Select the desired role, and then select **Platform tools**.

The following permissions are available in the FileStorage UI:

- Full access
  
- View and create files and directories
  
- View
  
- View files and directories
  
- Create
  
- Create files and directories
  

System and custom roles have the following permissions:

- **Environment admin** and **Environment manager** roles
  
- All permissions enabled
  
- **Member** role
  
- No permissions enabled
  
- Legacy **Admin** and **Analyst** system roles
  
- All permissions enabled
  
- Legacy **Operator** system role
  
- No permissions enabled
  
- Custom roles
  
- No permissions enabled by default; any permission can be assigned
