# Workato FileStorage - Generate shareable file link action

This action allows you to create a temporary authenticated URL that you can share externally for a file in [Workato FileStorage](/en/features/workato-filestorage). A third party can use this URL to download, upload, or append contents to the file for a duration you specify.

> **FILE AND DIRECTORY ACCESS**
> 
> Currently, all users in a workspace can access all FileStorage files and directories in the workspace when they use the [FileStorage connector](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-connector). Workato does not restrict access based on role unless the files are accessed from the [FileStorage UI](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-console#rbac).
