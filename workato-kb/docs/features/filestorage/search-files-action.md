> Use the Search files action to find files matching a name condition across directories and subdirectories in Workato FileStorage.

# Workato FileStorage - Search files action

This action searches directories and subdirectories in [Workato FileStorage](/en/features/workato-filestorage) and returns a list of files with names that match a specified condition. This is useful for grouping and processing files. The action supports pagination to retrieve large lists of files.

If you select a directory but do not specify a condition to match, the action lists all files under a directory and its subdirectories.

> **FILE AND DIRECTORY ACCESS**
> 
> Currently, all users in a workspace can access all FileStorage files and directories in the workspace when they use the [FileStorage connector](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-connector). Workato does not restrict access based on role unless the files are accessed from the [FileStorage UI](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-console#rbac).
