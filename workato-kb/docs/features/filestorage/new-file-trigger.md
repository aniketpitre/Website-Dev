# Workato FileStorage - New file trigger (real-time)

This trigger is initiated immediately, in real time, when a new file is created or uploaded to a specified directory in [Workato FileStorage](/en/features/workato-filestorage). The trigger can be paired with both streaming and non-streaming actions (for small volume data).

> **FILE AND DIRECTORY ACCESS**
> 
> Currently, all users in a workspace can access all FileStorage files and directories in the workspace when they use the [FileStorage connector](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-connector). Workato does not restrict access based on role unless the files are accessed from the [FileStorage UI](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-console#rbac).
