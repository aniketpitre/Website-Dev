# Workato FileStorage - Create directory action

This action creates a new directory in [Workato FileStorage](/en/features/workato-filestorage). Directories are useful for grouping similar files. For example, you could group all marketing files under one directory called `marketing` or store all August sales data files within the directory path `sales/august`.

> **FILE AND DIRECTORY ACCESS**
> 
> Currently, all users in a workspace can access all FileStorage files and directories in the workspace when they use the [FileStorage connector](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-connector). Workato does not restrict access based on role unless the files are accessed from the [FileStorage UI](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-console#rbac).
