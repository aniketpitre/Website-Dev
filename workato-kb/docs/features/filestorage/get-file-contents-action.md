# Workato FileStorage - Get file contents action

This action returns the contents of a file stored in [Workato FileStorage](/en/features/workato-filestorage). Like the [Create file](/en/features/filestorage/create-file-action) and [Append file](/en/features/filestorage/append-to-file-action) actions, you can pair this action with streaming or non-streaming upload and bulk actions.

> **FILE AND DIRECTORY ACCESS**
> 
> Currently, all users in a workspace can access all FileStorage files and directories in the workspace when they use the [FileStorage connector](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-connector). Workato does not restrict access based on role unless the files are accessed from the [FileStorage UI](/en/features/filestorage/filestorage-console#rbac).
