## Limitations and compatibility

The **Get file from URL** action behaves differently based on the file size and whether file streaming is enabled. Understanding these differences helps you choose the right configuration for your source system.

### How the action handles files

The **Get file from URL** action retrieves the entire file in memory before uploading the file to Workato when streaming is disabled. The disabled streaming mode supports a maximum 200 MB file size and is a recommended option when the source URL responds with a complete file in one response.

The **Get file from URL** action downloads the file in chunks to reduce memory usage when streaming is enabled. The streaming enabled mode is designed for large files and supports a maximum file size of approximately 2 GB. The source system must support HTTP range requests or chunked transfer encoding. The download may fail, repeat, or return incomplete data if the source doesn't support HTTP range requests or chunked transfer encoding methods.

### Compatibility with different sources

Not all file servers or APIs support streaming. For example, some endpoints return the full file in one response and reject range or chunked requests.

The **Get file from URL** action fails when connecting to non-streaming sources if you enable **Enable file streaming?**.

Disable **Enable file streaming?** in the action settings if your file source doesn't support streaming. Alternatively, use the HTTP connector to make a standard GET request and handle the file in your recipe.

### File size quotas

The following quotas apply to the **Get file from URL** action:

- **Maximum 200 MB**: Supported in non-streaming mode.
- **Maximum 2 GB**: Supported in streaming mode if the source supports range or chunked requests.
