> Build your first Workbot for Slack recipe using the New command trigger to run app actions and post replies in a Slack channel.

# Build your first Workbot

One of the most common ways to interact with Workbot is through the use of a command. When you enter a command into a Slack channel, such as `Mailchimp add subscriber`, Workbot triggers a recipe that performs a specific action in an app and returns data to the Slack channel. For example, it adds a subscriber to a list in Mailchimp and returns a confirmation message.

The recipe of a command is comprised of the **New command** trigger, actions to send or retrieve data from other apps, and the **Post reply** action.

This page and the subsequent page guide you through building a Workbot that creates a new issue in Github and posts a notification with the issue details in the Slack channel. A user triggers Workbot to run this recipe by sending the message `Create a Github issue` to Workbot.

This is the recipe you will build: [Create an issue in Github](https://www.workato.com/recipes/663926-create-an-issue-on-github-from-slack-using-workbot#recipe).

## Before you start

- If you have not already done so, [set up Workbot](/en/workbot/workbot-for-slack-setup) before proceeding to the section below
- Set up a connection to GitHub

## Step 1: Configure the New command trigger

1. Create a new recipe that is triggered from an app.
2. Click to add the trigger. Select **Workbot for Slack** > **New Command**.
3. Select the connection that you have established.
4. Configure the following fields:
   - **App**: Select `GitHub`
   - **Action**: Select `Create`
   - **Action data**: Select `Issue`

In addition to configuring the trigger, the values that you provided in step 4 (`GitHub Create Issue`) make up the command for triggering this recipe. Since Workbot has built-in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities, Workbot is flexible with how you phrase the command. You can enter the values in the sequence that is most natural to you, such as `create an issue in Github`.

5. Configure the command input fields. When Workbot runs, it will prompt the user for information necessary to run the recipe.  
   Click **Add command input** to create these three input fields:
   - **Name**: `Issue`, **Data type**: String, **Optional**: No
   - **Name**: `Description`, **Data type**: String, **Optional**: No
   - **Name**: `Assignee`, **Data type**: String, **Optional**: No

## Next

To enable Workbot to create the issue in Github, you must configure a **GitHub** > **Create issue** action. Map the Issue (Step 1), Description (Step 1), and Assignee (Step 1) datapills to their respective fields in the **Create issue** action. Refer to the following screenshot:

After you configure the GitHub action, proceed to [create a command reply](/en/workbot/workbot-command-reply).
