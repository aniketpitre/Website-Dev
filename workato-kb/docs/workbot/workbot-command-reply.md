# Creating a Command Reply

Use either the **Post command reply** or **Post message** action to respond to the user on Slack. You can configure Workbot to return data that was queried by the command or to respond to the user with a message confirming whether the command was successful or not. See the graphic below for an example use case.

This page guides you through the second part of building your first Workbot - [create an issue in Github](https://www.workato.com/recipes/663926-create-an-issue-on-github-from-slack-using-workbot#recipe). If you have not already done so, follow the steps in [configure the New command trigger](/en/workbot/workbot-commands#step-1-configure-the-new-command-trigger).

## Step two: Configure the Post command reply action

In the following steps, you configure the **Post command reply** action with datapills from the GitHub action output.

1. Under the Github action, click to add a new action. Select **Workbot for Slack** > **Post command reply**.
2. Select the connection that you have established.
3. In the **Message text** field, enter the message that Workbot will use in its reply: Issue `Number` created  
   Use the Number (Step 2)
4. Expand the **Message attachment** options and configure these fields with the following text and datapills:
   - **Title**: _Name of issue_ Title (Step 2)
   - **Title link**: URL (Step 2)
   - **Attachment text**: _Description_ Body (Step 2)  
     _Assignee_ Username
   - **Attachment color**: Select **Good**  
     This sets the vertical bar to the left of the message to green.
5. Click **Save**.

This is how the **Message attachment** fields should look: ![Message attachment with expanded fields](/assets/message-format-expanded-with-fields-1.BYSH1VMg.png)

This is how the message will appear to users in Slack: ![Command reply explained](/assets/command-reply-explained-1.Dgj94i0V.png)

## Test the command

To test the command, start the recipe and open the Slack workspace in which Workbot is installed.

1. In Slack, send a direct message to Workbot, and enter `github create issue`.  
   Workbot responds with `Enter issue:` as demonstrated in the screenshot below: ![Github create issue](/assets/github-create-issue-1.B8np6GDs.png)
2. Enter the issue title.  
   Workbot responds with `Enter description` as demonstrated in the screenshot below: ![Github enter description](/assets/github-enter-description-1.OekukpPl.png)
3. Enter the description of the issue.  
   Workbot responds with `Enter assignee:`![Github enter assignee](/assets/github-enter-assignee-1.BtOfNNmy.png)
4. Enter your name.  
   Workbot takes the information you provided, creates a new issue in Github, and returns a confirmation message. See the screenshot below for an example confirmation message: ![Github command reply](/assets/github-command-reply-1.BHb959OQ.png)

## Next

You can make the command reply more interactive by including [attachment fields](/en/connectors/slack#example-message-with-attachment), [images](/en/connectors/slack#example-message-with-attachment), [buttons](/en/connectors/slack#using-slack-message-buttons), and message menus.
