# Set up Workbot for Slack

Watch our 2 minute video guide instead

This guide demonstrates how to set up a standard Workbot for Slack connection.

> **STANDARD WORKBOT CONNECTION LIMIT**
> 
> Only one standard Workbot connection per Slack workspace is supported. Use [Enterprise Workbot](/en/workbot/workbot-custom-bots) instead if you need multiple Workbots in the same workspace. Enterprise Workbot requires a custom OAuth profile.

Complete the following steps to set up Workbot for Slack:

- [Step 1: Connect to the NLU provider](#_1-connect-to-the-nlu-provider) if you plan to use an NLU provider for the Workbot conversational interface. Otherwise, skip this step.
- [Step 2: Configure a custom OAuth profile](#_2-configure-a-custom-oauth-profile) if you plan to set up an Enterprise Workbot. Otherwise, skip this step.
- [Step 3: Create a Workbot for Slack connection](#_3-create-a-workbot-for-slack-connection)
- [Step 4: Invite Workbot to channels](#_4-invite-workbot-to-channels)

## Prerequisites

You must complete the following prerequisites before you set up Workbot for Slack:

- Confirm or obtain privileges to connect Workbot to Slack. Some organizations allow all members of a Slack workspace to install third-party apps, while other organizations restrict this privilege to admins only.
- Confirm that your organization uses an [integration user](/en/connections#creating-a-dedicated-user-for-workato) account to configure the connection. This prevents disruptions if a human user’s account permissions change.

> **ENTERPRISE GRID REQUIREMENT**
> 
> If your organization uses Slack Enterprise Grid, you must set up Enterprise Workbot. The standard Workbot isn't compatible with Enterprise Grid environments. Refer to the [Set up Enterprise Workbot with Slack Enterprise Grid](/en/workbot/guides/setup-workbot-for-slack-enterprise-grid#setup-requirements) guide for more information.

## 1\. Connect to the NLU provider

Workbot for Slack supports Google DialogFlow and Amazon Lex. If you would like to use one of these NLU providers, you must connect the NLU provider to Workato before you connect with Workbot for Slack.

To connect to your NLU provider, go to **App Connections** and select **Create a new connection**. Search for your NLU provider.

## 2\. Configure a custom OAuth profile

You can customize the Workbot for Slack identity, including the branding (bot name, bot logo, and background color) and permissions with a custom OAuth profile. Go to **Tools > Custom OAuth profiles > Create custom profile** to configure a new custom OAuth profile.

1. In the **Application** field, select **Workbot for Slack**. Click **Create new app**.
   
   This will open [your Slack apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) in a new tab.
   
2. Select **Create new app** from the Slack window.
   
3. Select **From scratch**. This allows you to define the scope and permission according to your use case.

## 3\. Create a Workbot for Slack connection

Connecting a Workbot for Slack connection will add Workbot to your Slack team. To create a new Workbot for Slack connection, go to **App Connections** and click **Create a new connection**. Search for **Workbot for Slack** to begin.

| Workbot for Slack connection fields |
| --- |
| Application | Workbot for Slack |
| Connection name | Choose an appropriate name for this connection |
| NLU provider | You can optionally select the DialogFlow or Amazon Lex NLU. You must connect to the NLU provider for it to appear in the drop-down list. |
| Advanced | Slash commands verification tokens | Used for invoking legacy Custom Integration slash commands. Each slash command has a token. Separate tokens with commas to support multiple slash commands. [Learn more.](https://docs.workato.com/workbot/legacy-slash-commands.html#configuring-the-workbot-connection) |
| Custom help | Provide simple text help OR rich help using a JSON document corresponding to Slack message. You can build a rich help message using the [Slack message builder](https://api.slack.com/docs/messages/builder). |
| Is this a Classic Slack app? | Select **Yes** if you have not migrated your app yet. |
| Custom OAuth profile | Custom OAuth profiles allow your Slack apps to leverage the Workato Slack connector under the hood. When selected, all requests to the app will use the profile specified. [Learn more](https://docs.workato.com/workbot/workbot-custom-bots.html). |

After you install Workbot into your Slack team, Workbot detects the latest app connections in your Workato account and automatically connects to them.

You can interact with Workbot via direct messages after adding Workbot to your Slack organization. Direct messages with Workbot are not visible to anyone but you.

To enable other users to interact with Workbot or to allow Workbot to post notifications, you must invite it to specific channels. Proceed to the next section.

"Slack team already has Workbot installed" error

The **Slack team already has Workbot installed** error means another standard Workbot for Slack connection is already active in your workspace. Only one standard Workbot for Slack connection per workspace is supported.

![Duplicate Workbot connection error](/assets/duplicate-workbot-connection-error.BKUXF_aL.png)_Duplicate Workbot connection error_

Perform one of the following actions to resolve this:

- Contact the user listed in the error and ask them to remove the existing Workbot connection from the workspace.
- Connect to a different Slack workspace.
- Use [Enterprise Workbot](/en/workbot/workbot-custom-bots) to run multiple Workbots in the same Slack workspace.

## 4\. Invite Workbot to channels

To invite Workbot to a channel, do one of the following:

- Mention Workbot via `@workbot` ![Invite Workbot to channels via mention](/assets/invite-workbot-to-channels-via-mention.DlvzoTme.png)
- Use the **Invite new members to join** menu option in the channel details ![Invite Workbot to channels via the menu option](/assets/invite-workbot-via-menu-option.BXTr6Kwa.gif)

After you add Workbot to a channel, use `@workbot` to begin an interaction.

> **WORKBOT VISIBILITY**
> 
> Conversations with Workbot in a channel are visible to all team members in that channel.

  

> **NOT REQUIRED FOR ENTERPRISE WORKBOT USERS**
> 
> You don't need to invite Workbot to your channels if you're using Enterprise Workbot.

  

> **DIRECT MESSAGING**
> 
> When you send a direct message to Workbot, you don't need to use `@workbot`.

## Next

Now that you have set up Workbot in Slack, proceed to [build your first Workbot](/en/workbot/workbot-commands).
