### Read request timeout limits

View read request timeout limits

The read request timeout limit is the number of seconds the client (gateway) waits for the server to respond. A read timeout occurs when the connection is established and the request is sent, but the server doesn't send a response before the timeout limit is reached. This prevents the request from being read.

Sorting and filtering is supported for only the first 756 characters. | `A long description or comment that can span many lines…` |
| Integer | Whole numbers without any fractional or decimal parts. Integers can represent both positive and negative values, including zero. | Integers are 64-bit (8-byte) and can range between `-9223372036854775808` and `9223372036854775807`. | `5000`, `100000`, `2147483647` |
| Decimal | IEEE-754 floating-point numbers. Commonly used for precise calculations involving fractional numbers, such as percentages or scientific measurements. | Floating-point numbers do not enforce a fixed number of decimal places. Precision is determined by the number’s range. For example, smaller values can represent more decimal places accurately, while larger values lose precision due to spacing between representable values. | `0.1`, `3.141592653589793`, `1.7976931348623157 × 10³⁰⁸` |
| Boolean | A true/false value. | NA | `TRUE`, `FALSE` |
| Date | Calendar dates (such as, year, month, and day) without time information. Useful for fields such as birthdates, event dates, or transaction dates.

| DateTime | Date and time (including hours, minutes, seconds). Used to track exact moments of events, transactions, or logs. DateTime columns inherit the timezone and date and time format of your workspace. This means that the exact date and time format can vary, depending on your settings. | Follows RFC 3339 protocol. | `13/11/2024 00:00:00`, `11/13/2024 12:00 AM` |
| File | Allows you to upload or download files to/from your data tables. | Maximum file size: `500 MB`. File names can have up to `255` characters. | NA |
| Link to a table | Display data from a different data table in your workspace. Choose a **Linked data table** to select another data table to link to your current table and **Display data from** to determine which column from the data table you have selected displays as a dropdown. | Each data table can link to a maximum of `20` data tables. Data tables supports linking to **short text** and **long text** column types. | NA |
| Multi-value | This column supports storing multiple values in a single cell. Multi-value columns do not support nulls, empty strings, or duplicate values. Sorting columns is not supported. Supported value types include short **Text**, **Integer**, **Decimal**, **Date**, **DateTime**, and **Link to a table**. | Each data table can have a maximum of `20` multi-value columns.

## Embedded API quotas

View Embedded API quotas

Workato enforces rate limits on Embedded APIs to optimize performance and stability. These quotas apply at the Embed admin workspace level, not at the individual customer workspace level or per API key. This means all API requests from an Embed admin workspace share the same rate limit, regardless of which customer workspace is invoked or which admin API key makes the request. The Embedded API is only accessible from Embed admin workspaces.

Requests made to the Embedded API are subject to the following timeout limit:

| Description | Quota |
| --- | --- |
| Timeout limit | 40 seconds |
