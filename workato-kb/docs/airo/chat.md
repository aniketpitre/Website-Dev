> Chat with AIRO from anywhere in Workato. AIRO retains conversation context across pages.

# Chat with AIRO

You can get help, build automations, and manage workflows by chatting with AIRO in the Workato platform.

## Start a new chat

In the sidebar, click **AIRO** to see your recent chats, or click **\+ New chat** to start a new conversation. You can also press A+I to start a new chat from anywhere in the platform. Type your message in the input bar and click **Send** or press Enter to begin.

Press Shift+Enter to insert a line break without sending, so you can write a multi-line prompt.

## Context-aware conversations

AIRO automatically understands your context based on what you're currently viewing or working on.

Examples of conversations you can have with AIRO include:

- **On a project page**: "What's this about?" → AIRO explains the project and its assets
- **On the homepage**: "Where is my Hire to Retire project?" → AIRO locates the project and provides a link that you can follow to go to it
- **While viewing a connection**: "What projects are using this connection?" → AIRO lists the projects using the connection

## Chat persists across the platform

Your conversation continues as you move between pages. You can start on the homepage, navigate to a project, then jump to a recipe editor while keeping your chat thread active.

AIRO automatically creates section separators when you navigate to new pages and send messages. These appear as timestamped headers that help you track what you discussed and when.

This lets AIRO understand what "this" refers to when you ask questions like "Why is this failing?" without re-explaining. The result is natural conversations about your work with a clear record of your workflows.

## Manage multiple conversations

You can create separate chats to keep different topics organized. Click **\+ New chat** (or press A+I) to start a fresh conversation with its own context and history. By default, one conversation continues across all your Workato tabs, but you can switch between chats as needed.

Start a new chat when:

- Working on different projects simultaneously
- Exploring different solutions to the same problem
- Learning about new features while troubleshooting existing work
- Building multiple unrelated assets

This keeps your conversation history organized and makes it easier to find specific discussions later.

## When AIRO is processing

While AIRO works on a request, it displays an "AIRO is working..." message. You can't send another message in this conversation until AIRO responds, but you can:

- Stop the response. Click the stop button, which replaces the send button while AIRO works. AIRO stops within a few seconds.
- Start a new chat to work on something else in parallel, without interrupting the current task.
- Wait for AIRO to finish.

## Chat notifications

AIRO lets you know when a response arrives in a chat you're not currently viewing.

- A gray dot next to a chat in your chat history means you've read the latest response. A blue dot means you haven't.
- AIRO notifies you with an alert, even if you've closed the chat panel. Click **Jump in** to open that conversation, or click the **X** to dismiss it.
- The **AIRO** icon in the sidebar shows the number of unread chats you have.

## Rate and copy responses

You can rate each AIRO response and copy it to your clipboard. Rating responses helps Workato improve AIRO's accuracy over time.

![AIRO response with thumbs up, thumbs down, and copy controls visible below the response](/assets/airo-response-feedback.mShUO4St.gif)_Rate or copy an AIRO response_

Click **Good response** to mark a response as helpful, or **Bad response** to open a dialog where you can select a reason and add optional notes. You can change or clear your rating at any time. Click **Copy** to copy the response text to your clipboard.

## Rich responses in chat

AIRO organizes information such as job success and failure counts or usage breakdowns into headings, tables, and lists, making it easier to scan than plain text.

![AIRO chat response showing a 90-day usage summary formatted as headings and tables.](/assets/acumen-usage.lX4wk2X9.png)_A 90-day usage summary displayed as headings and tables in chat_

Assets created by AIRO include a direct link, so you can open a [new recipe](/en/airo/build/recipes), [generated blueprint](/en/airo/blueprints/create), or other asset from the conversation.

AIRO asks for any information it needs directly in chat, such as [which connection to use](/en/airo/build/recipes#connect-your-apps) for each app in a build.

You can review the work before committing to it—for example, by checking [a diff of recipe changes](/en/airo/build/recipes#track-what-airo-changed) or reviewing [the generated blueprint](/en/airo/blueprints/create#generate-your-blueprint) before building its assets.

## Upload files in chat

You can upload files for AIRO to analyze or attach to a [support ticket](#support-tickets-in-chat). Click **Attach files** in the input bar, or drag and drop files onto the input bar on the homepage or in the chat panel.

![AIRO homepage showing the drag-and-drop file upload prompt.](/assets/upload-files.emx-8RVp.png)_Drag and drop files onto the input bar to upload them_

### Supported file types and size

AIRO accepts the following file types, up to 500 MB each:

- **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, MD, TXT
- **Images**: PNG, JPG, JPEG
- **Videos**: MP4, MOV, WEBM. AIRO can't analyze videos and can only attach them to a [support ticket](#support-tickets-in-chat).

## Support tickets in chat

You can ask AIRO to file a support ticket when its answers don't resolve your request or you're stuck.

AIRO drafts the ticket with relevant context from the conversation, shows you a summary to review or edit, and submits the ticket after you confirm the summary.

You can also ask AIRO to list open tickets, check a ticket's status, or update its details in chat.

Use the [Workato support portal](https://support.workato.com/en/support/home) to file a ticket manually if AIRO can't create one.
