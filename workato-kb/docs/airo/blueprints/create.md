# Create your first blueprint

This guide walks you through creating your first blueprint using employee onboarding as an example.

> **REQUIRED PERMISSIONS**
> 
> Before you begin, ensure you have the following permissions:
> 
> - **Recipes**: Edit, Create, View
> - **Projects**: View (minimum one project)
> - **Connections**: View
> - **Blueprints**: Edit, Create, View

## Define your business process

Start with a process you plan to automate. In this example, when a new employee joins the company, several tasks need to happen automatically: creating accounts, scheduling meetings, providing guidance, and handling requests.

The key is being specific about what should happen and when.

- **Recommended**: "activate an AI assistant on their start date that can schedule meetings, process access requests, and escalate complex issues to support teams."
- **Not recommended**: "help new employees"

Refer to [Describe the outcome, not the task](/en/airo/blueprints/requirements-best-practices#describe-the-outcome-not-the-task) for more on why specificity matters.

## Provide your requirements

You can share your requirements with AIRO in several ways:

- Chat directly with AIRO about what you plan to build
- Upload a requirements file. Refer to [Supported file types and size](/en/airo/chat#supported-file-types-and-size) for what AIRO accepts
- Paste your requirements into the chat

This example uses a product requirements document (PRD) for an "Onboarding Genie" that helps new hires get started.

**Onboarding Genie PRD**

**Summary**

The Onboarding Genie serves as each new hire's AI assistant. It provides real-time status updates, schedules meetings, processes application access requests, and escalates complex issues to support teams. This AI-powered assistant transforms the new hire experience by offering personalized guidance and immediate support throughout the onboarding journey.

**Problem Statement**

New hires currently feel lost and uninformed about their onboarding progress, leading to:

- Confusion about next steps and expectations
- Difficulty accessing help when needed
- Delays in resolving onboarding issues
- Poor new employee satisfaction affecting retention

**Applications & Objects**

| Application | Purpose | Objects/Data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workday | Employee data and management chain | Workers, Positions, Manager relationships |
| Outlook | Meeting scheduling and calendar management | Users, Calendar Events, Availability |
| Okta | Identity verification and access requests | Users, Groups, Applications |
| Jira | Issue tracking and escalation | Tickets, Projects, Assignments |

**Triggers**

| Process | Trigger | Frequency / Schedule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Onboarding Genie Activation | New hire's employee record reaches their start date | Real-time (event-based) |

**Functional Requirements**

**AI Assistant Activation and Core Functionality**

**Requirements:**

- Activate the Onboarding Genie on the new hire's start date
- The Genie must provide personalized guidance based on the employee's position and department
- The Genie must provide status updates on onboarding progress and next steps

**Implementation Details:**

- Extract worker information from Workday for personalization
- Use employee department and role data to customize guidance
- Implement natural language processing for question interpretation
- Maintain session state and conversation history

**Meeting Scheduling Capability**

**Requirements:**

- The Genie must process meeting requests from new hires
- The system must check participant availability using Outlook Calendar
- The Genie must create calendar events with 30-minute default duration
- Meeting invites must be sent to all participants automatically
- The system must handle scheduling conflicts and suggest alternative times

**Implementation Details:**

- Integrate with Outlook Calendar API for availability checks
- Default meeting duration of 30 minutes unless specified otherwise
- Include relevant onboarding context in meeting invitations
- Provide rescheduling options when conflicts occur

**Access Request Management**

**Requirements:**

- The Genie must handle self-service application access requests
- The system must validate requester identity using Okta
- Access requests must be routed to appropriate approval workflows
- The Genie must provide status updates on pending access requests
- The system must notify users when access has been granted or denied

**Implementation Details:**

- Use Okta for identity verification before processing requests
- Route requests based on application type and organizational policies
- Track request status and provide real-time updates
- Send notifications for request status changes

**Issue Escalation and Ticket Creation**

**Requirements:**

- The Genie must identify complex issues that require human intervention
- The system must create Jira tickets for escalated issues with full context
- Tickets must be routed to appropriate support teams based on issue type
- The system must use Workday data to identify correct managers and support contacts
- Escalated issues must include conversation history and relevant employee information

**Implementation Details:**

- Define escalation triggers for different issue types
- Create Jira tickets with comprehensive context and troubleshooting history
- Use Workday manager lookup for proper routing
- Preserve chat history for human support reference
- Provide estimated resolution timelines to employees

**Employee Data Integration**

**Requirements:**

- The system must access employee information via a new Employee Directory API endpoint
- The system must retrieve and utilize the following employee data:
  - Basic information: first name, last name, work email, worker ID, phone
  - Organizational details: department, cost center, manager, direct reports
  - Employment information: start date, position title, employment type, location
  - Status information: active/inactive, PTO status

**Implementation Details:**

- Required parameter: employee\_id
- Use retrieved data for personalized interactions and proper routing
- Cache employee data appropriately for performance
- Handle API failures gracefully with fallback procedures

**Error Handling & Exception Management**

**System Availability Exceptions**

**Condition**: Target systems (Workday, Outlook, Okta, Jira) unavailable

**Resolution**:

- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Provide offline guidance where possible
- Escalate to human support after 3 failed attempts
- Log all system availability issues for monitoring

**Data Integration Exceptions**

**Condition**: Missing or incomplete employee information

**Resolution**:

- Use generic onboarding guidance when personalized data unavailable
- Flag missing data for HR review
- Notify manager of data gaps that affect onboarding quality
- Continue service with available information

**Business Logic Exceptions**

**Condition**: Invalid or complex requests beyond Genie capabilities

**Resolution**:

- Create Jira ticket with full context and conversation history
- Route to appropriate support team based on request type
- Provide estimated resolution timeline to employee
- Send confirmation that issue has been escalated

**Technical Implementation Notes**

- All Jira ticket creation logic must be embedded directly in the Genie workflow
- System must maintain conversation context and history throughout onboarding period
- Escalation procedures must preserve complete chat history for human support context
- Error handling should be graceful with clear communication to users about next steps

## Fill in the gaps

AIRO reviews your requirements and asks targeted questions to ensure nothing is missing. For the onboarding example, AIRO might ask:

> "Should the Genie respond to employees in real-time through chat, or should requests be processed in batches? If real-time, what triggers these interactions—chat events, API calls, or something else?"

This conversation continues until AIRO has enough detail to understand:

- **Problem and business context**: What process you're automating and why
- **Applications and objects**: Which systems and data need to connect
- **Execution and frequency**: When the automation should run
- **Business logic and validation**: What rules and checks should apply
- **Error handling**: What happens when something goes wrong
