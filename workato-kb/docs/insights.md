# Insights

Insights is a data visualization and manipulation engine built into Workato and Workflow apps' no-code environment. It enables business users, IT professionals, and citizen developers to connect, manipulate, and visualize data, making data-driven decisions directly within Workato. You can access Insights from the side navigation bar in **Platform > Insights**.

The basic building blocks of Insights consist of data sources, query components, and chart components. When combined, these building blocks form data reports and visualizations called dashboards.

Use Insights for the following types of data analysis:

- [Usage analytics](#usage-analytics)
- [Automation impact](#automation-impact)
- [App analytics](#app-analytics)
- [Workflow performance](#workflow-performance)
