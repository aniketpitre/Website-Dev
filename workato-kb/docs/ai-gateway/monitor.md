> Use the Model Gateway dashboard to monitor request volume, token usage, and success rates across your workspace.

# Model Gateway dashboard

The Model Gateway dashboard provides visibility into the traffic flowing through your [gateway](/en/ai-gateway). Use it to monitor request volume, track token consumption, and identify errors across your workspace.

You can open the dashboard from **Model Gateway > Dashboard**.

The dashboard is scoped to the current workspace. Use the **Period** filter to set the time range for the metrics displayed. The **Last updated** timestamp shows when Model Gateway last refreshed the data.

## Summary metrics

The dashboard header displays the following for the selected time range:

- **Total requests this period**: The number of requests that passed through the gateway.
- **Total token usage this period**: The number of tokens consumed across all requests.
- **Active keys**: The number of access keys issued.
- **Success rate**: The percentage of requests that succeeded.

## Requests

The **Requests** view charts request activity across the selected time range. Use the **Group by** drop-down menu to group the data by outcome, model, provider, or route.

This view includes the following panels:

- **Requests over time**: An overview of successful and failed requests across the selected time range.
- **Successful vs. failed requests**: A count of successful and failed requests.
- **Errors by type**: A breakdown of failed requests by error type.

## Token usage

Click **Token usage** to switch from request activity to token consumption. Use the **Group by** drop-down menu to group the data by type, model, provider, or route.
