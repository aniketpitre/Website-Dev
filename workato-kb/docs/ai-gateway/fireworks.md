> Use your own Fireworks AI API key with Model Gateway to route requests to open-weight models hosted on Fireworks AI.

# Connect Fireworks AI

[Fireworks AI](https://fireworks.ai/) hosts open-weight models, such as Llama, DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, and GLM, behind an OpenAI-compatible API. Connect your Fireworks AI API key to [Model Gateway](/en/ai-gateway) to route requests to the open-weight models Fireworks AI serves.

Model Gateway stores your Fireworks AI API key in a [provider](/en/ai-gateway/providers) connection. Applications authenticate with Model Gateway [access keys](/en/ai-gateway/access-keys) instead of your Fireworks AI API key, and [policies](/en/ai-gateway/policies) apply rate limits, token limits, and IP restrictions to Fireworks AI traffic the same way they apply to every other provider.

> **FEATURE AVAILABILITY**
> 
> Model Gateway is available to select customers. Contact your Customer Success Representative to confirm whether it is available in your workspace.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following to connect Fireworks AI to Model Gateway:

- A [Fireworks AI](https://fireworks.ai/) account with available credits. Fireworks AI suspends accounts with no credits, and a suspended account can't create API keys or send requests. Add credits or a payment method in [Billing](https://app.fireworks.ai/account/billing).
- Access to Model Gateway in your Workato workspace

## Fireworks AI API details

Model Gateway connects to Fireworks AI through the **Fireworks** provider type, which uses the following values:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| API URL | `https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1` (default) |
| Authentication | Fireworks AI API key, sent as a bearer token |
| Model ID format | `accounts/fireworks/models/<model-name>`, for example `accounts/fireworks/models/gpt-oss-120b` |

Refer to the [Fireworks AI OpenAI compatibility documentation](https://docs.fireworks.ai/tools-sdks/openai-compatibility) for more information about the Fireworks AI API.

## Create a Fireworks AI API key

Complete the following steps to create an API key in Fireworks AI:

1. Sign in to Fireworks AI and go to **Settings > [API Keys](https://app.fireworks.ai/settings/users/api-keys)**.
   
2. Click **Create API Key**, then select **API Key**.
   
   ![Select API Key](/assets/fireworks-select-api-key.CdLPvD8r.png)_Select **API Key**_
   
   > **SERVICE ACCOUNT API KEYS**
   > 
   > Consider **Service Account API Keys** for production use. Fireworks AI recommends service accounts for backend services and automated workflows, and its audit logs show service account activity separately from user activity. Refer to [Service accounts](https://docs.fireworks.ai/accounts/service-accounts) in the Fireworks AI documentation.
   
3. Enter a name in the **API Key Name** field to identify the key later, for example `Workato Model Gateway`.
   
   ![Create a Fireworks AI API key](/assets/fireworks-create-api-key.lDa0cdQy.png)_Create a Fireworks AI API key_
   
4. Optional. Select **Set expiration date** to choose when the key expires. Keys expire in one year by default.
   
   > **KEY EXPIRATION**
   > 
   > Requests through Model Gateway fail after the Fireworks AI API key expires. Create a new key before the expiration date and [edit the provider](/en/ai-gateway/providers#edit-a-provider) to enter it.
   
5. Click **Generate Key**.
   
6. Click the copy icon next to the **API Key** value in the **Copy your API Key** dialog, then store the key in a safe location. You need this key when you add the provider in Model Gateway.
   
   > **KEY DISPLAYS ONCE**
   > 
   > Fireworks AI displays the API key one time only. Copy the key before you click **Close**. Create a new key if you lose it.
   

## Add Fireworks AI as a provider

Complete the following steps to add Fireworks AI as a provider in Model Gateway:

1. Go to **Model Gateway > Providers**.
   
2. Click **\+ Add provider**.
   
3. Enter a descriptive name in the **Connection name** field. For example, `Fireworks AI`.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project or folder where you plan to store this provider.
   
5. Keep **Cloud** selected in the **Connection type** drop-down menu.
   
6. Use the **LLM Provider** drop-down menu to select **Fireworks**.
   
   ![Configure your Fireworks AI provider](/assets/fireworks-provider.BSptIaIN.png)_Configure your Fireworks AI provider_
   
7. Enter your Fireworks AI API key in the **API Key** field.
   
8. Optional. Enter the API base URL, including the API version, in the **API URL** field. Leave this field blank to use the Fireworks AI default, `https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1`.
   
9. Click **Connect**.
   

The provider displays in the **Providers** list with a **Connected** status.

Existing providers that use the **OpenAI Compatible** provider type with the API URL `https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1` continue to work. You don't need to recreate them.

## Find a Fireworks AI model ID

Each [route](#create-a-route-to-a-fireworks-ai-model) sends requests to one Fireworks AI model, which you specify by its model ID in the route's **Model** field. The **Model** field suggests Fireworks AI models, and the model library shows each model's capabilities so you can choose one or find a model that isn't suggested. Fireworks AI identifies each model by its full path, not its display name.

Complete the following steps to find a model ID:

1. Go to the [Fireworks AI model library](https://fireworks.ai/models) and click the model you plan to use.
   
2. Copy the value labeled **model path** under the model name, for example `accounts/fireworks/models/gpt-oss-120b`. This value is the model ID.
   
3. Confirm **Serverless** is listed as **Supported** under **Supporting Functionality**. Serverless models are billed per token and don't require setup in Fireworks AI.
   

Fireworks AI model support varies by model. For example, only some models support function calling or image input. Check **Supporting Functionality** on the model's page before you route production traffic to it.

## Create a route to a Fireworks AI model

A direct route sends every request to the same provider and model. Complete the following steps to create a direct route to a Fireworks AI model:

1. Go to **Model Gateway > Routes** and click **\+ Create route**.
   
2. Select **Direct** in the **Select route type** field.
   
3. Enter a name in the **Route name** field. Model Gateway generates the **Route ID** from the route name. Applications use the route ID as the `model` value in their requests.
   
   ![Configure your route](/assets/fireworks-create-route.CAlwRAjG.png)_Configure your route_
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project or folder where you plan to store this route.
   
5. Use the **Provider** drop-down menu to select the Fireworks AI provider you created.
   
6. Select a model in the **Model** field, or enter a model ID manually, for example `accounts/fireworks/models/gpt-oss-120b`.
   
   The list can include models that don't support chat requests, such as embedding and reranker models. Check a model's capabilities in the Fireworks AI model library before you select it. Refer to [Find a Fireworks AI model ID](#find-a-fireworks-ai-model-id).
   
7. Optional. Use the **Policy** drop-down menu to select a policy to govern the use of this route.
   
8. Click **Create**.
   

Refer to [Routes](/en/ai-gateway/routes) to create rule-based and intelligent routes. For example, a rule-based route can send requests from one team to a Fireworks AI model and send all other requests to a different provider. Refer to [Route builder](/en/ai-gateway/route-builder) to define the rules.

## Create an access key

Create an access key that includes the Fireworks AI route. Applications use this key to authenticate with Model Gateway instead of your Fireworks AI API key. Refer to [Create an access key](/en/ai-gateway/access-keys#create-an-access-key).

## Send a request to a Fireworks AI model

Authenticate with your Model Gateway access key and pass the route ID as the `model` value. Model Gateway resolves the route to your Fireworks AI provider and model, applies any assigned policy, and forwards the request to Fireworks AI with your Fireworks AI API key.

**cURL**

Replace `<model-gateway-url>` in the following example with the URL shown in the **Access key generated** dialog when you created the access key:

```shell
curl <model-gateway-url> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access-key>" \
  -d '{
    "model": "<route-id>",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**OpenAI Python SDK**

Replace `<model-gateway-host>` in the following example with the host from the URL shown in the **Access key generated** dialog, for example `https://ai.workato.com`:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="<model-gateway-host>/v1",
    api_key="<access-key>",
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="<route-id>",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

The `model` field in the response shows the Fireworks AI model that served the request, for example `accounts/fireworks/models/gpt-oss-120b`.

Model Gateway also accepts Anthropic-compatible requests for routes backed by Fireworks AI. Refer to [Test a route](/en/ai-gateway/test-route) for an Anthropic-compatible example, and [Connect clients](/en/ai-gateway/connect-clients) to configure Claude Code and the Anthropic SDKs.

## Fireworks AI behavior

The following behavior applies to Fireworks AI requests you send through Model Gateway:

- **Context length**: Fireworks AI reduces `max_tokens` by default when the prompt plus `max_tokens` exceeds the model's context window. OpenAI returns an error instead. Set `context_length_exceeded_behavior` to `error` in the request body to return an error.
- **Function calling**: Fireworks AI supports OpenAI-compatible function calling on models that support it. Check the model's capabilities before you rely on function calling or parallel function calls.
- **Reasoning models**: Reasoning models, such as `gpt-oss-120b`, return their reasoning in the `reasoning_content` field of the response message, in addition to the answer in the `content` field.
- **Streaming**: Fireworks AI supports streaming responses. Model Gateway supports Server-Sent Events (SSE) end to end, so streaming responses from Fireworks AI render incrementally.

Usage and billing for Fireworks AI models apply to your Fireworks AI account. Refer to the [Fireworks AI documentation](https://docs.fireworks.ai/) for model pricing and rate limits.

## Troubleshooting

Use the following troubleshooting information to fix failed requests to a Fireworks AI route. Error responses that come from Fireworks AI include `"error_from_provider": true`, and the `error.message` field contains the Fireworks AI error message. Errors without this field come from Model Gateway, which means the request didn't reach Fireworks AI.

### Access key rejected

Model Gateway returns `401` and the message `can't authorize request: invalid credentials` when it doesn't recognize the access key in the `Authorization` header. This error often occurs when the header contains extra characters, such as a line break or a key pasted more than once. Confirm the header uses the format `Bearer <access-key>` with the full access key, or create a new [access key](/en/ai-gateway/access-keys#create-an-access-key) if you no longer have the original.

### Provider unreachable

Model Gateway returns `Error 503` when it can't reach the provider while you add or edit it. Confirm the **API URL** field is blank or set to `https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1`, then click **Connect** or **Save** again.

### Fireworks AI API key rejected

Fireworks AI returns the message `The API key you provided is invalid.` when the Fireworks AI API key on the provider is invalid or expired. Confirm the key is active in Fireworks AI, then [edit the provider](/en/ai-gateway/providers#edit-a-provider) to enter a new key if needed.

Providers that use the **OpenAI Compatible** provider type return a similar error when the **API URL** field is blank. A blank **API URL** sends requests to OpenAI, which rejects the Fireworks AI API key with the message `Incorrect API key provided`. Edit the provider and enter `https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1` in the **API URL** field, or add a new provider with the **Fireworks** provider type.

### Fireworks AI account suspended

Fireworks AI suspends accounts that have no credits and returns the message `account is suspended due to CREDIT_DEPLETED`. Add credits or a payment method in Fireworks AI [Billing](https://app.fireworks.ai/account/billing) to reactivate the account.

### Model not found

Fireworks AI returns the message `Model not found, inaccessible, and/or not deployed` when the route's **Model** field doesn't match a model it serves. This error occurs when the field contains a display name instead of a model ID, or when the model doesn't support serverless. Edit the route and confirm the **Model** field uses the full model path, for example `accounts/fireworks/models/gpt-oss-120b`. Refer to [Find a Fireworks AI model ID](#find-a-fireworks-ai-model-id) to confirm the model supports serverless.

### Route not found

Model Gateway returns `404` and the message `model "<route-id>" not found` when it can't find the route ID in the `model` value of the request. Confirm the `model` value matches the **Route ID** on the route. Then confirm the access key includes the route in its **Route(s)** list, and [edit the access key](/en/ai-gateway/access-keys#edit-an-access-key) to add the route if needed.
