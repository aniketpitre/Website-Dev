> Configure Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and the Anthropic Python and TypeScript SDKs to send requests through Model Gateway.

# Connect clients

Point a client at [Model Gateway](/en/ai-gateway) instead of a provider to route its requests through your routes and policies. Each client needs an [access key](/en/ai-gateway/access-keys) and the route ID of a route the key can use.

## Connect Anthropic-compatible clients

Model Gateway only accepts the access key as a bearer token in the `Authorization` header. Anthropic clients send credentials in an `x-api-key` header by default, so configure the client to send a bearer token instead. Set the model to a route ID.

Replace `<model-gateway-host>` with the host from the URL shown in the **Access key generated** dialog, for example `https://ai.workato.com`.

**Claude Desktop**

> **ROUTE ID NAMING**
> 
> Claude Desktop only accepts route IDs that resemble Claude model IDs, such as `claude-sonnet-4-5` or the generic `anthropic/claude`. A route ID like `gateways-test` fails. Model Gateway generates the route ID from the route name, so the route must be named after the models it uses.

Complete the following steps to connect Claude Desktop to Model Gateway:

1. [Create a route](/en/ai-gateway/routes#create-a-route) and enter a route name that generates a route ID resembling a Claude model ID, for example `anthropic/claude`. Check the **Route ID** field before you click **Create**. Then [create an access key](/en/ai-gateway/access-keys#create-an-access-key) that includes the route.
   
2. Open Claude Desktop without signing in.
   
3. Select **Help > Troubleshooting > Enable Developer Mode** from the menu bar.
   
4. Select **Developer > Configure Third-Party Inference** from the menu bar.

5. Use the **Connection** drop-down menu to select **Gateway**.

6. Use the **Credential kind** drop-down menu under **Gateway credentials** to select **Static API key**.
   
7. Enter `<model-gateway-host>/anthropic` in the **Gateway base URL** field. Replace `<model-gateway-host>` with the host from the example request URL shown in the **Access key generated** dialog. For example, if the dialog displays `https://ai.workato.com/v1/chat/completions`, enter `https://ai.workato.com/anthropic`.
   
8. Enter your access key in the **Gateway API key** field.
   
9. Use the **Auth scheme** drop-down menu to select **Bearer**. The **Bearer** authentication scheme sends the access key as a bearer token in the `Authorization` header.
   
10. Enter the route ID in the **Model ID** field under **Model list**.
    
    ![Model list](/assets/claude-desktop-model-list.C9U7vUCZ.png)_Model list_
    
11. Optional. Enter a name in the **Display name** field. Claude Desktop shows this name in the model picker. Leave this field blank to generate the name from the route ID.
    
12. Click **Apply Changes** and restart Claude Desktop if prompted.
    

**Claude Code**

These variables apply to the Claude Code CLI and IDE extensions. Claude Code in Claude Desktop uses the Claude Desktop gateway settings instead.

Run the following commands before you start Claude Code:

```shell
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=<model-gateway-host>/anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=<access-key>
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=<route-id>
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL=<route-id>
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL=<route-id>
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL=<route-id>
unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` sends the access key as a bearer token. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` sends an `x-api-key` header, which Model Gateway doesn't support.

Subagents and the `/model` menu use the `opus`, `sonnet`, and `haiku` model aliases, which resolve to Claude model names unless you set the `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` variables. Set each variable to a route ID so these requests also resolve to a route. You can point each alias to a different route.

**Python SDK**

Pass the access key as `auth_token`, not `api_key`:

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(
    base_url="<model-gateway-host>/anthropic",
    auth_token="<access-key>",
)

message = client.messages.create(
    model="<route-id>",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
)
```

**TypeScript SDK**

Pass the access key as `authToken`, not `apiKey`:

```ts
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const client = new Anthropic({
  baseURL: '<model-gateway-host>/anthropic',
  authToken: '<access-key>',
});

const message = await client.messages.create({
  model: '<route-id>',
  max_tokens: 1024,
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
});
```
