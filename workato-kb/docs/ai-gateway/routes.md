> Create, edit, and delete the Model Gateway routes that determine which provider and model serves each request.

# Routes

A route is the target that serves a request in [Model Gateway](/en/ai-gateway). A route resolves to a provider and model, either directly or through rules. Applications reference a route by its route ID, so you can re-point traffic without editing client code.

## Create a route

Complete the following steps to create a route. The fields depend on the route type you select:

> **PREREQUISITES**
> 
> You must add at least one [provider](/en/ai-gateway/providers#add-a-provider) before you create a route.

> **ROUTE ID NAMING FOR CLAUDE DESKTOP**
> 
> Claude Desktop only accepts route IDs that resemble Claude model IDs, such as `claude-sonnet-4-5` or the generic `anthropic/claude`. Model Gateway generates the route ID from the route name, so name the route after the models it uses if you plan to connect Claude Desktop. Refer to [Connect Anthropic-compatible clients](/en/ai-gateway/connect-clients#connect-anthropic-compatible-clients) for more information.

**Direct**

### Direct route

A direct route sends every request to the same provider and model.

1. Go to **Model Gateway > Routes** and click **\+ Create route**.
   
2. Select **Direct** in the **Select route type** field.

3. Enter a name in the **Route name** field. Model Gateway generates the **Route ID** from the route name. Use the route ID as the identifier in your LLM prompt calls.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project or folder where you plan to store this route.
   
5. Use the **Provider** drop-down menu to select an active LLM provider to use for this route. Connect a provider first if none are available.
   
6. Select the model to use for this route in the **Model** field. Choose a suggested model from the list, or enter one manually.
   
7. Optional. Use the **Policy** drop-down menu to select a policy to govern the use of this route.
   
8. Optional. Expand **Limits** and enter the maximum time allowed for a single attempt before it fails in the **Attempt timeout (in seconds)** field. This value must be less than or equal to the request timeout.
   
9. Click **Create**.
   

**Rule-based**

### Rule-based route

A rule-based route sends requests to a provider and model based on rules that match on tags, keys, or parameters. Requests that match no rule use the default provider and model.

1. Go to **Model Gateway > Routes** and click **\+ Create route**.
   
2. Select **Rule-based** in the **Select route type** field.

3. Enter a name in the **Route name** field. Model Gateway generates the **Route ID** from the route name. Use the route ID as the identifier in your LLM prompt calls.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project or folder where you plan to store this route.
   
5. Use the **Default provider** drop-down menu to select an active LLM provider to use by default for this route. Connect a provider first if none are available.
   
6. Select the model to use by default for this route in the **Default model** field. Choose a suggested model from the list, or enter one manually.
   
7. Optional. Use the **Policy** drop-down menu to select a policy to govern the use of this route.
   
8. Optional. Expand **Limits** and enter the maximum time allowed for a single attempt before it fails in the **Attempt timeout (in seconds)** field. This value must be less than or equal to the request timeout.
   
9. Click **Create**.
   
10. Define the rules that override the default provider and model. Refer to [Route builder](/en/ai-gateway/route-builder).
    

**Intelligent**

### Intelligent route

An intelligent route sends requests to a provider and model based on the complexity of the request. Requests that match no rule use the default provider and model.

1. Go to **Model Gateway > Routes** and click **\+ Create route**.
   
2. Select **Intelligent** in the **Select route type** field.
   
   ![Create route](/assets/create-route-intelligent.B_-QDwW9.png)_Create route_
   
3. Enter a name in the **Route name** field. Model Gateway generates the **Route ID** from the route name. Use the route ID as the identifier in your LLM prompt calls.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project or folder where you plan to store this route.
   
5. Use the **Default provider** drop-down menu to select an active LLM provider to use by default for this route. Connect a provider first if none are available.
   
6. Select the model to use by default for this route in the **Default model** field. Choose a suggested model from the list, or enter one manually.
   
7. Optional. Use the **Policy** drop-down menu to select a policy to govern the use of this route.
   
8. Optional. Expand **Limits** and enter the maximum time allowed for a single attempt before it fails in the **Attempt timeout (in seconds)** field. This value must be less than or equal to the request timeout.
   
9. Click **Create**.
   
10. Define the rules that override the default provider and model. Refer to [Route builder](/en/ai-gateway/route-builder).
    

## Route details

Click a route in the **Routes** list to open its details page. The details panel displays the following:

- **Type**: The route type, either **Direct**, **Rule-based**, or **Intelligent**.
- **Route ID**: The identifier to use in your LLM prompt calls.
- **Location**: The project or folder that stores the route.
- **Description**: An optional description for the route. Click **Edit** to add or change it.
- **Created**: The date and time the route was created.

Click the edit icon next to the route name to rename the route.

## Edit a route

Editing a route opens the route builder, where you configure the route on a canvas instead of in a form.

Complete the following steps to edit a route:

1. Go to **Model Gateway > Routes** and click the route you plan to edit.
   
2. Click **Edit** to open the route builder.
   
   ![Edit route](/assets/edit-gateway-route.bSfZ41xv.png)_Edit route_
   
3. Click a step on the canvas to configure it:
   
   - Click the **New LLM Call** step to change the **Policy** that applies to all requests. Click **Create a new one** if you need a policy that doesn't exist yet.
   - Click a **Route to** step to change its **Provider** and **Model**.
4. Click **Save**, then click **Exit** to leave the route builder.
   

Refer to [Route builder](/en/ai-gateway/route-builder) to add rules to a rule-based or intelligent route.

## Delete a route

Complete the following steps to delete a route:

1. Go to **Model Gateway > Routes**.
   
2. Click the **...** (ellipsis) menu for the route you plan to delete, then click **Delete**.
   
3. Click **Delete** to confirm.
   

> **KEYS STOP FUNCTIONING**
> 
> Any access key that uses a deleted route no longer functions and must be recreated.

## Validation messages

Model Gateway returns the following validation messages when you create or edit a route:

| Field | Message | Condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Attempt timeout (in seconds)** | `Value must be between 1 and 360 seconds.` | The value is outside the supported range. |

---
