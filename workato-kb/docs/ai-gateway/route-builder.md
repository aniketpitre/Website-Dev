> Use the route builder to define rules that route LLM requests to a specific provider and model based on tags, keys, parameters, or complexity.

# Route builder

The route builder is a visual canvas where you configure how [Model Gateway](/en/ai-gateway) resolves each request to a provider and model. Every route opens in the route builder, and rule-based and intelligent routes use it to define rules. Instead of hardcoding a model in every application that calls an LLM, you configure the target once in the gateway and change it through configuration.

Rules evaluate in order. The first rule whose conditions match sets the provider and model for the request. When no rule matches, the request falls through to the route's default target.

## Route types

Select a route type when you create a route. Model Gateway offers the following route types:

| Route type | Description | Supports rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Direct** | Routes requests directly to a selected model. | No |
| **Rule-based** | Routes requests based on the tags, keys, and parameters attached to the request. | Yes |
| **Intelligent** | Routes requests by complexity. | Yes |

A **Direct** route uses a single **Provider** and **Model** for every request. **Rule-based** and **Intelligent** routes use a **Default provider** and **Default model** instead, which serve any request that no rule matches.

Refer to [Create a route](/en/ai-gateway/routes#create-a-route) to create a route and select its type. Define the rules for a rule-based or intelligent route after you create it.

## Canvas

The route builder canvas displays the path a request takes through the route:

- **Request**: The entry point, labeled **New LLM Call**. This step displays the policy applied to the route, or **No policy applied** when the route has no policy.
- **Rules**: The steps that resolve the request to a provider and model. A direct route has a single **Route to** step. A rule-based or intelligent route lists its rules in evaluation order, and each rule displays as a statement in the format `IF <condition> ROUTE TO <provider> / <model>`.
- **Default target**: The final step on a rule-based or intelligent route, which routes any request that matches no rule to the route's default provider and model. This step is labeled **Route to** until you add a rule, and **Else route to** after that.
- **End**: The end of the route.

Use the zoom control to change the canvas scale, and click the code icon to switch between the canvas and the YAML view.

Click **Edit** on the route's details page to open the route builder, then click a step on the canvas to configure it. Click the **New LLM Call** step to change the policy, or a **Route to** step to change its provider and model. Refer to [Edit a route](/en/ai-gateway/routes#edit-a-route).

Click **Save** to apply your changes, or **Exit** to leave the route builder.

## Add a rule

Complete the following steps to add a rule:

1. Open the route you plan to edit, then click **Edit** to open the route builder.
   
2. Click the add icon (**+**) on the connector where you plan to insert the rule, then click **Add rule**.
   
   ![Add rule](/assets/add-new-rule.Bo-uDNzE.png)_Add rule_
   
3. Click the **Rule** step to open its configuration panel.
   
4. Use the **Provider** drop-down menu in the **Model** section to select the provider this rule routes to.
   
   ![Configure rule](/assets/configure-new-rule.qWlU6Zpm.png)_Configure rule_
   
5. Use the **Model** drop-down menu to select the model this rule routes to.
   
6. Use the **Type** drop-down menu in the **Conditions** section to select what the rule matches on. Refer to [Condition types](#condition-types) for the available types.
   
7. Use the **Value** drop-down menu to select the value the condition matches. The **Condition** operator is `equals`.
   
8. Click **Save**.
   

### Condition types

The **Type** drop-down menu offers the following condition types:

| Type | Route type | Matches on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tag** | Rule-based | A tag assigned to the access key that sent the request. |
| **Key** | Rule-based | The access key that sent the request. |
| **Parameter** | Rule-based | A parameter name and value configured on the access key. |
| **Complexity** | Intelligent | The complexity of the request. Available values are `Simple`, `Medium`, `Complex`, and `Reasoning`. |

Select **Parameter** to display an additional **Parameter** field, where you select the parameter name the rule matches. Assign tags and parameters to an access key when you create or edit the key.

### Combine conditions

A rule can require more than one condition. Click the add icon at the bottom of the **Conditions** section to add a condition to the rule. All conditions must hold for the rule to match.

Click **Delete** next to a condition to remove it from the rule.

## Change the default target

The default target serves any request that no rule matches.

Complete the following steps to change the default target:

1. Open the route you plan to edit, then click **Edit** to open the route builder.
   
2. Click the last step on the canvas. This step is labeled **Route to** on a route with no rules, and **Else route to** on a route with one or more rules.
   
3. Use the **Provider** and **Model** drop-down menus to select the new default target.
   
4. Click **Save**.
   

## Assign a policy to a route

A policy applies to every request that passes through the route, including requests that match a rule.

Complete the following steps to assign a policy:

1. Open the route you plan to edit, then click **Edit** to open the route builder.
   
2. Click the **New LLM Call** step on the canvas.
   
3. Use the **Policy** drop-down menu to select a policy to assign to all requests. Click **Create a new one** if you need a policy that doesn't exist yet.
   
   ![Assign a policy](/assets/assign-policy.D-5kxs4K.png)_Assign a policy_
   
4. Click **Save**.
   

## View a route as YAML

Click the code icon in the route builder to display the route's configuration as YAML. This view is read-only and shows the request, the ordered routing rules with their conditions and targets, and the route metadata.
