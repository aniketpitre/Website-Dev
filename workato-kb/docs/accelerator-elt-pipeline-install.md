2. Within the newly-created **ELT Pipeline for Snowflake** project, create a new folder. Name the folder **Slack** or **Microsoft Teams**.
   
3. Import the package **ELT Pipeline for Slack.zip** or **ELT\_Pipeline\_for\_MS\_Teams.zip** using the [Recipe Lifecycle Management](/en/recipe-development-lifecycle/import) tool or with the [Import package into a folder API.](/en/workato-api/recipe-lifecycle-management#import-package-into-a-folder)
