# Collaborator roles

Collaborator roles control access to Workato features, functions, and folders of [Role-based access control](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/).

> **LEGACY MODEL**
> 
> This page describes the legacy permissions model. Workato is replacing legacy roles with the new permissions model, which uses environment roles and project roles. Refer to the [New permissions model](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/access-control-v2) documentation to plan and migrate.

This guide covers the following topics:

- [Workato's built-in system roles](#system-roles)
- [Add collaborator roles](#custom-roles)

To learn about the privileges collaborators can have, see [Collaborator privileges](/en/privileges).

## System roles

Workato pre-defines system roles so you can assign them to workspace collaborators, based on the access each user requires.

> **ROLE SCOPE**
> 
> Workato may change the specific set of privileges in system roles to support new platform features. These changes can expand or limit access but don't alter the role's core purpose.
> 
> In contrast, Workato doesn't update the scope of custom roles. Review custom roles regularly to ensure they meet your workspace's access requirements.

Workato has three system roles: [Admin](#role-admin), [Analyst](#role-analyst), and [Operator](#role-operator).

You cannot edit these roles directly. However, you can [clone](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/#cloning-roles) each role, and then modify it.

To view the privileges of a system role, an Admin can select a role in the **Roles** tab. This opens a read-only version of the role.

> **WORKSPACE OWNER**
> 
> The workspace owner has direct (root) access to the workspace, which is different from a designated role. Workato advises against using the root login for tasks requiring administrative privileges and recommends limiting its use to emergencies. For example, you can use the root log in to recover access to your admin workspace if you've lost access due to misconfiguring SAML.
> 
> The following privileges are associated with the root login of a workspace:
> 
> - All Admin role privileges
>   
> - All privileges included in the Admin role.
>   
> - Full Workspace admin settings access
>   
> - Access to all workspace admin settings.
>   

### Admin

The Admin role is typically granted to users managing the Workato workspace and is the most permissive system role. This role grants privileges to manage workspace settings and offers unique permissions for managing advanced settings such as key management, debugging, notifications, and secrets management. These permissions are exclusive to the Admin role and are not available to any other system or custom roles.

> **CLONING AN ADMIN ROLE**
> 
> Workato supports the cloning of all system and custom roles within your workspace. However, when you [clone](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/#cloning-roles) the Admin role, the unique permissions for managing advanced workspace settings do not transfer to the newly-created role. To grant collaborators the ability to manage workspace settings, they must be assigned to the Admin system role.

### Operator

Operators are users who focus on maintaining and validating existing recipes. This is the least permissive system role.

This role includes **read-only** access to **All folders** and **All projects**.

<dl class="horizontal-dl"><dt>View projects</dt><dd>View specific projects in a workspace.</dd><dt>View folders</dt><dd>View folders and sub-folders in a workspace.</dd><dt>View recipes</dt><dd>View recipes in a workspace.</dd><dt>Test (start/stop) recipes</dt><dd>Run recipes and start and stop recipe tests in a workspace.</dd><dt>View recipe job history</dt><dd>View a recipe's job history in the Jobs tab.</dd><dt>View recipe job history</dt><dd>View a recipe's job history in the Jobs tab.</dd><dt>View Genies</dt><dd>Read-only access to <a href="/en/agentic/agent-studio.html">Genies</a>.</dd><dt>View Knowledge Bases</dt><dd>Read-only access to <a href="/en/agentic/agent-studio/create-a-genie.html#create-a-knowledge-base">Knowledge Bases</a>.</dd><dt>View data pipelines</dt><dd>Read-only access to <a href="/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/create-data-pipeline-recipe.html">data pipelines</a>.</dd><dt>All projects</dt><dd>Access to all <a href="/en/projects.html">projects</a> in a workspace.</dd></dl>

Additionally, this role includes **read-only** access to the Test Automation feature.

<dl class="horizontal-dl"><dt>View Test Automation</dt><dd>View test cases, including mock data and checks in the <a href="/en/test-automation.html">Test Automation</a> feature.</dd></dl>

## Add collaborator roles

In addition to system roles, you can create additional custom collaborator roles to assign more granular privileges to workspace collaborators. System roles have preset permissions, but the roles you add can be customized, allowing you to control access levels for projects, recipes, tools, and more.

For example, you can assign distinct collaborator roles to development, QA, and production teams within the same workspace, each with specific privileges that align with the [recipe development lifecycle](/en/recipe-development-lifecycle).

[Inheritable roles](/en/automation-hq#inheritable-roles) are custom roles that AHQ admins create in the HQ workspace. These roles automatically appear in all managed workspaces as non-editable roles.

Refer to the [Role-based access guide](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/#creating-custom-roles) to learn how to add a collaborator role.

> **FEATURE AVAILABILITY**
> 
> The custom collaborator role feature is included in specific pricing plans. Refer to your pricing plan and contract to learn more.
