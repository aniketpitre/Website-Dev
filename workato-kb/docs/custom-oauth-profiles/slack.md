# Custom OAuth profiles for Slack

## What are custom OAuth profiles?

Custom OAuth profiles allow your Slack apps to leverage the Workato Slack connector under the hood. You can fully customize your Slack app's identity, i.e.:

- Branding (bot name, bot logos, background color)
- Permissions

## When would I need custom OAuth profiles for Slack

1. You want multiple apps that each perform workspace orchestration as part of their automations, for example, creating/archiving conversations. For example, an EscalationBot could create a private conversation, invite crisis management team members, and archive it once the issue is resolved. At the same time, BirthdayBot could perform the same actions – create a private conversation, invite the party planners, and archive it once the birthday is over – but for vastly different purposes.
   
2. You want control over your app's branding & appearance
   
3. You want control over your bot's permissions. The minimum permissions for optimal use are listed in the table below.
   

| Token type | Scope | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bot | None | No bot scopes required. |
| User | `channels:read` | Retrieves list of public conversations. |
| `channels:write` | Create/update public conversations. |
| `groups:read` | Retrieves list of private conversations. |
| `groups:write` | Create/update private conversations. |
| `im:read` | Retrieves list of direct message conversations. |
| `im:write` | Create/update direct message conversations. |
| `mpim:write` | Create/update multi-party group conversations. |
| `mpim:read` | Retrieves list of multi-party group conversations. |
| `chat:write` | Post messages as user. |
| `users:read` | Get user info. |
| `users:read.email` | Get user info by email. |

> **Migration to granular scopes**

> Slack released [granular permissions](https://api.slack.com/docs/token-types#granular_bot) on 22 January 2020. You may have to migrate any pre-existing custom Slack apps you have connected to Workato. migration guide for more details.

## Creating a custom OAuth profile

3. Click **New custom profile**.
   
4. On the **New custom profile** page:
   
   - In Step 1, select **Slack**.
   - In Step 2, provide a name for your new app, then click **Create new app.** This will open a new tab that brings you to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps). Keep both the Workato tab and this new tab open - you'll need both to complete the remaining steps.

2. Click **Create**.

### Step 3: Configure Workato to talk to your Slack app

1. Head back to the Workato tab to complete Step 3.
   
2. In Step 3, fill in the following:
   
   - **Client ID**: Paste the **Client ID** value from Slack into this field.
   - **Client secret**: Paste the **Client secret** value from Slack into this field.
   - **Verification token**: Paste the **Verification Token** value from Slack into this field.
3. Click **Save** when you're finished.
   

### Step 4: Complete the connection in Workato

You're almost there! All that's left is to complete the connection in Workato.

1. In the open Workato tab, click **Done**. Go to any project folder to create a new Slack connection.
   
2. Provide a name for your Slack connection. In the **Custom OAuth profile** field, select the newly created OAuth profile. Click **Connect**.
