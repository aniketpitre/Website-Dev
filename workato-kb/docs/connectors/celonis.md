4. This will bring you to Celonis's process automations where you can trigger automations on this signal. Here, you'll find the Workato connector which can trigger new recipes.
   
5. When prompted for the URL for the Workato connector, you will need to head over to Workato and retrieve the `Webhook URL` in your Celonis trigger.

6. Be sure to define the payload on the Celonis end to provide sufficient details for your Workato recipe to work. This should include details such as the specific purchase order number.
   
7. Publish your process automation and head back to your project in the action engine on Celonis. Go through the steps to add a new action again and select the custom action you have just created
