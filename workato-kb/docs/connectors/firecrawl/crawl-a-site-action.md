# Firecrawl - Crawl a site action

The **Crawl a site** action starts a crawl on a domain in Firecrawl and scrapes each page it discovers.

> **WAIT FOR COMPLETION**
> 
> This action submits the crawl by default, then polls every 60 seconds until the job's status is **completed** or **failed**. Select **No** for **Wait for completion** to return the job ID immediately instead, then use the [Get crawl job status](/en/connectors/firecrawl/get-crawl-job-status-action) action to check on it later.

## Input

The following input fields are the most commonly used. Refer to the Firecrawl [Crawl API](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/crawl-post) documentation for the complete list of input fields.

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| URL | Enter the absolute URL to crawl, for example `https://docs.firecrawl.dev`. |
| Prompt | Optional. Enter natural language to generate crawler options. Explicit fields you set override the generated values. |
| Limit | Optional. Enter the maximum pages to crawl. Costs one credit per page. The connector default is `10`. The Firecrawl API default is `10000`. Firecrawl returns a `402` error if **Limit** is higher than your remaining credits. |
| Include paths | Optional. Enter pathname regex patterns to include in the crawl, for example `blog/.*`. |
| Exclude paths | Optional. Enter pathname regex patterns to exclude from the crawl, for example `admin/.*`. |
| Crawl entire domain | Optional. Select **Yes** or **No** to follow sibling and parent internal links, not only child links. |
| Scrape options | Optional. Set formats and scrape options, such as **Only main content** or **Skip TLS verification**. This is applied to every page the crawl scrapes. Scrape options uses the same options as the [Scrape a page](/en/connectors/firecrawl/scrape-a-page-action) action. |
| Wait for completion | Optional. Select **Yes** or **No** to poll until the job finishes and returns the result. The default is **Yes**. |
| Max poll minutes | Optional. Enter the maximum minutes to poll. Valid values are 1-60. The default is `10`. This field is only available when **Wait for completion** is **Yes**. |
| Custom output fields | Optional. Add fields to create datapills for page data that the default output doesn't include. |

## Output
