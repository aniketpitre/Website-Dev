> The Workday connector lets you automate HR and finance workflows: read and update business and custom objects, run reports, and trigger on object changes.

# Workday

[Workday](https://www.workday.com/) offers cloud-based financial management and human capital management software. It combines finance and HR functionalities, enhancing business performance and providing deeper insights into organizational data.

Workday provides three primary types of services for data orchestration:

- Workday Web Services
  
- Provides a set of Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) APIs that enable users to read and write data in and out of Workday.
  
- Workday REST
  
- Offers REST APIs primarily used for manipulating custom objects.
  
- Workday Report-as-a-Service (RaaS)
  
- Allows you to extract data from custom reports that are web service enabled.
  

Workato uses these services to create powerful integration scenarios and sync data between your Workday instance and other cloud applications.

## Workday Approved

## API version

Workato supports the following versions for each of Workday's services:

### Workday Web Services

#### Supported versions

- v46.1
- v45.1
- v44.1
- v42.1

#### Version support policy

- Workato primarily supports even-numbered major version releases (for example, 42 and 44), following Workday's schedule of releasing one major version every six months. However, Workato may support odd-numbered versions when critical functionality isn't available in even-numbered releases. For example, Workday API v45 is supported to enable multiple concurrent jobs for contingent workers.
- Workato generally supports up to three API versions at any given time. In some cases, additional versions may be temporarily supported to accommodate customer requirements or ensure a smooth transition between releases. All connections using removed versions are automatically upgraded to the oldest available version. For example, if versions 42, 44, and 45 are supported and version 46 is added, version 42 may be removed, leaving 44, 45, and 46.
- Workato applies enhancements and bug fixes only to the latest supported version. Previous versions are offered as-is and don't receive updates.
- Workato intends to follow this approach but may adjust support coverage if the annual release cycle doesn't align with customer needs.

### Workday REST

- v1

### Workday Report-as-a-Service (RaaS)

There are no versions associated with the Workday RaaS.

## How to connect to Workday on Workato

### Before connecting to Workday

We recommend that you create an [Integration System User (ISU)](/en/connectors/workday#register-integration-system-user-isu-in-workday) before you integrate your Workday with Workato. An ISU ensures that all integration operations are logged under a designated user, separate from regular workflow processes. This is essential as changes to a regular worker’s security profile or their termination could disrupt integrations reliant on their account. Limit each ISU to a single integration system, such as Workato, for enhanced security.

The Workday REST API requires authentication through an OAuth client setup. You must register a Workday [API client](#register-api-client) if your integration includes Workday **custom objects**.

### Register Integration System User (ISU) in Workday

Your Integration System User (ISU) must be assigned the required permissions to create a successful integration. You may receive a `403` error if your ISU has insufficient permissions.

![403 error](/assets/permission-error-updated.DU_qX7h4.png)_Error message when ISU doesn't have enough permissions_

A `403` error may indicate that the ISU lacks the required domain-level permissions. Refer to the [Grant domain access to security group](#grant-domain-access-to-security-group) section to ensure that your ISU is granted the appropriate permissions.

#### Create an Integration System User (ISU)

Complete the following steps to create an ISU in Workday:

1. Type **Create Integration System User** into Workday's search bar and select the task from the results.
   
   ![Search for Create Integration System User task in Workday](/assets/search-isu-task.CvD1cTHm.png)_Search for **Create Integration System User** task in Workday_
   
2. Enter a username and set a password in the **Create Integration System User** task.
   
   > **ISU USERNAMES**
   > 
   > Spaces in Workday ISU usernames can cause encoding and formatting issues. We strongly recommend that you use underscores (`_`) or hyphens (`-`) instead of spaces.
   
   ![Create integration system user](/assets/create-isu.COdXMj8O.png)_Create Integration System User_
   
3. Set **Session Timeout Minutes** to `0` to prevent the ISU from timing out.
   
4. Ensure that the **Do Not Allow UI Sessions** checkbox isn't selected.
   
5. Go to the **Maintain Password Rules** task.
   
6. Exempt the integration system user from password expiration by adding them to the **System Users exempt from password expiration** field.

### Setting up the connection to Workday

The Workato Workday connector is categorized into three distinct types: the main Workday connector, the Workday Web Services connector, and the Workday REST connector. Each type follows a similar authentication pattern but differs slightly in support capabilities and functionalities.

#### Connection setup using OAuth 2.0 authentication

Complete the following steps to configure your Workday connection in Workato using OAuth 2.0 authentication:

OAuth 2.0 authentication is required if you plan to work with the Workday REST API or custom objects. We recommend that you avoid using the deprecated **Hybrid** authentication method.

1. Enter a unique **Connection name** to identify your Workday account in Workato.
   
   ![Workday connection](/assets/workday-connection-setup-oauth.rU2iQ_Y6.png)_Label your connection_
   
2. Use the **Location** drop-down to select the project or folder to store this connection.
   
3. Choose **OAuth 2.0** as the **Authentication type**. This method is required for working with custom objects and for querying data using Workday Query Language (WQL) with the Workday REST API.
   
4. Select the **Workday web services version** appropriate for your Workday tenant. We recommend choosing the newest version available for access to the latest features and updates.
   
5. Locate and enter your **Tenant ID**. You can find your tenant ID in your Workday URL. For example, your tenant ID is `sample_company` if your URL is `https://impl.workday.com/sample_company/d/home.htmld`.
   
6. Provide the **WSDL URL** associated with your Workday services.
   
7. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your API client settings.
   
8. Provide your **Refresh token** if using an API client for integrations.
   
9. Enter your **Authorization endpoint** and **Token endpoint** from your API Client settings to complete the OAuth flow.
   
10. Select the **Workday tenant timezone** that matches your Workday tenant's settings. Workday uses Pacific Standard Time (PST) by default.
    
11. Click **Advanced settings** to configure the **Advanced XML payload for multiple ID values**.
    
    Workato wraps each value in fields with multiple values within its own container by default when constructing the XML from your input.
    
    For example:
    
    ```
    <languages><language>english</language></languages><languages><language>chinese</language></languages>
    ```
    
    Workato unwraps these values and presents them in a single container if you set the value to **Yes**:
    
    ```
    <languages><language>english</language><language>chinese</language></languages>
    ```
    
    Consider enabling this when you encounter invalid payload errors.
    
12. Review the information you entered to ensure it is correct.
    
13. Click **Connect** to initiate the authorization process and complete the connection setup.
    

#### Connection setup using basic authentication

Complete the following steps to set up your Workday connection in Workato with basic authentication:

1. Enter a unique **Connection name** to identify your Workday account in Workato.
   
   ![Workday connection](/assets/workday-connection-setup-basic-updated.B1rcozBp.png)_Label your connection_
   
2. Use the **Location** drop-down to select the project or folder to store this connection.
   
3. Select **Basic** as the **Authentication type**. This method uses your Workday username and password for integration.
   
4. Locate and enter your **Tenant ID**. You can find your tenant ID in your Workday URL. For example, your tenant ID is `sample_company` if your URL is `https://impl.workday.com/sample_company/d/home.htmld`.
   
5. Provide the **WSDL URL** associated with your Workday services.
   
6. Provide your Workday **Login name** and **Password**.
   
7. Select your **Workday tenant timezone** that matches your Workday tenant's settings. Workday uses Pacific Standard Time (PST) by default.
   
8. Click **Advanced settings** to configure the **Advanced XML payload for multiple ID values** if required. Fields with multiple values are wrapped within a container by default. Set this option to `yes` to unwrap the values.
   
9. Review the information you entered to ensure it's correct.
   
10. Click **Connect** to initiate the authorization process and complete the connection setup.
