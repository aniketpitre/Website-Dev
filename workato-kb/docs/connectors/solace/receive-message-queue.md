# Solace - Receive message from queue action

The **Receive message from queue** action receives a single message from a `Solace` queue you specify.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Queue name | Select a queue, or toggle to enter it manually. |
| Message format | Select the message format. Options are **Binary** and **Text**. |
| Timeout (ms) | Optional. Enter the maximum wait time for a message, in milliseconds. The minimum value is `1` and the maximum is `300,000`. Defaults to `30,000`. |
| Selector | Optional. Enter a filter expression to select specific messages. For example, `property='value'`. Property names are case-sensitive. |
| Manual acknowledgement | Optional. Specify whether to hold the message until the **Acknowledge message** action settles it. Defaults to `No`, which acknowledges the message as soon as its output is produced. The job persists and you can rerun it, but the broker won't redeliver the message. |
| Acknowledgement timeout (ms) | Optional. Enter the number of milliseconds to wait for the **Acknowledge message** action before the message is redelivered. Solace treats the message as failed, redelivers it to the queue for a future receive attempt, and fails the original acknowledgement if the recipe doesn't finish acknowledging within this window. Defaults to `30,000`. |
