# Solace - New message in queue trigger

The **New message in queue** trigger monitors a `Solace` queue for new messages.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Queue name | Select a queue to monitor. |
| Message format | Select a message format. Options are **Binary** and **Text**. |
| Manual acknowledgement | Optional. Select whether to hold each message until the recipe settles it with the **Acknowledge message** action. Defaults to `No`, which acknowledges each message as soon as its trigger event is created. The job persists and you can rerun it, but the broker won't redeliver the message. |
| Acknowledgement timeout (ms) | Optional. Enter the number of milliseconds to wait for the **Acknowledge message** action before the message is redelivered. Solace treats the message as failed and redelivers it, spawning a duplicate job, and failing the original acknowledgement if the recipe doesn't finish acknowledging within this window. Defaults to `30,000`. |
