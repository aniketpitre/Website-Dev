# Salesforce - New record trigger (real-time)

This trigger monitors Salesforce in real-time for newly created objects.

## Input

| Input fields | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Object | Select the object type to monitor. |
| Fields to retrieve | Select the fields to retrieve from the object. Workato retrieves all fields by default. Entering specific fields to retrieve improves recipe performance and mitigates [schema errors](/en/connectors/salesforce/troubleshoot-runtime#schema-errors). |
| When first started, this recipe should pick up events from | Set the date and time to start picking up trigger events. This enables your recipe to capture past events. Refer to [Triggers](/en/recipes/triggers#since-from) to learn more about this input field. |

### Configuration in Salesforce

Complete the following steps to configure the trigger in Salesforce:

1. Refer to the [Input](#input) section to configure the input fields for this trigger. Workato generates an endpoint URL in the collapsible **HELP** section based on the **Object** you select and the connected Salesforce organization.
   
2. Copy the endpoint URL. This URL tells Salesforce to send real-time events about relevant objects to this Workato recipe.
   
   > **WARNING**
   > 
   > This endpoint URL is unique to the selected object and connected Salesforce organization. You must regenerate this endpoint URL if the object or Salesforce connection changes.

3. Use the endpoint URL to configure a [new outbound message in Salesforce](/en/connectors/salesforce/real-time-triggers#configure-a-new-outbound-message-in-salesforce) for the object type this trigger monitors.
   
4. Go to **Setup > Process Automation > Flows** in your Salesforce organization and click **New Flow**. The Salesforce flow setup wizard opens.

6. Select the Salesforce object type to monitor. In `Configure Trigger` select `A record is created`. In `Optimize the Flow for` select `Actions and Related Records`.
   
   > **WARNING**
   > 
   > Do not set any entry conditions as this conflicts with the backup polling mechanism in place.

7. In the Flow Builder view, click **+** (add element) and select `Action`.
   
8. Go to the **Outbound Message** tab.
   
9. Select the Outbound Message that you previously configured for this trigger.
   
10. Click **Done**, then **Save**.

12. Click **Activate**.

13. Return to Workato and start the recipe.
    

You can test that the recipe is working by causing a trigger event in Salesforce while the recipe is active. Workato creates a new job immediately if the Salesforce flow and Workato trigger are configured correctly.

## Output

The output of this trigger varies based on your selected **Object** and **Fields to retrieve**. Refer to Salesforce's [Overview of Salesforce Objects and Fields](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_concepts.htm) guide for more information on available objects and fields.
