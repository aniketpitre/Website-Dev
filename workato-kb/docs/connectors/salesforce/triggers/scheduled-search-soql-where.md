# Salesforce - Scheduled record search using SOQL query WHERE clause trigger (batch)

This trigger searches Salesforce using a SOQL query WHERE clause on a schedule you specify and returns the results in batches.

> **SELECT CLAUSE IN SOQL**
> 
> SOQL queries don't support the `SELECT *` operation often used in SQL queries. You must specify specific fields to retrieve in the SELECT clause.

## Input

| Input fields | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Object | Select the type of Salesforce object to search for. |
| SOQL WHERE clause | Enter a SOQL query to filter records by. For example: `StageName = 'Closed Lost' AND IsClosed = false` |
| Schedule | Select how often to search Salesforce. |
| Time zone | Select a time zone for the schedule. |
| Hour | Enter the hour to search Salesforce. This field uses 24-hour format, for example: `11` for 11am or `23` for 11pm. Defaults to `00` (12am). |
| Minute | Enter how many minutes past the hour to search Salesforce in double digit format. For example: `01` for 1 minute past the hour. |
| Day of month | Enter a number between `1` and `31` to specify the day of the month to search Salesforce. Shorter months round this value down to the last day of the month. Defaults to `1`. |
| Sunday | Select whether to allow searches on Sundays. |
| Monday | Select whether to allow searches on Mondays. |
| Tuesday | Select whether to allow searches on Tuesdays. |
| Wednesday | Select whether to allow searches on Wednesdays. |
| Thursday | Select whether to allow searches on Thursdays. |
| Friday | Select whether to allow searches on Fridays. |
| Saturday | Select whether to allow searches on Saturdays. |
| Fields to retrieve | Select the fields to retrieve from the object. Workato retrieves all fields by default. Entering specific fields to retrieve improves recipe performance and mitigates [schema errors](/en/connectors/salesforce/troubleshoot-runtime#schema-errors). |
| Batch size | Enter the maximum number of records to contain in each batch. The default value for this field is `100` and the maximum is `2000`. Salesforce records with many custom fields require smaller batch sizes. |

## Output

| Output fields | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Range | The range of records retrieved in the current batch. |
| Scheduled time | The date and time scheduled for the search. |
| Total number of objects | The total number of matching objects retrieved from Salesforce. |
| First batch | A boolean indicating whether the current batch contains the beginning of the results list. |
| Last batch | A boolean indicating whether the current batch contains the end of the results list. |
| Starting offset | The offset number for the first record of this batch. |
| Ending offset | The offset number for the last record of this batch. |
