# Salesforce - Scheduled records search using SOQL query trigger (batch)

This trigger searches Salesforce using a SOQL query on a schedule you specify.

> **SELECT CLAUSE IN SOQL**
> 
> SOQL queries don't support the `SELECT *` operation often used in SQL queries. You must specify specific fields to retrieve in the SELECT clause.
