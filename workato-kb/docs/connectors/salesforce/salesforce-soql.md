> Learn how to use Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) in the Salesforce connector for Workato to search records with WHERE clauses and operators.

# SOQL

You can use **Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL)** to search your Salesforce data for specific records. SOQL is similar to the `SELECT` statement in Structured Query Language (SQL), but is designed specifically for Salesforce data. The following Salesforce connector operations support SOQL:

**Actions:**

- [Search records using SOQL query](/en/connectors/salesforce/actions/search-records-soql-batch)
- [Search records in bulk using SOQL query](/en/connectors/salesforce/actions/search-records-soql)
- [Search records using SOQL query WHERE clause](/en/connectors/salesforce/actions/search-records-soql-where)

**Triggers:**

- [Export new records](/en/connectors/salesforce/triggers/export-new-records)
- [Export new/updated records](/en/connectors/salesforce/triggers/export-new-updated-records)
- [Monitor changes in a record](/en/connectors/salesforce/change-data-capture-trigger)
- [New platform event](/en/connectors/salesforce/triggers/new-platform-event)
- [New records](/en/connectors/salesforce/triggers/new-records-batch)

The following query shows the basic syntax of a SOQL query:

- `SELECT` (list of fields)
- `FROM` (an object)
- `WHERE` (filter statements and optional sorting)

Refer to the [Salesforce Fields Reference](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfFieldRef.meta/sfFieldRef/salesforce_field_reference.htm) for a list of standard fields for major Salesforce objects.

## SOQL WHERE conditions (Syntax)

The SOQL `WHERE` clause follows field expression syntax. A **fieldExpression** is defined as `<fieldName> <comparisonOperator> <value>`. The following sections show examples of valid SOQL `WHERE` queries.

### Comparison operators

The following list contains all SOQL comparison operators:

- `=`
- `!=`
- `<`
- `<=`
- `>`
- `>=`
- `LIKE`
- `IN`
- `NOT IN`
- `INCLUDES`
- `EXCLUDES`

The following example uses `fieldExpression` syntax with a valid SOQL comparison operator:

![Salesforce SOQL example 1](/assets/salesforce-soql-example-1.BBC3v4qE.png) _Example of using fieldExpression syntax with a comparison operator_

For detailed information on how to use each comparison operator, see [Comparison Operators](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql_select_comparisonoperators.htm).

### Logical operators

Multiple field expressions can be joined using logical operators. These include: `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`. The following list contains basic syntax for each operator:

- `fieldExpressionX AND fieldExpressionY`
- `fieldExpressionX OR fieldExpressionY`
- `NOT fieldExpressionX`

The following example uses two `fieldExpressions` joined by a logical operator:

![Salesforce SOQL example 2](/assets/salesforce-soql-example-2.DyvAYMPv.png) _Example of joining two fieldExpressions using a logical operator_

For more information on logical operators, see [Logical Operators](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql_select_logicaloperators.htm).

## Other SOQL clauses

- `LIMIT`: Limits the number of results returned in the search.
- `OFFSET`: Skips a specified number of rows before returning results.

The maximum value for both clauses is 2,000. Requesting an offset greater than 2,000 results in a `NUMBER_OUTSIDE_VALID_RANGE` error.

## Date formats and date literals

You must use formula mode to query a date or dateTime field. Formula mode converts your timestamp to the ISO8601 format expected in SOQL.

To filter on date fields in a query, you must use Date only format. The syntax for this is `YYYY-MM-DD`.

To filter on dateTime fields in a query, you must use a format including date, time, and time zone offset. There are three possible dateTime formats:

- `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm`
- `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss-hh:mm`
- `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ`

> **FORMAT FOR DATE AND DATETIME VALUES**
> 
> Single quotes around date or dateTime values are not required. For date fields, add `.to_date` at the end of your date formula to convert your date or timestamp to the correct format.

The following two examples demonstrate how to use `.to_date` in SOQL queries.

![Salesforce SOQL example 3](/assets/salesforce-soql-example-3.BINmPqoV.png) _Example of using .to\_date in a query_![Salesforce SOQL example 4](/assets/salesforce-soql-example-4.COWRJvSe.png)_Example of using .to\_date in a query_

For dateTime fields, the `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ` format is the preferred format to use in queries. After using the formula to get your desired timestamp, such as `now` or `2.weeks.ago.beginning_of_day`, add `.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z")` to the end of the query.

![Salesforce SOQL example 5](/assets/salesforce-soql-example-5.D_KBGWLj.png)_Example of using .strftime in a query_

For more information on date formats and date literals, see [Date Formats and Date Literals](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql_select_dateformats.htm).

## Triggers and actions that use SOQL

### Query with a WHERE clause

Use one of the following triggers or actions to set up a SOQL query where SOQL input is automatically configured using the fields you provide in the Workato UI. To quickly set up a SOQL query with the input configured using fields available in the Workato UI, use one of the triggers or actions below:

**Triggers**

- Scheduled record search using SOQL query `WHERE` clause

**Actions**

- Search records in bulk using SOQL query (API 1.0)
- Search records using SOQL query `WHERE` clause

When using triggers or actions that require a `WHERE` clause, the recipe automatically handles the `SELECT FROM` portion of your query. The recipe uses the object you chose in the **Fields to retrieve** picklist to `SELECT` all fields `FROM` the object.

You can also specify values for the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` fields, if available. The `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` fields are not supported in bulk actions.

#### Escape special characters

Salesforce marks a query as malformed if the SOQL WHERE clause contains unescaped `"` or `'` characters. You can add a backslash (`\`) before the special character to escape it. For example, `O\'glenn Johnson`.

You can also use the `gsub` function in Ruby to replace specific characters. For example:

```ruby
gsub(/'/, "\\:'").gsub(/:/, "")
```

### Query with a full SOQL query

To use a full SOQL query in Workato, use one of the triggers or actions below:

**Triggers**

- Scheduled record search using SOQL query

**Actions**

- Search records in bulk using SOQL query (API 2.0)
- Search for records using SOQL query

## Use a full SOQL query

The following example shows a SOQL query for the **Search records in bulk using SOQL query (API 2.0)** or **Search for records using SOQL query** actions.

![Salesforce SOQL example 6](/assets/salesforce-soql-example-6.D8ga0YBs.png)_Example SOQL query for actions_

To generate the output schema, select **Use SOQL**. Use the same SOQL that you entered in the **SOQL Query** field in the **Provide SOQL Query** field. In the **Review data** stage of the **Output schema** section, the query runs and returns sample rows. Select **Generate schema** to generate the output schema.

![Salesforce SOQL example of generating schema](/assets/soql-generate-schema.kj8Y1IxH.png)_Example of generating schema_

In subsequent recipe steps, the SOQL query output is accessible in the data tree.

> **MAXIMUM LENGTH OF SOQL QUERY**
> 
> The maximum length of a SOQL query is 16,000 characters.
> 
> SOQL queries that exceed this length trigger a `Connection reset by peer` error. You can shorten the query to prevent the error.
