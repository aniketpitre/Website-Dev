## Input

| Input fields | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Object | Select the standard or custom object type to create. |
| Batch size | Enter the number of records to process in each batch. The minimum value is `1`, the maximum and default is `200`. |
| Advanced configuration | Select whether to roll back records if an operation fails. Refer to the [Advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration) section for more information. |

Additional fields load dynamically based on the selected object. Use these fields to enter a source list and configure the new records.

You can obtain a source list from various locations, such as a new CSV file in a file storage app, including Box, Amazon S3, and On-prem files. Refer to the [List management](/en/features/list-management) documentation for more information about list inputs.

### Advanced configuration

![Advanced configuration](/assets/batch-advanced-config.BZcKXtba.png)_Advanced configuration_

The **Advanced configuration** settings configure whether batch operations roll back when a record fails.

Workato processes records in batches of up to 200 records each. If a single record in a batch fails, the entire batch rolls back, while other batches remain unaffected.

For example, when processing 1,000 records, they are divided into 5 batches of 200 records each. If any record in the first batch fails, the entire first batch of 200 records rolls back. The remaining four batches proceed as normal.

The default and recommended setting is `No`. This allows successful records to remain processed. You can use additional logic in subsequent recipe steps to handle the failed records.

## Output

This action outputs two objects:

- **Successful records** contains information about records successfully created in Salesforce.
- **Failed records** contains information about records that encountered issues and were not created in Salesforce.

#### Successful records

| Output fields | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Salesforce ID | The internal Salesforce ID of the record created. |
| Success | Indicates whether a record was successfully created in Salesforce. |
| List size | The number of successfully created records. |
| List index | The position of each successfully processed record within a batch. |

Additional outputs load dynamically based on the selected object type.

#### Failed records

| Output fields | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Success | Indicates whether a record was successfully created in Salesforce. |
| Errors | An array containing the `Status code`, `Error message` and `Fields`. Use the information here to determine why the records failed. |
| List size | The number of records that failed and were not created. |
| List index | The position of each failed record within a batch. |

The Salesforce ID of the object is not available in **Failed records** because the record does not exist in Salesforce.

Additional outputs load dynamically based on the selected object type.
