# Salesforce - Upsert record action

This action searches Salesforce records using a field you specify as the primary key. If a matching record is found, it is updated. If a matching record isn't found, one is created.

## Input

| Input fields | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Object | Select the standard or custom object type to upsert. |
| Primary key | Select an external ID to use as the primary key. If multiple records match the provided primary key, the action throws an error. Refer to the [Primary key](#primary-key) section for more information. |
| On-behalf-of user email | Optional. Enter the email of a Salesforce user to impersonate. Contact your Workato Customer Success Manager to enable this field. This field only supports JWT connections. |

### Primary key

This action requires you to specify an `External ID` field as a primary key to uniquely identify each Salesforce record.

The `External ID` field is a custom field that has the `External ID` attribute. It contains unique record identifiers from a system outside of Salesforce. External ID fields must be custom text, number, or email fields.

If an `External ID` value you provide already exists in a Salesforce record, Workato updates that record. If no matching `External ID` exists in Salesforce, Workato creates a new record. This action throws an error if multiple Salesforce records match the provided `External ID`.

> **MULTIPLE PRIMARY KEYS**
> 
> You can’t use more than one primary key in a single operation. To handle scenarios where multiple fields identify a record, first perform a search action using one of the keys. Then, add a conditional action to check whether the number of results is greater than one.
> 
> If you need to search using two fields (for example, `Full Name` and `Account`), use a search action that includes both fields as filters. Then retrieve the results and use a conditional check to verify the number of matching records before updating or creating records.

> Create a primary key in Salesforce
> 
> Complete the following steps to create an `External ID` field to use as your primary key:
> 
> 1. Go to the Salesforce **Setup** menu and select the **Object Manager** tab.
>    
> 2. Select the object where you plan to add the custom field. For example, **Contact**.
>    
> 3. Go to the **Fields & Relationships** tab and select **New**.
>    
> 4. Select the **Data Type** for the custom field. This example uses **Text**.
>    
> 5. Click **Next**.
>    
> 6. Configure the following fields:
>    
>    - Field Label
>      
>    - Enter a label to use for displays, page layouts, reports, and list views. This example uses `Test id`.
>      
>    - Length
>      
>    - Enter the maximum length for the field. This example uses `25`.
>      
>    - Field Name
>      
>    - The **Field Name** is an internal reference for integration purposes, such as custom links, custom s-controls, and the API. Changing the **Field Name** may affect existing integrations. The **Field Name** can only contain alphanumeric characters. It must begin with a letter, cannot end with an underscore, cannot contain two consecutive underscore characters, and must be unique across all `Contact` fields.
>      
>    - Unique
>      
>    - Select the **Unique** checkbox to disallow duplicate values.
>      
>    - External ID
>      
>    - Select the **External ID** checkbox to set the field as the unique identifier from an external system.
>      
> 7. Click **Next**.
>    
> 8. Select the profiles to provide edit access for this field through field-level security. The field is hidden from all users if you don’t assign it to any profiles.
>    
> 9. Click **Next**.
>    
> 10. Select the page layouts to include this field in. Salesforce adds the field to the end of the first two-column section in each selected layout. The field doesn't appear on any pages if you don't select a layout.
>     
>     You can customize the page layout to change the location of this field on the page.
>     
> 11. Click **Save**. The custom field for the **Contact** object appears as an option in the **Primary key** drop-down menu in the Workato recipe editor.
>     
> 12. Return to Workato and use the **Primary key** field to select the new custom field.
