# Salesforce - Search records using SOQL query (batch)

This action retrieves a list of Salesforce records that match the SOQL query you provide. Each job can retrieve up to 2,000 records. The maximum length of the SOQL query is 16,000 characters. Refer to the [SOQL](/en/connectors/salesforce/salesforce-soql) guide for more information about SOQL.

> **SELECT CLAUSE IN SOQL**
> 
> SOQL queries don't support the `SELECT *` operation often used in SQL queries. You must specify specific fields to retrieve in the SELECT clause.
