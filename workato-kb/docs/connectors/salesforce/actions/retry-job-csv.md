# Salesforce - Retry bulk job for failed records from CSV file action

This action retries failed Salesforce jobs in bulk from a CSV file.

> **POLLING BEHAVIOR**
> 
> Recipes that contain an action with polling must be in a running state for asynchronous polling to function as expected.

This action is synchronous, meaning Workato waits for Salesforce to complete the bulk job processing before moving to the next recipe action.

Use this action after another Salesforce bulk action, such as [Upsert records in bulk from CSV file](/en/connectors/salesforce/actions/upsert-records-in-bulk-from-csv), to resubmit failed records as a new bulk job. Refer to the [Salesforce bulk operations](/en/connectors/salesforce/salesforce-bulk) guide for more information about bulk operations.

### Salesforce bulk jobs

Workato splits large CSV files into chunks and processes them as separate Salesforce bulk jobs to comply with Salesforce API size limits. Bulk operations output a `Salesforce bulk jobs` datatree that contains information about each chunk processed.

Workato includes the aggregated results across all bulk jobs at the top of the output, outside of the `Salesforce bulk jobs` datatree.
