# Salesforce - Upsert records in bulk from CSV file action

This action upserts Salesforce records in bulk from a CSV file and a primary key. Matching records are updated and new records are created if matching records aren't found.

> **POLLING BEHAVIOR**
> 
> Recipes that contain an action with polling must be in a running state for asynchronous polling to function as expected.

Refer to the [Salesforce bulk operations](/en/connectors/salesforce/salesforce-bulk) guide for more information about bulk operations.

> **API VERSIONS**
> 
> This action exists in both API v1.0 and API v2.0 versions. Workato recommends using the bulk API v2.0 for optimal performance. This version reduces the impact on Salesforce API quotas by batching records more efficiently.

> **RETRY FAILED RECORDS**
> 
> You can use the [Retry bulk job for failed records from CSV file](/en/connectors/salesforce/actions/retry-job-csv) action to resubmit failed records to Salesforce as a new bulk job.

## Input

| Input fields | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Salesforce object to upsert | Select the standard or custom object type to upsert. |
| Relationship fields | Optional. Select how to map the CSV data columns into Salesforce object fields. Relationship fields are required for polymorphic columns. Refer to the [Relationship fields](#relationship-fields) section for more information about this field or the [Salesforce API documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/relationship_fields_in_a_header_row__2_0.htm) for more information about polymorphic fields. |
| Primary key | Select an external ID to use as the primary key. Alternatively, you can use the drop-down menu to switch this field to **Enter primary key** and enter the API name of an indexed field. If multiple records match the provided primary key, the action throws an error. Refer to the [Primary key](#primary-key) section for more information. |
| CSV file input | Define the schema of the CSV files containing Salesforce bulk load data. Refer to the [CSV file](#csv-file) section for an example. |
| File contents (CSV file input) | Enter the contents of the file. You can obtain a File datapill from the [Download file](/en/connectors/salesforce/actions/download-file) action. |
| Column separator (CSV file input) | Use the drop-down menu to select the column separator to use. For example, comma (`,`) or pipe (`|`). |
| Contains header line? (CSV file input) | Select whether the CSV file content contains a header line. This tells Workato whether to skip the first line to avoid processing it as data. |
| Column names (CSV file input) | Enter information about the data columns in your CSV file. |
| Use CSV column names as Salesforce field names | Select whether to map CSV columns to Salesforce object fields automatically. This option requires a header containing column names matching the Salesforce object fields. |
| CSV to Salesforce object field mapping | Enter CSV column names and the Salesforce object to upsert in bulk. |

### Primary key

This action requires you to specify a primary key to uniquely identify each Salesforce record. The Salesforce bulk API supports both the `External ID` field and indexed fields, for example the internal Record ID, as primary keys.

The `External ID` field is a custom field that has the `External ID` attribute. It contains unique record identifiers from a system outside of Salesforce. External ID fields must be custom text, number, or email fields.

Use the drop-down menu to switch the **Primary key** field to **Enter primary key** and enter the API name of an indexed field to use it as a primary key.

The action's behavior while using an external ID and other indexed fields differ as follows:

| Input value | External ID | Indexed fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Match found | Updates record | Updates record |
| No match found | Creates record | `MALFORMED_ID:Id in upsert is not valid` error |
| No value | `MISSING_ARGUMENT:External_ID__c not specified` error | Creates records |

This action throws an error if multiple Salesforce records match the provided primary key.

> **MULTIPLE PRIMARY KEYS**
> 
> You can’t use more than one primary key in a single operation. To handle scenarios where multiple fields identify a record, first perform a search action using one of the keys. Then, add a conditional action to check whether the number of results is greater than one.
> 
> If you need to search using two fields (for example, `Full Name` and `Account`), use a search action that includes both fields as filters. Then retrieve the results and use a conditional check to verify the number of matching records before updating or creating records.

> Create a primary key in Salesforce
> 
> Complete the following steps to create an `External ID` field to use as your primary key:
> 
> 1. Go to the Salesforce **Setup** menu and select the **Object Manager** tab.
>    
> 2. Select the object where you plan to add the custom field. For example, **Contact**.
>    
> 3. Go to the **Fields & Relationships** tab and select **New**.
>    
> 4. Select the **Data Type** for the custom field. This example uses **Text**.
>    
> 5. Click **Next**.
>    
> 6. Configure the following fields:
>    
>    - Field Label
>      
>    - Enter a label to use for displays, page layouts, reports, and list views. This example uses `Test id`.
>      
>    - Length
>      
>    - Enter the maximum length for the field. This example uses `25`.
>      
>    - Field Name
>      
>    - The **Field Name** is an internal reference for integration purposes, such as custom links, custom s-controls, and the API. Changing the **Field Name** may affect existing integrations. The **Field Name** can only contain alphanumeric characters. It must begin with a letter, cannot end with an underscore, cannot contain two consecutive underscore characters, and must be unique across all `Contact` fields.
>      
>    - Unique
>      
>    - Select the **Unique** checkbox to disallow duplicate values.
>      
>    - External ID
>      
>    - Select the **External ID** checkbox to set the field as the unique identifier from an external system.
>      
> 7. Click **Next**.
>    
> 8. Select the profiles to provide edit access for this field through field-level security. The field is hidden from all users if you don’t assign it to any profiles.
>    
> 9. Click **Next**.
>    
> 10. Select the page layouts to include this field in. Salesforce adds the field to the end of the first two-column section in each selected layout. The field doesn't appear on any pages if you don't select a layout.
>     
>     You can customize the page layout to change the location of this field on the page.
>     
> 11. Click **Save**. The custom field for the **Contact** object appears as an option in the **Primary key** drop-down menu in the Workato recipe editor.
>     
> 12. Return to Workato and use the **Primary key** field to select the new custom field.

### Relationship fields

Salesforce uses relationships and relationship fields to associate data between two objects. For example, the `Account` and `Contact` objects have a relationship where each contact stores a reference to one account, while each account can link to many contacts. You can view all contacts associated with an account directly from the account record. Some objects have relationships to other objects of the same type. For example, the `Reports To` field for a contact is a reference to a different contact.

Relationship fields also allow polymorphic column mapping. Workato cannot infer this mapping automatically, so you must specify it manually. If you don't configure the **Relationship fields** input, no data maps into Salesforce.

To configure this field, select which column of the CSV file to pull data from for each field that you plan to write to in Salesforce. This action doesn't allow datapills or data transformation using formula mode as it streams the CSV file data directly into Salesforce. Refer to the [Salesforce object relationships](/en/connectors/salesforce/related-objects) guide for more information about object relationships or the Salesforce [CSV field header documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/datafiles_csv_rel_field_header_row.htm) for information about relationship fields in CSV headers.

### Salesforce bulk jobs

Workato splits large CSV files into chunks and processes them as separate Salesforce bulk jobs to comply with Salesforce API size limits. Bulk operations output a `Salesforce bulk jobs` datatree that contains information about each chunk processed.

![Salesforce bulk operation output datatree - list of bulk jobs](/assets/bulk-operation-datatree-array-of-jobs.CZCluW4m.png)_Salesforce bulk operation output datatree - list of bulk jobs_

Workato includes the aggregated results across all bulk jobs at the top of the output, outside of the `Salesforce bulk jobs` datatree.
