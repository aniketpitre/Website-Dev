# Slack - Triggers

## Requirements

You must create a Slack app and install it within your Workato workspace before you can begin building Slack recipes.

Complete the following steps to create a Slack app:

1. Go to [**Slack API** > **Your Apps**](https://api.slack.com/apps) and select **Create New App**.
   
2. Choose a name for your Slack app and select your workspace to create your app.

You must define at least one permission scope before you can install your app in your workspace. Slack automatically adds required permission scopes when you subscribe to events. Refer to the following section for more information on event subscriptions.

### Enable event subscriptions

For the trigger to pick up events, your Slack app needs to know where to send these events to. That's why the **New event** trigger comes with a target URL, generated after you enter an **Event name**. After your app sends events to your recipe's target URL, the recipe can take over and execute your recipe's actions.

Event names don't have to be unique in your Workato workspace. You can use the same event name in multiple Slack recipes. This allows you to trigger multiple recipes with the same event name using a single event.

Complete the following steps to enable event subscriptions:

1. Go to your Slack app page, locate the **Features** section, and click **Event Subscriptions**.
   
   > **SLACK APP ID**
   > 
   > Your Slack app page should look something like:
   > 
   > ```html
   > https://api.slack.com/apps/{your_app_id}
   > ```
   
2. Go to **Event Subscriptions** and click the **Enable Events** toggle.
   
3. Go to your Workato workspace and copy the target URL from your **New event in Slack** trigger.
   
4. Go to your Slack app page and paste the target URL into the **Request URL** field.
   
5. Click **Save**.

### Subscribe to bot events

Slack provides a list of bot events you can subscribe to and use to trigger your recipe.

In this example, customer success users are given the option to create a private channel between themselves and their customers whenever messages containing the word 'resolve' are posted in certain channels and direct messages (DMs). This example uses the following events as triggers:

- `message.channels`
- `message.groups`
- `message.im`

![Event subscription example](/assets/event-subscription-example.Bh2OSiFY.png)_An event is sent to the recipe when a message is posted to a channel, a private channel, or a DM_

Your Slack app must have permission scopes to use Event subscriptions. Slack automatically adds required permission scopes when you subscribe to events.

### Install your app

Slack automatically adds a permission scope to your app when you subscribe to at least one bot event. You can now install the app in your workspace.

## New event trigger (real-time)

The **New event** trigger detects all bot events in your connected Slack instance. Each new event trigger comes with a target URL, generated after you enter an **Event name**. This target URL is used to [enable event subscriptions](/en/connectors/slack/triggers#enabling-event-subscriptions).

### Input

#### Event name

Enter an **Event name** to generate a unique target URL for subscribing to bot events. The **Event name** should describe the events you're subscribing to.
