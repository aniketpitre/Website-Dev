# Upwind

[Upwind](https://www.upwind.io/) is a cloud security platform that provides runtime-powered protection. This connector allows you to automate security workflows by integrating Upwind's threat detection, vulnerability management, and configuration compliance data with the rest of your organization's systems.

This connector has the following capabilities:

- Create tickets in a service management application when new threat events are detected in a cloud security platform
- Sync new and updated configuration compliance findings to a governance, risk, and compliance application for audit tracking
- Enrich incident records in a SIEM application with vulnerability finding and SBOM package details to accelerate security triage
- Register image build and deployment events from a CI/CD pipeline tool in a cloud security platform to enable runtime-to-code traceability
- Trigger automated notifications in a messaging application when high-severity configuration findings or threat events are identified
