# Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Export new or new/updated records trigger (bulk)

This trigger activates when a record in Microsoft Dynamics 365 is created or updated. This trigger retrieves records in batches and streams them as a CSV.

> **DEPRECATION NOTICE**
> 
> Workato has deprecated bulk triggers across platform connectors. You can't add new bulk triggers to recipes. Existing recipes with bulk triggers continue to run unless you delete the trigger from the recipe.
> 
> For batch processing use cases, we recommend that you use batch triggers or other [batch processing features](/en/features/batch-processing) instead.

You can use this trigger in conjunction with the [Get object schema](/en/connectors/dynamics-crm/actions/get-object-schema) action to retrieve the name and schema of a specific object and copy it to a database or data warehouse.
