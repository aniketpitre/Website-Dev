> The Splunk connector enables you to automate monitoring and analytics workflows, running queries against real-time machine data from Workato recipes.

# Splunk

[Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) is software that enables monitoring, reporting, and analyzing of real-time data to deliver operational intelligence for security, IT, and business.

## Working with the Splunk connector

### Run query action

This action lets you run an ad hoc query in your Splunk instance, from a Workato recipe. We cover the input fields in this action in the following segments:

- [Output field list](#output-field-list)
  
- [Search query](#search-query)
  
- [Earliest/latest time](#earliest-latest-time)
  

#### Output field list

Every Splunk query has an expected response. When working with Splunk queries on Workato, you will need to define this response as output schema for the function being called. This output schema defined will be used to build the [output datatree](/en/workato-concepts#datatree-and-datapills) for the action. This datatree allows you to map the variables returned from the Splunk query in subsequent recipe actions.

There are 2 ways to define this output schema:

1. Add individual fields
2. Use sample JSON

##### 1\. Add individual fields

Select `+ Add new field` to bring up the following schema designer widget.

![Single field pop up](/assets/individual_field_pop_up.C3sDosAn.png)_Schema designer widget (Single field)_

Define the field name and type for each field returned from this search. Select `Add field` to update the output schema with this new field.

##### 2\. Use sample JSON

Select `generate from JSON sample` to bring up the following schema designer widget.

![Sample JSON pop up](/assets/sample_json_pop_up.tHfkJlpY.png)_Schema designer widget (JSON)_

If you have a sample JSON response for your query, you can simply paste it in the widget to generate the output datatree. The schema will be automatically generated into the Workato schema definition structure. An example JSON is as follows.

```json
{
  "category": "sales",
  "count": 63,
  "percent": 29.71
}
```

#### Search query

Provide the Splunk query to run here. Refer to the [Search Tutorial](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/SearchTutorial/Usethesearchlanguage) by Splunk for more details.

#### Earliest/latest time

Events stored in Splunk are saved together with its timestamp (time when the event occurred) as the default field `_time` in UNIX time notation. Search queries generally contain a time period `earliest` or `latest`, to search for events with timestamp beginning/ending, or between the specified timestamps.

Refer to the [Time Modifiers Documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/6.6.3/SearchReference/SearchTimeModifiers) by Splunk for more details.
