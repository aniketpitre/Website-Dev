# Azure DevOps

[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) provides version control, work item tracking, pipelines, and release management for software development teams. The Azure DevOps connector lets you work with Azure DevOps projects, boards, builds, and pipelines in Workato.

This connector supports the following objects:

- Project
- Board
- Board columns
- Build
- Build log
- Run
- Work item

## API version

The Azure DevOps connector uses the [Azure DevOps API v6 and later](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/concepts/rest-api-versioning?view=azure-devops). Previous versions may be compatible, but Workato has not tested earlier versions.

## Install Azure DevOps from the community library

1. Open the recipe editor and search for a connector. Alternatively, you can search for a connector in the [community library](https://www.workato.com/browse/connectors).

## Connection setup

The Azure DevOps connector supports the following authentication types:

- [Authorization code grant](#auth-code-grant)
- [Personal access token](#pat-auth)
- [Service principal](#service-principal-auth)

### Authorization code grant authentication

You can use authorization code grant authentication to create an Azure DevOps connection in Workato. Use this method when you want recipes to run with a specific user's permissions, or when you want users to authorize Workato through a browser consent flow.

To use OAuth 2.0, you must first register an application and configure it to access Azure DevOps.

#### Azure DevOps setup

Complete the following steps to set up Azure DevOps for authorization code grant authentication:

1. Sign in to your [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that has permission to register applications in your Microsoft Entra tenant.
   
2. Go to **Microsoft Entra ID > App registrations**, then click **New registration**.
   
3. Enter a name for your application in the **Name** field.
   
4. Enter supported tenants that can use this application in the **Supported account types** field.
   
5. Select `Web` and enter `https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback` in the **Redirect URI** field.
   
6. Click **Register**.
   
7. Copy and save the **Application (client) ID** and the **Directory (tenant) ID** from the On the application's **Overview** page. You need these values to configure the Workato connection.
   
8. Select **Certificates & secrets > New client secret**. Enter a description and expiration, then click **Add**.
   
9. Copy and save the **client secret** for use in Workato. The secret is only displayed once.
   
10. Select **API permissions > Add a permission**.
    
11. Select **Azure DevOps > Delegated permissions**. Select the `user_impersonation` scope. Select additional scopes as needed for your Azure DevOps instance.
    
12. Click **Add permissions**. Click **Grant admin consent** if your tenant requires admin consent.

### Service principal grant authentication

You can use a service principal OAuth 2.0 grant to create an Azure DevOps connection in Workato.

Service principals and managed identities authenticate to Azure DevOps as a non-human identity, using Microsoft Entra ID. Use this method for production workflows, scheduled jobs, or recipes that should run without a specific user's credentials.

> **REQUIRED PERMISSIONS**
> 
> Adding service principals or managed identities to an Azure DevOps organization requires Project Collection Administrator permissions.

6. Go to **Certificates & secrets > New client secret**.
   
7. Copy and save the **Application (client) ID**, **Directory (tenant) ID**, and the secret **Value** for use in Workato.
   
8. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization at `https://dev.azure.com/{your_organization}`.
   
9. Go to **Organization settings > Users**, then click **Add users**.
   
10. Enter the display name of the service principal in the **Users or service principals** field.
    
11. Enter the access level you plan to grant in the **Access level** field. Select **Basic** for full Azure DevOps functionality.
    
12. Add the projects the identity can access in the **Add to projects** field.
    
13. Select **Project Contributors**, or another group that grants the required permissions, in the **Azure DevOps groups** field.
