# Active Directory - Search group action (Batch)

The **Search group** batch action retrieves a list of Active Directory groups matching the criteria you specify and processes them in batches.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Sample group DN | Specify the distinguished name (DN) of a reference group. The action uses this group’s attributes as a template to define sub-fields in the **Search groups by** field and retrieve values from matching groups. |
| Limit | Enter the maximum number of entries you plan to retrieve each trigger event. The maximum value is 1,000 entries. |
| Batch size | Optional. Enter the maximum number of entries to return in each batch. Defaults to `1000`. |
| Batch cookie | Optional. Enter the `Batch cookie` value from a previous iteration of this action to retrieve the next batch of results. Leave this field blank to retrieve the first batch. |
| Search groups by | Enter values for each attribute you plan to filter by. Only groups that match all the provided values are processed. This field includes sub-fields for each attribute of the reference group. |
| Advanced search filter | Enter [LDAP filters](https://ldap.com/ldap-filters/) to define search conditions. For example, enter `(ou=Dev)(objectClass=Group)` to retrieve only `Group` objects from the `Dev` organization unit. |

## Output

| Output field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Batch cookie | A pagination token for the next batch of results. |
| Groups | Contains groups that match your search criteria, including values for each attribute defined by the sample group. |
