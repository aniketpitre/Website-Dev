# Amazon SES

[Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) is an email platform that provides an easy, cost-effective way for you to send and receive email using your own email addresses and domains.

The Amazon SES connector lets you use workflows like auto-responders, email unsubscribe systems, and applications that generate customer support tickets from incoming emails.

## How to connect to Amazon SES on Workato

Workato supports the following authentication methods for Amazon SES:

- [IAM role ARN authentication](#iam-role)
- [Access Key ID authentication (Deprecated)](#access-key)

> **IAM ROLE AUTHENTICATION**
> 
> Workato recommends that you provision a dedicated integration role for this Workato connection. This helps to maintain permission boundaries, including controlled access and actions that are permitted by the third-party application (for example, Workato).
> 
> Refer to the Amazon documentation to learn how to [create an IAM User](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html).

### Permissions

When you create an IAM user and IAM role in Amazon SES, Workato performs operations in your Amazon SES user. To use the full set of Amazon SES connector actions, the IAM User must have `FullAccess` permissions to SES.

Example ARN Policy: `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSESFullAccess`.
