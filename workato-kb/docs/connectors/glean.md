> The Glean connector lets you automate enterprise search workflows: create, update, delete, search, and get records to power knowledge retrieval.

# Glean

[Glean](https://app.glean.com/) is an AI-driven platform that consolidates company data, personalizes information retrieval based on user context, and streamlines the search process to enhance productivity.

## Prerequisites

To connect to Glean in Workato, ensure you have the following:

- An active Glean instance
- Appropriate permissions to access Glean APIs. If you do not have a Glean account with the required permissions, contact your app administrator.

### Create an API Token

Complete the following steps to [create an API token](https://developers.glean.com/docs/client_api/client_api_scopes/#glean-issued-tokens) in the Glean admin console:

1. Sign in to Glean with an admin account.
   
2. Click on the wrench icon in the navigation bar to open the **Admin console**.
   
3. Go to **Setup** and select **API Tokens**.
   
4. Go to the **Client Tokens** or **Indexing tokens** tab, depending on which API you are using. This tab contains token metadata. The token itself isn't visible yet.
   
5. Click **Add New Token** to create a new token.
   
6. Define the token's **Description**, **Permissions**, **Scopes**, and **Expires** fields, then click **Save**. ![The Glean token's definition fields](/assets/glean-key.jmDotUoU.png)_The Glean token's definition fields_
   
7. Copy and save the token for use in Workato. The newly created token is only visible once after its creation and you can't retrieve it later.
