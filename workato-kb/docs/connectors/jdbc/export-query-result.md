## Input

### SQL

First, you must enter into the field a table to export from. If you are having trouble finding a table, you can change the action to select rows and find a value from the table section there. After a valid table is entered, it should be limited by something such as select so it can be exported to a file.

### Column delimiter

For the column delimiter, you can choose between several options to separate the table. CSV files typically use comma.

### Upload URL

This is the CSV file that the result of the query is going to be exported to. You can generate this url using [On-prem files](/en/connectors/on-prem-files/generate-on-prem-file-url) or [Amazon S3](/en/connectors/s3/action-presign-url).
