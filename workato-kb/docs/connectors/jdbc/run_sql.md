> The Run custom SQL (batch) action in the JDBC connector lets you run DML and DDL statements such as INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, CREATE, and DROP.

# JDBC - Run custom SQL action (batch)

The **Run custom SQL** batch action executes SQL commands on a JDBC source. This includes Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `SELECT`, and `DELETE`, and Data Definition Language (DDL) commands such as `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`.

> **1 MB QUERY SIZE QUOTA**
> 
> Starting 1 December 2025, the **Run custom SQL** action in this connector enforces a 1 MB query size quota. This change improves platform reliability, increases performance, and avoids large queries that overload database connections or impact upstream systems.

Workato returns a maximum of 50,000 in this action. For complex `SELECT` queries, use the [Select rows using custom SQL action](/en/connectors/jdbc/select#select-rows-using-custom-sql). This action requires OPA version 2.4.3 or later.

> **OPA REQUIRED**
> 
> Use this action with a connection that runs on the Workato on-prem agent. Refer to the [Connections using an on-prem agent](/en/on-prem/agents/connection) documentation for more information.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SQL | Enter a valid SQL string. You can include multiple SQL statements, separated by semicolons (`;`). However, only the result from the final statement returns. Use datapills to dynamically build SQL and ensure that you wrap datapills in single quotes (`''`). The query size is limited to 1 MB. |
| Execute update only SQL statement without row limit | Optional. Set this to **Yes** to run SQL statements without row limits. This option doesn't return any rows. Defaults to **No**. |
| Parameters | Define named parameters for your SQL query. Match each parameter to a placeholder in the SQL string. Provide a static value or map a datapill. Select the data type that matches what your database expects. Requires OPA version 2.7.3 or later. |
| Output fields | Define expected output columns for SQL queries that return rows, such as `SELECT` statements. Workato uses this schema to generate datapills. |

## Output

| Output fields | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Rows | List of rows returned from the SQL query. Workato defines these fields based on the **Output fields** input. |
| Rows affected | Integer that indicates how many rows the SQL statement affected. |

## Use SQL parameters

Use SQL parameters to provide values to your query at runtime. This approach prevents SQL injection and supports reusable, dynamic SQL.

For example, if you plan to retrieve customer records by ID:

```sql

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = :customer_id
```

Define a field named `customer_id` in the **Parameters** input and map it to a datapill. For example, a Customer ID (Step 6) from a Stripe step.

### Limitations

SQL queries that return rows are limited to 50,000.
