# On-prem files - New file in folder trigger

The **New file in folder** trigger monitors an on-prem folder for new files on a schedule you define. Each file is processed as a separate job. This trigger supports [streaming](/en/features/file-streaming) for transferring large files.

The trigger detects all existing files in the folder when you start the recipe for the first time. Only newly added files are processed on subsequent runs.

> **REQUIRED OPA VERSION**
> 
> This trigger requires an [on-prem agent](/en/on-prem/agents) version 2.4.2 or later.

## File renaming

This trigger appends a numerical ID and `.processing` to the names of processed files, for example: `sales_report.csv` is renamed to `sales_report.csv.1526632883663.processing`. This prevents the recipe from triggering on the same file in subsequent runs.

### How can I ignore older files?

You can exclude older files by using a [naming pattern filter](/en/connectors/on-prem-files#naming-pattern) or by manually moving older files to a different folder before starting the recipe.
