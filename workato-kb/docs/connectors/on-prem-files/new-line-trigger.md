# On-prem files - New line in CSV file trigger

The **New line in CSV file** trigger monitors an on-prem CSV file you specify for new lines.

The trigger detects all existing lines in the CSV file when you start the recipe for the first time. Only newly added lines are processed on subsequent runs. This trigger checks for new lines once every poll interval.
