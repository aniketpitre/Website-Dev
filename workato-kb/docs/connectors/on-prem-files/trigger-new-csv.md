> The New CSV file in folder batch trigger in the On-prem files connector picks up new CSV files added to an on-prem folder on a schedule you define.

# On-prem file trigger - New CSV file in folder trigger (Batch)

The **New CSV file in folder** batch trigger monitors an on-prem folder for new CSV files on a schedule you define.

The trigger detects all existing files in the folder when you start the recipe for the first time. Only newly added files are processed on subsequent runs.

Use this trigger when you have an on-prem folder to which you frequently add CSV files, such as weekly sales reports or daily data dumps from other systems. You can use this trigger to build a recipe that reads new CSV files and imports them into other systems, for example, Salesforce.

> **REQUIRED OPA VERSION**
> 
> This trigger requires an [on-prem agent](/en/on-prem/agents) version 2.10.2 or later.

## File renaming

This trigger appends a numerical ID and `.processing` to the names of processed files, for example: `sales_report.csv` is renamed to `sales_report.csv.1526632883663.processing`. This prevents the recipe from triggering on the same file in subsequent runs.
