# Azure Blob Storage

[Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/storage/blobs/) enables you to create data lakes for analytics and provides storage for building powerful cloud-native and mobile apps.

Azure Blob Storage enables you to store large amounts of unstructured object data. All Azure Blob Storage data is stored within containers. You must create a storage container before you can upload data with your Workato connection.

> **CONTAINERS ARE REQUIRED**
> 
> Log streams stop and Workato sends a notification email if you delete a container.

Workato's Azure Blob Storage connector allows you to automate cloud storage tasks and build data pipelines that automatically pull or push data to Azure Blob Storage from various apps.

## API version

The Azure Blob Storage connector uses the [Azure Blob Storage REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/blob-service-rest-api).

> **MICROSOFT MFA REQUIREMENTS**
> 
> Starting October 1, 2025, Microsoft will begin to enforce [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication?tabs=dotnet) for accounts that sign in to [Azure Resource Manager API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/control-plane-and-data-plane#control-plane) endpoints to perform Create, Update, or Delete operations.
> 
> These endpoints are used in the Azure Blob Storage connector to create and manage webhook subscriptions through `https://management.azure.com/subscriptions`.
> 
> This change affects the following triggers:
> 
> - [New blob trigger (real-time)](/en/connectors/azure_blob_storage/new-blob-trigger)
> - [New event trigger (real-time)](/en/connectors/azure_blob_storage/new-event-trigger)
> 
> Choose one of the following options to maintain uninterrupted service:
> 
> **Option 1: Enable MFA and re-authenticate**
> 
> 1. Set up MFA for your Azure organization following [Microsoft's MFA setup guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide).
>    
> 2. Reconnect your Azure Blob Storage connection in Workato.
>    
> 3. Complete the OAuth flow with MFA when prompted.
>    
> 4. Test the recipe to ensure it works with the connection.
>    
> 
> **Option 2: Migrate to Client Credentials authentication**
> 
> Configure a [Client Credentials Grant connection](#create-a-client-credentials-grant), which uses a service principal and is exempt from MFA enforcement.

## How to connect to Azure Blob Storage on Workato

There are two ways to authenticate to Azure Blob Storage:

- Using an [Authorization Code Grant](#create-an-auth-code-grant-isu)
- Using a [Client Credentials Grant](#create-a-client-credentials-grant)

### Create an Authorization Code Grant and Integration System User

Use an Authorization Code Grant connection to allow Workato to perform actions on behalf of a user by leveraging Integration System User (ISU) permissions. This setup is required to use Azure Blob Storage's capabilities, including the event webhook trigger.

> **NETWORK ACCESS REQUIRED**
> 
> Your Azure Blob Storage account must allow network access from Workato. You can enable public access from all networks or restrict access to specific IP addresses. If you restrict access, you must add [Workato IP addresses](/en/security/ip-allowlists#traffic-from-workato) to your allowlist.

> **ISU ACCOUNT ACCESS**
> 
> The ISU must have access solely to the storage account specified in your Workato connection.

Complete the following steps to create an ISU in your Microsoft Entra ID account:

1. Go to **Microsoft Entra ID**.
   
   ![Go to Microsoft Entra ID](/assets/nav-microsoft-entra.BLQ9IIbI.png)_Access Microsoft Entra ID from your Azure portal_
