> Gmail (Custom) uses a Google service account to manage Gmail settings and messages on behalf of a domain user.

# Gmail (Custom)

The [Gmail (Custom)](https://www.google.com/gmail/) connector uses a Google service account to manage Gmail settings and messages on behalf of a domain user. This connector supports actions to forward addresses, delegate, configure vacation responder settings, configure IMAP and POP settings, and enable Pub/Sub notifications for new messages. Each action specifies the mailbox to act on through a **User id** field, so a single connection can manage any mailbox the service account is authorized to impersonate.
