# TRADACOMS EDI - Parse TRADACOMS document (generic) action

The **Parse TRADACOMS document (generic)** action parses any TRADACOMS document in TRADACOMS EDI into an interchange structure that contains an STX header, MHD/MTR messages, and an END trailer. This action doesn't apply a schema. Use the **Parse TRADACOMS file (typed)** action to map named fields instead.

## Input

| --- | --- |
| TRADACOMS document | Enter the raw TRADACOMS EDI content, from `STX` through `END`. |
