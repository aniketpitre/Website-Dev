# TRADACOMS EDI - Generate TRADACOMS document (generic) action

The **Generate TRADACOMS document (generic)** action generates a TRADACOMS document from structured messages in TRADACOMS EDI. The action automatically calculates message numbers, MTR segment counts, and the END count.

> **THE ACTION ESCAPES SPECIAL CHARACTERS FOR YOU**
> 
> The action automatically escapes the TRADACOMS special characters `=`, `+`, `:`, `'`, and `?` in component values with `?` as the release character. Enter each value exactly as it appears in your data. To split a value across components, put each part in its own component instead of entering a colon in a single component value.
