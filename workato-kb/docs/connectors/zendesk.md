> Connect to Zendesk to manage customer support tickets, track engagement, and automate customer service workflows.

# Zendesk

[Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) is a cloud-based ticketing solution that empowers customer engagement and support management.

## API version

The Zendesk connector uses [Zendesk REST API v2](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/zendesk-apis/resources).

## Connection setup

The Zendesk connector uses OAuth 2.0 authentication.

> **DEPRECATED AUTHENTICATION METHODS**
> 
> Effective March 31, 2026, you can no longer create new Zendesk connections using Basic authentication or Custom OAuth profiles. This change is required by [Zendesk Developer Terms](https://www.zendesk.com/company/agreements-and-terms/zendesk-developer-terms/).
> 
> Existing connections using these authentication methods will continue to work until **April 30, 2027**. On this date, Zendesk connections still using Basic authentication or a Custom OAuth profile will be terminated, and recipes relying on these connections will stop functioning.
