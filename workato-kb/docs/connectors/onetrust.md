## Connection setup

The OneTrust connector supports the following authentication types:

- [Client credentials](#client-credentials-authentication)
- [API key](#api-key-authentication)

Both authentication types send a bearer token to OneTrust. The connection test reads assessments, so the credential must have read access to the Assessment Automation module.

### Client credentials authentication

Use client credentials to connect with a client ID and client secret. Workato exchanges them for an access token and refreshes the token when it expires.

#### Minimum and default scopes

Client credentials are scope-based, and the scopes required differ by endpoint. Select the scopes for the APIs you plan to use when creating your credentials. The connector uses the OneTrust Assessment APIs and the SCIM User APIs. Refer to the [OneTrust API](https://developer.onetrust.com/onetrust/reference/oauth-20-scopes) documentation for the scopes required by each endpoint.

#### OneTrust setup

Complete the following steps to set up OneTrust for client credentials authentication:

1. Click **Global settings > Access management > Client credentials** in OneTrust.
   
2. Click **Add** to create the credential.
   
3. Enter a name for your client credential. Optionally, configure **Restrict IP addresses**.
   
4. Configure **Scopes** for your client credential. Enable access to the OneTrust Assessment APIs and the SCIM User APIs. Refer to [Minimum and default scopes](#client-credentials-scopes) for more information about minimum scopes.
   
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret**.
