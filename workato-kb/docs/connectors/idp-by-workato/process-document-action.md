# IDP by Workato - Process document using IDP by Workato action

The **Process document using IDP by Workato** action extracts structured data from uploaded files using Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) by Workato. Extracted data appears as datapills.

Complete the following steps to set up your IDP by Workato action:

1. Search for `IDP by Workato` and select it as your connector action after you have set up your trigger.
   
   ![Choose app](/assets/select-idp-connector.D-_4llIo.png)_Choose IDP by Workato as your app_
   
2. Select **Process document using IDP by Workato** as your action.
   
3. Provide **File contents** to process.
   
   ![Process document action](/assets/idp-doc-processing.B74PMpvh.png)_Process document action_
   
4. Enter the **File name** with its extension or specify the type in **File type**.
   
5. Use the **File type** drop-down menu to select the file type to process. This overrides the inferred type from **File name**. This connector supports `png`, `jpg`, `webp`, `gif`, and `pdf` file types. PDF files can contain up to 50 pages with IDP model v4. Earlier versions support up to 15 pages.
   
6. Use the **IDP version** drop-down menu to select the version you plan to use. New versions are released regularly. The action uses the selected version until you manually update it. Refer to [IDP model versions](/en/connectors/idp-by-workato/idp-versions) for more information.
   
7. Use the **Document type** drop-down menu to select the document type to process. Select `Documents` to provide your own schema or select one of the following options to use a predefined schema:
   
   - `Invoices`
   - `Receipts`
   - `Passport`
   - `Driver's License`
   - `Academic Transcript`
   - `Contract`
   - `Purchase order`
8. Add your JSON schema or enter **Fields to identify** manually.
   
   **Add JSON schema**
   
   1. Click the **Use JSON** button under **Fields to identify**.
      
   2. Paste the JSON sample you plan to use into the code box and then click **Next**. Alternatively, you can upload your JSON code by selecting **Upload sample JSON from your device** from the drop-down menu.
      
      ![Add or upload JSON](/assets/idp-add-json.DyJx1yl8.gif)_Paste or upload your JSON schema_
      
   3. Click **Next** and then review your JSON.
      
   4. Click **Generate schema**.
      
   
   **Add fields manually**
   
   1. Click **Add fields manually** under **Fields to identify**.
      
   2. **Name** your field.
      
      ![Add fields manually](/assets/add-fields-manually.Dr-bDtBy.png)_Add fields manually_
      
   3. Optional. Add a **Description**.
      
   4. Select the **Data type**.
      
   5. Use the **Optional** drop-down menu to determine if the field is optional or not.
      
   6. Optional. Use the **Nested** drop-down menu to determine if the field is nested under another field.
      
   7. Click **Add field**.
      
   
9. Click **Save**.
   

## Output

This action returns extracted values and confidence scores. Extracted values contain structured data from the document, while confidence scores indicate the accuracy of the extracted values.

### Extracted values

Extracted values include key details from the document, such as invoice numbers, dates, line items, and total amounts.

### Confidence scores

Confidence scores indicate the model's confidence in the extracted values. A higher score (closer to 1.0) means greater accuracy.

## Example use cases

The input fields for this action vary depending on the document type. The following examples demonstrate how to configure the input fields for invoices and general documents.

### Process an invoice

Invoices contain structured data such as invoice numbers, dates, line items, and total amounts. This example shows how to configure the **Process document using IDP by Workato** action to extract key invoice details:

Example invoice configuration

The input fields in this example are based on the following invoice:

![Invoice example](/assets/invoice-example.5lokRQ-v.png)_Invoice example_

The invoice is uploaded to Workato FileStorage. Use the [Get file contents in Workato FileStorage action](/en/features/filestorage/get-file-contents-action) to retrieve it, then process it using the **Process document using IDP by Workato** action with the following fields:

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| File contents | The invoice file. This example maps the File contents datapill from the **Get File contents** action. |
| File name | Enter the file name with its extension or specify the type in **File type**. |
| File type | Specify the file type of the document. Supported formats include `png`, `jpg`, `webp`, `gif`, and `PDF`. This example uses `png`. |
| Document type | Set the document type to `Invoices`. |
| Fields to identify | Define the fields to extract from the file. |

### Process a general document

Documents may not follow a fixed structure like invoices. This example shows how to configure the **Process document using IDP by Workato** action to extract key details from an unstructured document.

Example document configuration

The input fields in this example are based on the following document:

![Document example](/assets/document-input-example.CGopj9kd.png)_Document example_

The document is uploaded to **Workato FileStorage**. Use the [Get file contents in Workato FileStorage](/en/features/filestorage/get-file-contents-action) action to retrieve it, then process it using the **Process document using IDP by Workato** action with the following fields:

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| File contents | The document file. This example maps the File contents datapill from the **Get file contents** action. |
| File name | Enter the file name with its extension or specify the type in **File type**. |
| File type | Specify the file type of the document. Supported formats are **png**, **jpg**, **webp**, **gif**, and **PDF**. This example uses **PDF**. |
| Document type | Set the document type to **Documents**. |
| Fields to identify | Define the fields to extract from the file. |
