# Amazon S3 - Upload file action (non-streaming)

The **Upload file** action (non-streaming) uploads a file to a bucket or folder in Amazon S3. If a file with the same name and path already exists in that location, uploading a new file overwrites the existing file.

> **WHICH UPLOAD ACTION SHOULD YOU USE?**
> 
> The **Upload file** non-streaming and [streaming](/en/connectors/s3/action-upload-file-streaming) actions both upload files, but they differ in how they process data and what they return.
> 
> - Use the non-streaming action for **smaller files** where you need a simple confirmation after the upload completes.
> - Use the streaming action for **larger files or continuous data streams**. This action processes the file in chunks and returns the file location instead. This method is better for handling large datasets, real-time processing, or incremental uploads. Learn more about [file streaming](/en/features/file-streaming).
