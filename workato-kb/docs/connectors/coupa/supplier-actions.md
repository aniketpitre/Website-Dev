### Input fields for supplier actions

You must define which supplier you plan to retrieve the supplier site data from. You can select a supplier from a list or generate the supplier dynamically with datapills from recipe output steps. You must select **Use custom value** if using datapills to ensure you use the Coupa internal supplier ID instead of the supplier name to avoid any unexpected behavior in your recipes.
