## API version

The Zoom connector uses [Zoom's REST API v2](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/).

## Connection setup

The Zoom connector uses OAuth 2.0 authentication.

### Zoom setup for OAuth 2.0 authentication

Complete the following steps to connect to Zoom in Workato with OAuth 2.0 authentication:

- [Add an API user](#add-an-api-user)
- [Create a custom OAuth profile](#create-custom-oauth-profile)
- [Connect to Zoom with OAuth 2.0 authentication](#connect)

> **RECOMMENDED SETUP**
> 
> We recommend that you set up a dedicated API user account in Zoom or create a custom OAuth profile to authorize Workato. This allows you to assign the API user to a role with only the necessary permissions.
> 
> Alternatively, you can use an existing Zoom owner or admin account if it has the required permissions. Some admin accounts may have restricted access based on their configuration.
