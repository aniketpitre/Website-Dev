# Dropbox - New file revision in Dropbox trigger

This trigger monitors a file in Dropbox, and triggers immediately when the file is updated (and a new file revision created).

If the filename is changed, updates will no longer be picked up. Picks up file revisions from a day ago when recipe is first started.

| Path | File path. |
| Bytes | File size in bytes. |
| Size | File size in string format. |
| Mime type | The Mime type of this file. |

| Rev | A unique identifier for the current revision of the file. |
| Modified | Date/time the file was last modified. |
| Client modified time | This is the modification time set by the desktop client when the file was added to Dropbox.
