# Dropbox - Move/Rename file action

This action allows you to move or rename the existing files in your Dropbox instance.

To rename a file/folder, change the file/folder name at the end of the path, for example, folder 1/file 1.docx to folder 1/file2.docx.

To move a file/folder, change the path to that file/folder, for example, folder 1/file 1.docx to folder 2/file 1.docx.

## Output

| Field name | Description |

| ID | ID of the file moved or renamed. |
| Name | The most current name of the file that was moved or renamed. |
| Path | The most current path of the file that was moved or renamed. |
| Is directory | Whether this is a directory/folder. |
| Rev | A unique identifier for the current revision of the file. |
| Bytes | File size in bytes. |
| Size | File size in string format. |
| Modified | Date/time the file was last modified. |
| Client modified time | This is the modification time set by the desktop client when the file was added to Dropbox.
