# Dropbox - Download file action

This action downloads contents of a file. The `File contents` output from this action can be used in subsequent steps of the recipe to upload the file into other applications.

The following image is an example of uploading a file using `File contents`. Here, we map `File contents` from the action `Download file` to the action [Upload file using file contents](/en/connectors/dropbox/action-upload-file).
