# Jina - Deep research action

The **Deep research** action runs a DeepSearch chat completion in Jina. The **Deep research** action reasons over a conversation, searches and reads web pages before answering a query.

> **STREAMING IS DISABLED**
> 
> This action waits for the full response. Keep **Reasoning effort** at the default setting, **Low**, to enable faster responses.
