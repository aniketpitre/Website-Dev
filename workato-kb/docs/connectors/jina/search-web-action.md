# Jina - Search web action

The **Search web** action searches the web with Jina and returns clean, LLM-friendly results in Jina.

> **MINIMUM TOKEN COST**
> 
> Each call uses at least 10,000 tokens, regardless of query size.

> **SHARED READER OPTIONS**
> 
> Most input fields on this action are also available in the [Read URL](/en/connectors/jina/read-url-action) action, because both actions send the same Jina Reader headers.
