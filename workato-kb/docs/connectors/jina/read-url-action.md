# Jina - Read URL action

The **Read URL** action fetches a URL with Jina Reader and returns clean content in Jina.

> **SHARED READER OPTIONS**
> 
> Most input fields on this action are also available in the [Search web](/en/connectors/jina/search-web-action) action, because both actions send the same Jina Reader headers.

## Input
