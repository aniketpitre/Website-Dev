> Connect TikTok to Workato to read creator profiles, list videos, and publish videos or photo carousels through TikTok's Content Posting API.

# TikTok

[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com) is a short-form video platform. The TikTok connector uses TikTok's Content Posting API and Display API to read a creator's profile and videos and publish posts in Workato.

Use the TikTok connector to:

- Get a user's profile or creator info.
- List a user's videos, or retrieve specific videos by video ID.
- Publish a video or photo carousel.

You can also use [custom actions](/en/developing-connectors/custom-actions) to build a custom HTTP request to any TikTok API endpoint. Refer to the [TikTok API](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-v2-introduction) documentation for endpoint details.

## Install TikTok from the community library

1. Open the recipe editor and search for a connector. Alternatively, you can search for a connector in the [community library](https://www.workato.com/browse/connectors).

## Connection setup

The TikTok connector uses OAuth 2.0 authentication.

> **UNAUDITED APPS CAN'T POST PUBLICLY**
> 
> TikTok requires direct posts from unaudited developer apps to use the **Only me** privacy setting. Submit your app for a TikTok app audit to publish public posts.

### Minimum and default scopes

The TikTok connector requests the `user.info.basic` scope by default. Leave the **Scopes** field blank to also request the following scopes:

- `user.info.profile`
- `user.info.stats`
- `video.list`
- `video.publish`
- `video.upload`

Select one or more scopes to replace this default set. The connection then requests `user.info.basic` and only the scopes you select. Select the scopes your recipes need, including any extra scopes for custom actions:

- `user.info.profile`
- `user.info.stats`
- `video.list`
- `video.publish`
- `video.upload`
- `local.product.manage`
- `local.shop.manage`
- `local.voucher.manage`
- `portability.activity.ongoing`
- `portability.activity.single`
- `portability.all.ongoing`
- `portability.all.single`
- `portability.directmessages.ongoing`
- `portability.directmessages.single`
- `portability.postsandprofile.ongoing`
- `portability.postsandprofile.single`
- `research.adlib.basic`
- `research.data.basic`
- `research.data.u18eu`
- `research.data.vra`

#### Add scopes and submit

Complete the following steps to add scopes and submit your app for review:

1. Verify the domain or URL prefix that hosts your media files under **URL properties**. Refer to [Verify a domain or URL prefix](#url-verification) for more information.

### Verify a domain or URL prefix

TikTok rejects media URLs that aren't on a domain or URL prefix you verified. The [Publish photo carousel](/en/connectors/tiktok/publish-photo-carousel-action) action requires verified URLs.

Add the domain or URL prefix under **URL properties** in your TikTok app and verify ownership before you submit the app for review. Refer to TikTok's [Media Transfer Guide](https://developers.tiktok.com/docs/en/content-posting-api-media-transfer-guide) for verification methods and detailed steps.
