# Twilio - Make phone call action

This action allows you to make an automated voice phone call. For example, if a trigger event occurs, the action makes a call to a phone number that you configure, and an artificial voice speaks aloud the message you provided. This option does not allow the call recipient to press a key on the dial pad to interact with the call.
