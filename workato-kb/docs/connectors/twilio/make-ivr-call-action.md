# Twilio - Make IVR phone call action

This action allows you to make an interactive voice response (IVR) phone call. For example, if a trigger event occurs, the action makes a call to a phone number that you configure, and an artificial voice speaks aloud the message you provided. You can configure key prompts to allow the person receiving the call to select options or provide a general response with the dial pad.
