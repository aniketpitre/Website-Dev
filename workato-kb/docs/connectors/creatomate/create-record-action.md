| Name | Name for the template. Must be a non-empty string so you can recognize it later. |
| Composition layers | Select the number of composition layers, from `1` to `3`, to show as input fields under **Source**. Only select more than one layer when an element's type is **Composition**. Pass deeper child elements as JSON if you need more than 3 layers. |
