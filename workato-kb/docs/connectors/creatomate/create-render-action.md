# Creatomate - Create render action

The **Create render** action creates a render from a template or from RenderScript, and waits until the render succeeds or fails in Creatomate. The action times out if the render doesn't finish in 60 minutes. Queued renders keep running and can be checked afterward with the [Get render status action](/en/connectors/creatomate/get-render-status-action).
