> The Get render status action enables you to retrieve the status of a render by ID in Creatomate.

# Creatomate - Get render status action

The **Get render status** action retrieves a render you specify, including the status, output URL, snapshot URL, file size, and error message if it failed. Use this action to check on a render after the [Create render action](/en/connectors/creatomate/create-render-action) has timed out, since queued renders keep running and complete later.
