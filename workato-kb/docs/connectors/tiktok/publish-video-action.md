> Publish a video to TikTok from a public URL or a file upload, as a direct post or a draft in the creator inbox.

# TikTok - Publish video action

The **Publish video** action publishes a video to TikTok. Select **Direct post** to publish immediately or **Upload to inbox** to send a draft to the creator inbox.

> **THE ACTION UPLOADS THE FILE FOR YOU**
> 
> Set **Source** to **File upload (stream)** to send a video file from your recipe. The action requests an upload URL from TikTok and streams the file to it in chunks, so you don't need a separate upload step.
