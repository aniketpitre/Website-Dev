# Gmail (Custom) - Create forwarding address action

The **Create forwarding address** action creates a forwarding address for a Gmail mailbox. Gmail sends a message to the recipient and sets the address's verification status to **pending** if ownership verification is required. The address is created with its verification status set to **accepted** if ownership verification isn't required. This action requires the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.sharing` OAuth scope.
