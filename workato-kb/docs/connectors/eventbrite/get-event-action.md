# Eventbrite - Get event attendees action (batch)

The **Get event attendees** [batch action](/en/features/batch-processing) allows you to retrieve a list of attendees for a specific event using the event's unique ID. The [Eventbrite API](https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api) typically limits the number of results to 50, but the actual number may be fewer if the attendee record has many custom fields.
