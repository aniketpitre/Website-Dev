# PDF tools by Workato - Extract text from PDF action

The **Extract text from PDF** action extracts raw, unstructured text from digital (machine-readable) PDF documents and returns the content page by page. Supported source PDFs include those created from Word, Excel, PowerPoint, web pages, or system-generated reports.

This action is commonly used to ingest PDF content into knowledge bases for AI agents or to prepare text for AI summarization.

> **Scanned PDFs and structured extraction aren't supported**
> 
> This action returns raw text only. It doesn't support scanned or image-based PDFs and doesn't extract data into a defined schema. To extract structured data, or to process scanned documents, use [IDP by Workato](/en/connectors/idp-by-workato) instead.
