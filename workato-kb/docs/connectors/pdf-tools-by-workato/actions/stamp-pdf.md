# PDF tools by Workato - Stamp PDF action

The **Stamp PDF** action adds text or image stamps as overlays on PDF pages while preserving the original content. You can use it to add invoice numbers, approval stamps, watermarks, or labels to PDF documents in your workflows.

> **Signed PDFs and PDF/A Compliance**
> 
> Stamping a signed PDF invalidates all signatures in the output file. Apply stamps before signing to keep signatures valid.
> 
> If the source PDF is PDF/A compliant (archival format), the stamped output no longer maintains PDF/A conformance.

This example recipe helps Finance teams track paid invoices. When a payment is completed, the recipe downloads the invoice PDF from Google Drive, applies a **PAID** stamp, and saves the stamped version back before archiving.

The recipe downloads both the invoice PDF and the **PAID** stamp image from Google Drive, uses the **Stamp PDF** action to overlay the stamp in the top-right corner, then uploads the result.

The following tabs show the invoice before and after stamping:
