# Azure Monitor - Send custom log action

The **Send custom log** action sends custom logs to Azure Monitor.

> **DEPRECATED - MIGRATION REQUIRED**
> 
> This action uses the [HTTP Data Collector API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-collector-api), which will be deprecated on December 8, 2025, and will stop working in September 2026.
> 
> We recommend that you migrate to the [Inject custom logs action](/en/connectors/azure-monitor/actions/inject-custom-logs). It uses the newer [Logs Ingestion API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-ingestion-api-overview) with [client credentials authentication](/en/connectors/azure_monitor#client-credentials).
