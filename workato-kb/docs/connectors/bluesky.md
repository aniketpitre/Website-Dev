> The Bluesky connector lets you post, message, and monitor notifications on the decentralized Bluesky social network in Workato.

# Bluesky

[Bluesky](https://bsky.app) is a decentralized social network built on the AT Protocol. This connector enables you to look up profiles, create and delete posts and threads, upload images, send direct messages, and monitor notifications, all with a free Bluesky account and an app password. A Bluesky app password is a specific password used to connect Bluesky with other apps. This is not the same password that you use to log into your Bluesky account.
