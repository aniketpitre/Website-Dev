# HubSpot - Associate records action (batch)

The **Associate records** batch action creates associations between records in HubSpot. If association types are left blank, it creates the default (most generic) association type between two object types. Note that the default association is available only for HubSpot main objects.

If you plan to use custom object associations, you must create a user-defined association definition and use it in association types. This action accepts a maximum of 2000 records and fails if more than 2000 records are provided.
