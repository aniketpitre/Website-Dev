# HubSpot - Delete contact action

The **Delete contact** action deletes a contact that matches the given contact ID or email from your HubSpot portal. If a contact with the same email address interacts with the portal again (through a form submission, for example), the contact is added back into the user interface.

> **WARNING**
> 
> Take extra precaution when using this action as deleted objects may be deleted permanently. We suggest that all delete actions be committed manually and under supervision.
