# HubSpot - Get owner details by ID action

The **Get owner details by ID** action retrieves all owners in a HubSpot account that match the ID you provide. You can select whether to retrieve archived owners in the results.

HubSpot uses owners to [assign](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/crm-setup/how-to-set-an-owner) specific users to contacts, companies, deals, tickets, or engagements. Any HubSpot user with access to contacts can be assigned as an owner, and multiple owners can be assigned to an object by creating a [custom property](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/crm-setup/manage-your-properties#create-custom-properties).

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ID | Provide the ID of the owner to retrieve details for. |
| Archived | Select **Yes** to return only results that have been archived. Default is **No**. |

## Output
