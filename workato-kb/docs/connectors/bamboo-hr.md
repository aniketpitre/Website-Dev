# BambooHR

[BambooHR](https://www.bamboohr.com/) is a HR software solution for collecting, maintaining, and analyzing your people data.

Review a BambooHR, QuickBooks Online, and Okta example recipe

Complete the following steps to create a recipe that monitors BambooHR for new employees. When activity is detected, it creates a new employee in QuickBooks Online and a new user in Okta.

This use case is intended to serve as an example. Recipe modifications such as trigger and action configuration and conditional logic may require adjustments if you plan to include this recipe in your own workflow.
