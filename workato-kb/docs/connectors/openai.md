> The OpenAI connector enables you to automate AI workflows, generating text and images, classifying text, and running models through the OpenAI API in Workato.

# OpenAI

[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) is an artificial intelligence research organization behind the popular ChatGPT, which interacts in a conversational way. OpenAI has multiple models you can leverage for editing text, generating images, and text classification. You can create your own models and expose them internally using OpenAI.

> **FEATURE AVAILABILITY**
> 
> The OpenAI connector isn't available to workspaces in the CN data center. This reflects local regulatory requirements and applies to our multi-tenant and [Virtual Private Workato (VPW)](/en/cloud-hosting-editions/hosting-editions#virtual-private-workato) offerings.

## API Version

The OpenAI connector uses the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction).

### API call rate limits

Rate limits for API calls are determined by your OpenAI plan. Refer to the [OpenAI rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits) documentation for more information.

## How to connect to OpenAI on Workato

The OpenAI connector uses an API key for authentication. Obtain the API key in OpenAI by navigating to the [OpenAI API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). We recommend that you store the API key safely, as it is only displayed once.
