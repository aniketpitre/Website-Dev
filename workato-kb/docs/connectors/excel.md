> Connect Excel to Workato to automate workflows with your workbook data.

# Excel

[Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel) is a spreadsheet software program and a powerful data visualization and analysis tool.

Workato's Excel connector enables you to read data from Excel workbooks stored in OneDrive for Business, SharePoint sites, or shared Group drives.

> **SQL TRANSFORMATIONS FOR EXCEL FILE SOURCES**
> 
> The Excel connector only supports working with files stored in [SharePoint](/en/connectors/sharepoint) and [OneDrive](/en/connectors/onedrive). For processing or transforming large-volume Excel files from other sources, such as [Google Drive](/en/connectors/google-drive) or [SFTP](/en/connectors/sftp), use [SQL Transformations](/en/features/sql-transformations).

## API version

The Excel connector uses the [Excel REST API v1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/excel?view=graph-rest-1.0).

## Connection setup

The Excel connector supports the following authentication types:

- [Authorization code grant authentication (OAuth 2.0)](#authentication-auth-code)
- [Client credentials-based authentication (OAuth 2.0)](#authentication-client-credentials): _Only available for tenant-specific connections_

> **MICROSOFT MFA ENFORCEMENT**
> 
> Microsoft is rolling out mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA) gradually to different applications and accounts in phases. This enforcement continues throughout 2025 and beyond. Refer to the Microsoft [Mandatory multifactor authentication for Azure and admin portals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication?tabs=dotnet) documentation for more information.
> 
> We strongly recommend enabling MFA now for all Microsoft accounts used with Workato to avoid service disruptions from short-notice enforcement changes.
> 
> Complete the following steps to maintain uninterrupted service:
> 
> 1. Enable MFA for your Microsoft organization following the Microsoft MFA setup guide. Refer to [Set up multifactor authentication for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide) for more information.
>    
> 2. Reconnect your Microsoft connection in Workato.
>    
> 3. Complete the OAuth flow with MFA when prompted.
>    
> 4. Test your recipes to ensure they work with the updated connection.

### Authorization code grant authentication (OAuth 2.0)

This authentication method requires the following value for tenant-specific account types:

- Tenant ID/Domain

#### Minimum and default scopes

The Excel connector requests the following scopes for authorization code grant connections by default. These scopes are necessary to use all of this connector's triggers and actions. Additionally, you must assign these permissions to the Workato app as **Delegated** permissions in the Azure portal.

| Permission | Description | Relevant action or trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Files.Read` | Allows the app to read the signed-in user's files. | Get cells, Get rows, List tables, List worksheets, and Search workbooks |
| `Files.ReadWrite` | Allows the app to read and write to the signed-in user's files. | All actions in `Files.Read` and Add a table, Add a worksheet, Add rows in batch, Delete row, and Update row. |
| `Group.Read.All` | Allows the app to read files for all groups the signed-in user can access. | Get cells, Get rows, List tables, List worksheets, and Search workbooks |
| `Sites.Read.All` | Allows the app to read documents in all SharePoint site collections on behalf of the signed-in user. | Get cells, Get rows, List tables, List worksheets, and Search workbooks |
| `Sites.ReadWrite.All` | Allows the app to read and write to documents in all SharePoint site collections on behalf of the signed-in user. On the consent page, this scope appears as the `Maintain access to data you have given it access to` permission. | All actions in `Sites.Read.All` and Add a table, Add a worksheet, Add rows in batch, Delete row, and Update row. Add this permission for all actions to preserve the connection's validity. |
| `User.Read` | Allows the app to sign in and read the profile of signed-in users. | Add this permission for all actions. |
| `offline_access` | Allows the app to access Microsoft Graph data after the user has signed out or the session has expired. | You must add this permission to establish a connection. |

To limit the connection to specific SharePoint sites instead of all sites, add the following scope:

- `Sites.Selected`

This scope doesn't grant your app access to any sites by itself. A SharePoint or Global admin must grant your app access to each site you plan to use. After access is granted, Excel actions can work with files on that site. Refer to [Grant site access for Sites.Selected](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-sharepoint#grant-site-access-for-sites-selected) for more information.

When you use `Sites.Selected`, file and table pick lists show only the files that the connected user can access.

You must add the following minimum scopes to establish a connection to Excel with authorization code grant authentication:

- `Files.Read`
- `offline_access`
- `User.Read`

#### Excel setup for authorization code grant authentication
