> The JDBC connector lets you work with any ANSI-compliant database: insert, update, delete, and select rows, run custom SQL, and trigger on new rows.

# JDBC

The JDBC connector enables you to connect to any ANSI-compliant database using a JDBC driver and Workato's on-prem agent. You can use it to integrate with systems that support JDBC and SQL.

## Supported databases

The JDBC connector supports any database that complies with ANSI SQL standards and provides a compatible JDBC driver. This includes databases such as **Snowflake** and **SAP HANA**. The database must support binding variables to use some actions such as **INSERT**.

## How to connect to JDBC on Workato

You must use an [on-prem agent](/en/on-prem) to connect to a JDBC source in Workato. The agent enables secure communication between your local database and Workato.

Refer to the [on-prem agent profile](/en/on-prem/agents/connection/profile#example-database-profiles) guide to learn how to connect to a JDBC-compliant database.

Complete the following steps to create a JDBC connection:

1. Provide a unique **Connection name** to identify your JDBC connection.
   
   ![Connect to JDBC](/assets/connect-jdbc.C1_cXxih.png)_Connect to JDBC_
   
2. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
3. Use the **On-prem group** drop-down menu to select the connection profile you plan to use.
   
4. Enter your **JDBC connection URL**.
   
5. Enter the **JDBC driver class name**.
   
6. Enter your database username in the **User name** field.
   
7. Provide a **Password** if your database requires username/password authentication.
   
8. Configure **Pooling settings** to control the number of open connections to your database.
   
9. Enter the **Schema** if your JDBC driver or database requires a specific schema to access tables and views.
   
10. Expand the **Additional properties for JDBC connection** section to display the advanced configuration fields. Use this section to add authentication keys or other custom JDBC parameters.
    
11. Click **Connect**.
    

### Snowflake connection using key-pair authentication

Use this method to connect to Snowflake through the JDBC connector using an on-prem agent and key pair authentication.

> **PREREQUISITES**
> 
> You must complete the following tasks before you create a Snowflake JDBC connection using key pair authentication:
>

## Working with the JDBC connector

### Table and view

The JDBC connector works with all tables and views available to the credentials used to establish the connection. These are available in pick lists in each trigger/action, or you can provide the exact name.

![Table selection from pick list](/assets/table_pick_list.CcR6ntMB.png)_Select a table/view from the pick list_

![Exact table name provided](/assets/table_name_text.DVXvVT29.png)_Provide the exact table/view name in a text field_

The case sensitivity of the name of a table/view depends on your database implementation.

### Single rows and batch rows

The JDBC connector can read or write to your database as a single row or in batches. When using batch triggers/actions, you must provide the batch size you wish to work with. The batch size can be any number between 1 and 100, with 100 being the maximum batch size.

![Batch trigger inputs](/assets/batch_trigger_input.3nQT2LSs.png)_Batch trigger inputs_

Besides the difference in input fields, there is also a difference between the outputs of these two types of operations. A trigger that processes rows one at a time has an output datatree that enables you to map data from that single row.

![Single row output](/assets/single_row_trigger_output.38QSb0oQ.png)_Single row output_

However, a trigger that processes rows in batches outputs them as an array of rows. The Rows datapill indicates that the output is a list containing data for each row in that batch.

![Batch trigger output](/assets/batch_trigger_output.BNjMc3gK.png)_Batch trigger output_

As a result, the output of batch triggers/actions must be handled differently. The output of the trigger can be used in actions with batch operations (like the Salesforce **Create objects in bulk** action) that requires mapping the Rows datapill into the source list. Learn how to [work with lists in Workato](/en/features/list-management#using-datapills-from-lists).

### WHERE condition

This input field filters and identifies rows to perform an action on. You can use the WHERE condition in multiple triggers and actions in the following ways:

- filter rows to be picked up in triggers
- filter rows in **Select rows** action
- filter rows to be deleted in **Delete rows** action

This clause is used as a `WHERE` statement in each request. It should follow basic SQL syntax.

#### Simple statements

Enclose string values in single quotes (`''`). Columns used must exist in the table/view.

A simple `WHERE` condition to filter rows based on values in a single column looks like this.

```sql
currency = 'USD'
```

If used in a **Select rows** action, this `WHERE` condition returns all rows that have the value 'USD' in the `currency` column. Remember to wrap datapills with single quotes in your inputs.

![Using datapills in WHERE condition](/assets/use_datapill_in_where.CcqcM98j.png)_Using datapills in `WHERE` condition_

Enclose column names with spaces in double quotes (`""`) or square brackets (`[]`). For example, to use **currency code** as an identifier, enclose it in brackets.

```sql
[currency code] = 'USD'
```

![WHERE condition with enclosed identifier](/assets/where-condition-with-enclosed-identifier.ESqH1ukn.png)_`WHERE` condition with enclosed identifier_

#### Complex statements

Your `WHERE` condition can also contain subqueries. The following example selects inactive employees from the `compensation` table.

```sql
id in (select compensation_id from users where active = 0)
```

When used in a **Select rows** action, this selects all rows in the `compensation` table related to users who are no longer active (`active = 0`).
