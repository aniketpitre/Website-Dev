> The Account credentials refresh failed trigger in the RecipeOps connector fires when OAuth 2.0 or Multi-digest connections fail to refresh access credentials.

# RecipeOps - Account credentials refresh failed trigger

The **Account credentials refresh failed** trigger monitors only OAuth 2.0 and Multi-digest connections and creates a job if these connections fail to refresh their access credentials. This trigger doesn't monitor connections that use Basic, API key, or other static API credentials, as these types of connections lack a mechanism for refreshing API credentials.

## Input

This trigger doesn't require any input.
