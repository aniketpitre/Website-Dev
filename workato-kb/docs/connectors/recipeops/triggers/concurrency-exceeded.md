> The API concurrency threshold exceeded trigger in the RecipeOps connector fires when workspace API requests exceed 80% of the concurrency quota.

# RecipeOps - API concurrency threshold exceeded

Monitors API requests across your workspace and triggers when requests exceed 80% of your concurrency quota. Additional trigger events are created for each 5% increment, up to the workspace quota. This trigger is limited to one event per threshold every five minutes to reduce noise. Subsequent requests for the same threshold within a five-minute window will not result in a job.
