> The API policy rate limit violation trigger in the RecipeOps connector fires when an access profile exceeds its assigned API rate limits.

# RecipeOps - API policy rate limit violation trigger

Actively monitors API usage across all access profiles and generates events when an access profile exceeds its assigned rate limits. It creates trigger events every five minutes for each unique access profile that goes beyond these quotas. To reduce noise, it generates only one event per access profile within this interval, even if rate limits are exceeded multiple times. For example, even if an access profile exceeds its rate limit three times within the same five-minute interval, this trigger only registers one trigger event.
