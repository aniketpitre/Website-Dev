> The On-prem agent disconnected trigger in the RecipeOps connector fires when an agent in the selected group disconnects from Workato and fails to reconnect.

# RecipeOps - On-prem agent disconnected trigger

This trigger monitors all your on-prem agents in the selected on-prem group. A trigger event is created if an agent has been disconnected from Workato due to an error (for example, a network outage or agent process has been killed) and fails to reconnect. This trigger aggregates disconnect events for a specific time frame to reduce noise.

This trigger is available starting from on-prem agent 2.19.0.
