# RecipeOps - Usage threshold reached trigger

The **Usage threshold reached** trigger monitors task usage across all Embedded customer workspaces and runs when a customer reaches a usage threshold based on their plan. The trigger generates an event each time a customer reaches a 10% increment of their plan's task usage limit.

> **EMBEDDED PARTNER WORKSPACE REQUIRED**
> 
> The **Usage threshold reached** trigger only works in Embedded partner workspaces and you must enable this trigger before you can use it. Although the trigger appears in other workspace types, jobs fail with an error if you add it to a recipe.
> 
> The RecipeOps connection used with this trigger must use an API token from the parent Embedded partner workspace. API tokens from Embedded customer workspaces result in an insufficient permissions error.
> 
> Contact your Workato Success Representative to learn more.
