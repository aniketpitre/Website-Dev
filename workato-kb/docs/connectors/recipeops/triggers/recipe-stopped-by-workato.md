> The Recipe stopped by Workato trigger in the RecipeOps connector fires when Workato stops a monitored recipe due to non-recoverable errors, in real time.

# RecipeOps - Recipe stopped by Workato trigger

The **Recipe stopped by Workato** trigger monitors selected recipes for stops due to non-recoverable errors in real-time. Workato typically stops a recipe when it encounters errors that cannot be resolved automatically. For example, Workato stops a recipe if 60 consecutive authentication errors occur in a recipe trigger. This trigger allows you to build logic to restart the recipe and set escalation policies to notify teammates when stops occur.
