# Canva Connect - Create design autofill action

The **Create design autofill** action autofills a brand template with data you provide and returns the created design once the job finishes in Canva Connect. The action waits for the autofill job to complete and times out after 30 minutes. This action requires the `brandtemplate:content:read`, `design:content:write`, and `design:meta:read` scopes, and is only available on Canva Enterprise plans.
