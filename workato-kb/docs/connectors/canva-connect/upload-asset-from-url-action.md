# Canva Connect - Upload asset from URL action

The **Upload asset from URL** action starts an asynchronous job to upload an asset from a public URL into Canva Connect and returns the job ID, instead of waiting for the upload to finish. Use the [Get record details by ID](/en/connectors/canva-connect/get-record-details-by-id-action) action with the **URL asset upload job** object to poll the job for its status and resulting asset.
