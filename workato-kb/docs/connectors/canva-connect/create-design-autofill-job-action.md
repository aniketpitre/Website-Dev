# Canva Connect - Create design autofill job action

The **Create design autofill job** action starts an asynchronous job that autofills a brand template with data and returns the job ID immediately in Canva Connect, instead of waiting for the job to finish. Use the [Get record details by ID](/en/connectors/canva-connect/get-record-details-by-id-action) action with the **Design autofill job** object to poll the job for its status and resulting design.

This action requires the `brandtemplate:content:read`, `design:content:write`, and `design:meta:read` scopes, and is only available on Canva Enterprise plans.
