# Akeneo - Upsert record action

The **Upsert record** action creates or updates a record, such as a product, in Akeneo. Akeneo uses the UUID to check whether the record exists in the system. New records are created for non-existing UUIDs and updates are made to existing records with a matching UUID. Provide the UUID of an existing record to avoid creating a duplicate record by mistake.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Object | Select the type of record to create or update. Only `Product` is available. |

| Update parent values | Enable to include parent product model attributes in the input schema and allow updates to those inherited values. |
| Locales | Enter locales to limit attribute expansion. Leave blank to expand for all enabled locales. |
