# Microsoft Dynamics Business Central - New/updated record (batch) trigger

Use the **New/updated record (batch)** trigger to monitor Microsoft Dynamics Business Central for new or updated records and return results in batches. When records are created or updated, the trigger activates with a batch of records. The trigger checks for new events every five minutes.

| Entity name | Select the entity type to monitor from the drop-down menu. Examples include Item, Customer, Vendor, Sales Order, Purchase Order, and more. |
| Batch size | The number of records to return per batch. Defaults to 30 if left blank. Maximum batch size is 100. |
| Company ID | Enter the Company ID to monitor records from. If provided, this overrides the Company ID from the connection settings. Leave blank to use the Company ID specified in the connection. |
