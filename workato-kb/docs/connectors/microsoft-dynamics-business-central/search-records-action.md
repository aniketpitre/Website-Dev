# Microsoft Dynamics Business Central - Search records action

| Entity name | Select the entity type to search from the drop-down menu. Examples include Item, Customer, Vendor, Sales Order, Purchase Order, Environment, and more. |
| Search query | A free-text search expression using OData `$search` syntax. The search query allows clients to request entities matching a free-text search expression.
