# Solace

[Solace](https://solace.com/) provides an event streaming and management platform built around the PubSub+ event broker, which lets applications, microservices, and devices publish and subscribe to messages over queues and topics. The `Solace` connector enables you to publish messages to Solace topics and queues, receive messages individually or in a batch from a queue, acknowledge messages received in manual acknowledgement mode, and trigger recipes when new messages arrive on a queue or topic.

> **PRIVATE RELEASE**
> 
> This connector is in private release. Private release features are available in production, but only to selected customers. Contact your Customer Success Manager to enable this feature.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites to use the `Solace` connector:

- An active [on-prem agent](/en/on-prem) with a configured on-prem group.
- A Solace PubSub+ broker reachable from that on-prem agent, and its broker URL.
- Credentials for one of the connector's supported authentication types. Refer to the Solace [Configuring Client Usernames](https://docs.solace.com/Configuring-and-Managing/Configuring-Client-Usernames.htm) guide for basic authentication credentials or the Solace [Configuring OAuth Authorization](https://docs.solace.com/Security/Configuring-OAuth-Authorization.htm) guide for OAuth credentials.
- Optional. SEMP management endpoint credentials, if you want Workato to populate the queue name drop-down automatically instead of entering queue names manually.

## Connection setup

The `Solace` connector supports the following authentication types:

- [Basic](#basic-connect)
- [OAuth 2.0](#oauth2-connect)
