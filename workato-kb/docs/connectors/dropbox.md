# Dropbox

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) is a cloud content management and file sharing service built for team collaboration.

The Dropbox connector enables you to automate file management and collaboration workflows across your connected applications.

> **FEATURE AVAILABILITY**
> 
> The Dropbox connector isn't available to workspaces in the CN data center. This reflects local regulatory requirements and applies to our multi-tenant and [Virtual Private Workato (VPW)](/en/cloud-hosting-editions/hosting-editions#virtual-private-workato) offerings.

## API version

The Dropbox connector uses the [Dropbox REST API v2](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/documentation).

## Connection setup

The Dropbox connector uses OAuth 2.0 authentication.

### Minimum and default scopes

The Dropbox connector supports two scope types: **individual scopes** and **team scopes**.

#### Individual scopes

The following individual scopes are requested by default:

- `account_info.read`
- `files.metadata.write`
- `files.content.write`
- `files.content.read`
- `sharing.write`
- `file_requests.write`
- `contacts.write`

The minimum required scope is `account_info.read`, which is requested in addition to any selected permissions. You can select scopes from the drop-down menu to overwrite the default scopes.

#### Team scopes

The following team scopes are requested by default:

- `account_info.read`
- `files.metadata.write`
- `files.content.write`
- `files.content.read`

- `contacts.write`

The minimum required scopes are `team_info.read` and `team_data.member`, which are requested in addition to any selected permissions. Note that `team_data.member` is required for folder access in team accounts. You can select scopes from the drop-down menu to overwrite the default scopes.

> **INDIVIDUAL SCOPES AND TEAM SCOPES**
> 
> `account_info.read` is also requested when team scopes are selected but individual scopes are left blank.
