# NocoDB - New/updated/deleted record (real-time) trigger

The **New/updated/deleted record (real-time)** trigger registers a webhook on a NocoDB table and starts a recipe when rows are inserted, updated, or deleted.

NocoDB sends webhook events to a public Workato webhook URL. This trigger supports NocoDB Cloud and self-hosted NocoDB instances with outbound internet access.

The on-prem agent only proxies requests from Workato to NocoDB. It doesn't proxy webhook events from NocoDB to Workato.

Use the [New/updated record trigger](/en/connectors/nocodb/new-updated-record-trigger)⁠ instead if your NocoDB instance can't access the internet.
