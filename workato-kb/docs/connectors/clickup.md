# ClickUp

[ClickUp](https://clickup.com/) is a cloud-based, all-in-one productivity platform designed to manage projects, tasks, and workflows, offering features like task management, document sharing, time tracking, goal setting, and automation. It aims to be a versatile tool for individuals and teams to organize, collaborate, and streamline their work processes.

## Prerequisites

To use the ClickUp API, you must authenticate every request. To allow others to use your app, implement the OAuth2 flow so each user has their own token for accessing their ClickUp resources. ClickUp uses the [authorization code](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/) grant type.

1. Log in to [ClickUp](https://app.clickup.com/login).

5. Click **Create new app**.
   
6. Provide a name for the app.
