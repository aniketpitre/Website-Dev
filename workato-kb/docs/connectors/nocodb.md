> Connect Workato to NocoDB Cloud or self-hosted instances to search, create, update, and delete table rows, and trigger recipes when records change.

# NocoDB

[NocoDB](https://nocodb.com) is an open-source no-code platform that presents tables from databases such as Postgres and MySQL as editable grids, forms, and views. The NocoDB connector enables you to read and write table rows in NocoDB Cloud or a self-hosted instance, and trigger recipes when records change.

## Connection setup

The NocoDB connector uses API token authentication.

### NocoDB setup

Complete the following steps to set up API token authentication in NocoDB:

1. Log in to your NocoDB instance. For NocoDB Cloud, go to the [NocoDB sign-in page](https://app.nocodb.com/signin/).
   
2. Copy your NocoDB instance URL from the browser address bar.
   
   Use one of the following formats:
   
   - NocoDB Cloud: `https://app.nocodb.com`
   - Self-hosted instance with a public URL: your public URL. For example, `https://nocodb.example.com`.
   - Self-hosted instance on a private network or localhost: your in-network URL. For example, `http://localhost:8080`. This connection type requires an [on-prem agent](/en/on-prem/agents). `localhost` refers to the host where the agent runs.
3. Create a NocoDB API token:
   
   1. Go to **Account Settings > API Tokens**.
      
   2. Enter a name for your API token in the **Name** field.
      
   3. Configure access to the API token in the **Resource scope** field.
      
   4. Configure permissions for the API token in the **Scopes** field.
      
   5. Click **Create new token**.

5. Use the **Connection type** drop-down menu to select **Cloud**, or select an [on-prem group](/en/on-prem/groups) to connect to a self-hosted instance on a private network or localhost.
   
6. Enter the URL of your NocoDB instance in the **Instance URL** field.
   
7. Enter your NocoDB API token in the **API token** field.
   
8. Enter your workspace ID in the **Workspace ID** field. The workspace ID is in your NocoDB URL. For example, `wxxxx`.
   
9. Click **Connect**.
