# Google Calendar - Create event action

The **Create event** action adds a new event to a calendar you specify. Created events are assigned to the connected account's time zone by default. You can create events in calendars that belong to other Google users if you have the permissions to change events.

> **ENSURE CALENDAR ACCESS**
> 
> Ensure the calendar you plan to modify is accessible from your connected account and that you have the necessary permissions to add events.
