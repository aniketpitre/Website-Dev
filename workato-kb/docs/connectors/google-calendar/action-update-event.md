# Google Calendar - Update event action

The **Update event** action updates an existing Google Calendar event you specify. The action appends new attendees to the existing participants list. If a duplicate email address is included in the list, it overwrites the existing attendee's response and comments. To add attendees without affecting the existing list, use the [Add attendees to an event action](/en/connectors/google-calendar/action-add-guest). Updated events are assigned to the connected account's time zone.

> **ENSURE CALENDAR ACCESS**
> 
> Ensure the calendar you plan to modify is accessible from your connected account and that you have the necessary permissions to edit events.
