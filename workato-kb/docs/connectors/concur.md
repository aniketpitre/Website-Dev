## Connection setup

The SAP Concur connector supports the following OAuth 2.0 authentication types:

- [Refresh token grant](#refresh-token-grant)
- [Password grant](#password-grant)
- [Authorization code grant](#authorization-code-grant)

> **REQUIRED SCOPE**
> 
> You must add the `EXPRPT` scope when connecting to SAP Concur. SAP Concur returns a `Forbidden Request` error without this scope.

### Create an OAuth 2.0 application

All authentication methods require an OAuth 2.0 application in your SAP Concur instance. Complete the following steps to create a OAuth 2.0 application, or refer to the [OAuth 2.0 Application Management Tool](https://preview.developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/oauth2-app-mgmt-tool.html) documentation:

1. Sign in to your SAP Concur instance with administrator credentials.
   
2. Go to **Administration > Company > Authentication Admin**.
   
3. Select **OAuth 2.0 Application Management** from the menu.
   
4. Click **Create new app**.
   
5. Enter a descriptive name for your application in the **App Name** field, such as `Workato Integration`.
   
6. Enter a description for your application in the **App Description** field.
   
7. Select your environment in the **App Stage** field. Choose **Development**, **Test**, or **Production**.
   
8. Select your application type in the **Application Type** field. Choose **Web Services (WS) Client** or **Integration with Concur Solutions (ICS) Client**.
   
9. Select the grants your integration requires in the **Allowed Grants** field. Select `password` and `refresh_token` for password grant or refresh token grant authentication, or `authorization_code` for authorization code grant authentication.
   
10. Enter `https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback` in the **Redirect URIs** field for authorization code grant authentication. This field appears only when you select `authorization_code`.
    
11. Configure the allowed scopes for your integration. You must include `EXPRPT` at minimum. Refer to the [Required scopes by trigger and action](/en/connectors/concur#scopes) section to identify additional scopes required by the triggers and actions you plan to use.
    
    Alternatively, you can click **Enter Manually** and copy and paste the following scopes to enable full connector functionality:
    
    ```plaintext

    > **SAVE YOUR CREDENTIALS**
    > 
    > The client secret is only displayed once. You must regenerate the client secret or create a new application if you lose it.
    

### Refresh token grant

Use the refresh token grant authentication method for production instances. Contact your Concur account manager to receive refresh token credentials.

#### Generate a company request token

A company request token is a temporary, one-time authentication password used by administrators to connect external apps to the SAP Concur.

Complete the following steps to generate a company request token:

1. Go to the SAP Concur admin panel, and click **Administration > Company > Authentication Admin**.
   
2. Select **Company Request Token** from the menu.
   
3. Enter your **App ID** (Client ID) from the OAuth application you created in the previous section.
   
4. Click **Submit**.
   
5. Record the following information displayed in the success dialog:
   
   - **Company UUID**: Your company's unique identifier.
   - **Company Request Token**: A temporary token that expires in 24 hours.
   
   > **TOKEN EXPIRATION**
   > 
   > The company request token expires after 24 hours. You must regenerate the token if you don't complete the next steps within 24 hours.
   
6. Click **OK** to close the dialog.
   

#### Obtain a refresh token

Complete the following steps to obtain a refresh token using your company request token:

1. Open an API client of your choice, such as Postman or cURL.
   
2. Create a POST request to the SAP Concur OAuth2 token resource using the endpoint that matches your SAP Concur environment:
   
   - **Production**: `https://us.api.concursolutions.com/oauth2/v0/token`
   - **Implementation (Test)**: `https://us-impl.api.concursolutions.com/oauth2/v0/token`
3. Configure the request body with the following parameters in `x-www-form-urlencoded` format:
   
   - **client\_id**: Your Client ID from the OAuth application
   - **client\_secret**: Your Client Secret from the OAuth application
   - **username**: Your Company UUID from the Company Request Token step
   - **password**: Your Company Request Token from the Company Request Token step
   - **grant\_type**: `password`
   - **credtype**: `authtoken`
   
   Example Postman configuration:
   
   ![Postman configuration for refresh token](/assets/postman-refresh-token.8IZpNlvK.png)_Postman configuration_
   
4. Send the request.
   
5. Record the **refresh\_token** value in a secure location. This value is required to establish the SAP Concur connection in Workato.

12. Click **Connect**.
    

### Authorization code grant

Use the authorization code grant authentication method to authenticate with SAP Concur using an interactive OAuth login flow.

Authorization code grant authentication is required if you plan to use [Verified User Access (VUA)](/en/agentic/agent-studio/verified-user-access). VUA isn't compatible with other grant types, including API keys, basic auth, and other OAuth 2.0 flows.

This option requires a [custom OAuth profile](#set-up-a-custom-oauth-profile) configured with your SAP Concur client credentials.

#### Set up a custom OAuth profile

Authorization code grant authentication requires a custom OAuth profile in Workato. The profile stores your SAP Concur client credentials and is required to complete the connection. Workato returns an error if you select authorization code grant without a custom OAuth profile, or if the profile is missing a client ID or client secret.

Complete the following steps to create a custom OAuth profile:

1. Go to **Tools > Custom OAuth profiles**.
   
2. Click **\+ New custom profile**.
   
3. Search for `SAP Concur` and select it as your app.
   
4. Enter a name for the profile.
   
5. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client secret** from the [OAuth application](#create-an-oauth-2-0-application) you created.
   
6. Click **Save**.
   

#### Minimum and default scopes

Ensure [your SAP Concur OAuth app](#create-an-oauth-2-0-application) has every scope you request in the connection settings. The connection fails with a `400 Bad Request` error if a requested scope isn't enabled in your OAuth app.

The minimum required scopes are `openid`, `user.read`, and `EXPRPT`. Ensure your OAuth app has these minimum scopes configured. Workato requests the following default scopes if you leave the **Scopes** field blank:

- `openid`
- `user.read`
- `user.write`
- `EXPRPT`
- `expense.report.read`
- `expense.report.readwrite`
- `LIST`
- `spend.list.read`
- `spend.list.write`
- `spend.listitem.read`
- `spend.listitem.write`
- `spend.listitem.delete`
- `IMAGE`
- `ATTEND`
- `CONFIG`
- `INVPMT`
- `INVVEN`
- `identity.user.core.read`
- `identity.user.coresensitive.read`
- `identity.user.enterprise.read`
- `identity.user.coreenterprise.writeonly`
- `identity.user.externalID.writeonly`
