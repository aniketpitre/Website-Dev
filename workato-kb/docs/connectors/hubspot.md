> The HubSpot connector lets you automate CRM workflows: create, update, and search records, manage lists, and trigger on new records and form submissions.

# HubSpot

[HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) is a leading growth platform that offers a full suite of marketing, sales, customer service, CRM software and additional services. The platform enables businesses to optimize their content, nurture leads, and monitor contacts as they become customers, to track marketing progress. HubSpot also supports integration with an ever-growing range of customer success, productivity, and finance applications to facilitate and boost the growth of businesses.

## API version

The HubSpot connector uses the [HubSpot REST API v3](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/overview).

## Supported editions and versions

The HubSpot connector works with all HubSpot cloud instances, for example, **Starter, Professional, and Enterprise**.

However, the availability of HubSpot connector triggers and action depends on the HubSpot account privileges. Access to HubSpot APIs depends on the account tier. Learn more about [HubSpot account tiers](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/working-with-oauth#scopes).
