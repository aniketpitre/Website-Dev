> Connect Power BI to Workato to automate business intelligence workflows, building reports and dashboards with Microsoft analytics tools.

# Power BI

[Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/) is a Microsoft business analytics platform that offers interactive visualizations and business intelligence tools. It enables users to create reports and dashboards.

## API version

The Power BI connector uses the [Power BI REST API v1.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/).

## Prerequisites

- [Register an application in Azure portal](#app-registration)
- [Generate a client ID (application ID)](#client-id)
- [Generate a client secret](#client-secret)
- [Assign API permissions](#api-permission)
- [Retrieve a tenant ID (for single-tenant accounts)](#tenant-id)

After you complete these prerequisites, proceed to [connect to Power BI on Workato](#connection-setup).

## How to connect to Power BI

The Power BI connector supports OAuth 2.0 authentication. Choose one of the following authentication methods based on your workspace requirements:

- [OAuth 2.0 Authorization code](#oauth-2-0-authorization-code)
- [OAuth 2.0 Client credentials](#oauth-2-0-client-credentials)

> **MICROSOFT MFA ENFORCEMENT**
> 
> Microsoft is rolling out mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA) gradually to different applications and accounts in phases. This enforcement continues throughout 2025 and beyond. Refer to the Microsoft [Mandatory multifactor authentication for Azure and admin portals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication?tabs=dotnet) documentation for more information.
> 
> We strongly recommend enabling MFA now for all Microsoft accounts used with Workato to avoid service disruptions from short-notice enforcement changes.
> 
> Complete the following steps to maintain uninterrupted service:
> 
> 1. Enable MFA for your Microsoft organization following the Microsoft MFA setup guide. Refer to [Set up multifactor authentication for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide) for more information.
>    
> 2. Reconnect your Microsoft connection in Workato.
>    
> 3. Complete the OAuth flow with MFA when prompted.
>    
> 4. Test your recipes to ensure they work with the updated connection.

1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for and select `Power BI` as your connection on the **New connection** page.
   
3. Enter a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
