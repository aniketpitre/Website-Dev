# Box - Search files or folders action (batch)

The **Search files or folders** batch action searches for files or folders in Box by name, description, or contents.

Box may not return newly created files or folders immediately due to indexing delays. If your search does not return expected results, run the search again after some time. Refer to the Box [Search indexing](https://developer.box.com/guides/search/indexing/) guide for more information.

> **SEARCH RESULTS WITH % CHARACTER**
> 
> The **Search files or folders** action may return unrelated results when you search using the % character. This happens because Box performs a broad search across multiple fields, such as names, descriptions, and file contents, rather than performing an exact string match.
> 
> Set the **Type** field to match the item you plan to search for (**File** or **Folder**) and turn on **Exact match** in the action settings. This ensures that the search returns only items whose names match the text exactly, such as a folder named `Baz%Qux`.
