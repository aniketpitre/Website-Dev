# Box - Create collaboration action

The **Create collaboration** action creates a collaboration on a file or folder in Box. You can invite users or groups, assign roles, and control whether collaborators can view folder paths. A business or enterprise Box account is required to collaborate with groups. Inviting a group to collaborate doesn't generate an email notification.

| Item | Specify the item to collaborate on. |
| File or folder ID | Enter the ID of the file or folder. You can find this at the end of the Box URL. |
| Group ID | Enter the group ID from the Box Admin console. Required if collaborating with a group. |
| Email ID of collaborator | Enter the email ID of the collaborator. The collaborator doesn't need an existing Box account. |
| Notify | Select whether to send a notification email to the user. |
| Role | Enter the role for the collaborator. |
