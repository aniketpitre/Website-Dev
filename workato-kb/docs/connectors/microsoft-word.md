> Set up and connect the Microsoft Word connector in Workato using OAuth 2.0 authorization code or client credentials authentication.

# Microsoft Word

[Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word) is a word processing application from Microsoft that's part of the Microsoft 365 suite. Workato's Microsoft Word connector enables you to integrate and automate workflows between Word documents and third-party applications.

## API version

The Microsoft Word connector uses the [Microsoft Graph API v1.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview?context=graph%2Fapi%2F1.0&view=graph-rest-1.0).

## Connection setup

The Microsoft Word connector supports the following authentication types:

- [Authorization code grant authentication (OAuth 2.0)](#authentication-auth-code)
- [Client credentials-based authentication (OAuth 2.0)](#authentication-client-credentials)

> **MICROSOFT MFA ENFORCEMENT**
> 
> Microsoft is rolling out mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA) gradually to different applications and accounts in phases. This enforcement continues throughout 2025 and beyond. Refer to the Microsoft [Mandatory multifactor authentication for Azure and admin portals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication?tabs=dotnet) documentation for more information.
> 
> We strongly recommend enabling MFA now for all Microsoft accounts used with Workato to avoid service disruptions from short-notice enforcement changes.
> 
> Complete the following steps to maintain uninterrupted service:
> 
> 1. Enable MFA for your Microsoft organization following the Microsoft MFA setup guide. Refer to [Set up multifactor authentication for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide) for more information.
>    
> 2. Reconnect your Microsoft connection in Workato.
>    
> 3. Complete the OAuth flow with MFA when prompted.
>    
> 4. Test your recipes to ensure they work with the updated connection.

### Authorization code grant authentication (OAuth 2.0)

Authorization code grant authentication requires the following value for tenant-specific account types:

- Tenant ID

#### Minimum and default scopes

The Microsoft Word connector requests the following scopes for authorization code grant connections by default. These scopes are necessary to use all of the connector's triggers and actions. Additionally, you must assign these permissions to the Workato app as **Delegated** permissions in the Azure portal.

- `Files.Read`
- `Files.ReadWrite`
- `Files.Read.All`
- `Files.ReadWrite.All`
- `User.Read`
- `offline_access`

The following minimum scopes are required to establish a connection to Microsoft Word using authorization code grant authentication:

- `User.Read`
- `offline_access`

#### Microsoft Word setup for authorization code grant authentication

Complete the following steps to set up Microsoft Word for authorization code grant authentication:

- [Register the Workato app in the Azure portal](#auth-register)
