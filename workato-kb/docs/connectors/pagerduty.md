> The PagerDuty connector lets you search, get, update, and annotate incidents, send events, and trigger recipes on new incidents and notifications.

# PagerDuty

[PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/) is an incident response platform and on-call management service.

## API version

This connector uses the [PagerDuty REST API](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/reference/REST/openapiv3.json).

## Prerequisites

You must have the following to establish a connection to PagerDuty:

- API key
- Write and read permissions

### Create an API key

You must create an API key (PagerDuty integration key) to connect to Workato. PagerDuty supports the following types of API keys:

- **General access API key**: This API key has access to all objects in your PagerDuty instance.
- **Personal API key**: This API key is restricted according to the user's permissions. This requires PagerDuty [advanced permissions](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/advanced-permissions).

Complete the following steps to create a PagerDuty API key:

1. Go to **Integrations > Developer Tools > API Access Keys** and click **Create New API Key**.
   
   Alternatively, go to **Profile > User settings** to create a Personal API key.
   
2. Enter a description that helps identify the key, such as **Workato integration key**. Ensure that you don't select `Read-only API Key`. This connection requires read and write permissions to function properly.

3. Store the API key in a secure location. Use this API key to authenticate with Workato.
   

### Permissions

You must have an Admin, Global Admin, or Account Owner role in PagerDuty to create an API key. Contact an Admin or Account Owner in your organization to create this key if you don't have one of these roles.
