> The Airtop connector lets you launch and manage cloud browser sessions and use AI actions to scrape, query, and interact with web pages in Workato.

# Airtop

[Airtop](https://airtop.ai) provides cloud browser sessions for AI agents and automation. This connector enables you to start and manage browser sessions and windows, then use AI-driven actions to load pages, scrape content, query pages with natural language, and interact with elements, all without running your own browser infrastructure.
