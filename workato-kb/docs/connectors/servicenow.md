## How to connect to ServiceNow on Workato

The ServiceNow connector supports three authentication types:

- [Username/Password (Basic authentication)](/en/connectors/servicenow#username-password)
- [OAuth 2.0 (Authorization code grant)](/en/connectors/servicenow#oauth-2-0)
- [Password grant](/en/connectors/servicenow#password-grant)

### Username/Password

Select **Username/Password** authentication type to connect to your ServiceNow instance with your login credentials.

![Username/Password connection](/assets/basic_connection.BrtIBb_F.png)_Username/Password connection_

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Connection name | Enter a unique name that identifies which ServiceNow instance it is connected to. |
| Authentication type | Choose an authentication type for this ServiceNow connection. The ServiceNow connector supports Username/Password (Basic) authentication, OAuth 2.0 using the authorization code grant, and Password grant authentication. |
| Instance name | Provide the name of your instance. For example, if your ServiceNow URL is `https://acme.service-now.com`, the instance name is `acme`. |
| Username | Provide the username you plan to use to connect to ServiceNow. |
| Password | Provide the password you plan to use to connect to ServiceNow. |
| Custom OAuth profile | Optional. Select a custom OAuth profile for this connection. |

### OAuth 2.0

Complete the following steps to set up an OAuth 2.0 connection to ServiceNow:

#### Set up an OAuth 2.0 client

Complete the following steps with a ServiceNow **admin** role to configure an OAuth 2.0 client:

1. Activate the **OAuth 2.0 (com.snc.platform.security.oauth)** plugin. Refer to the ServiceNow documentation for more information on how to [activate OAuth 2.0](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-platform-security/page/administer/security/task/t_ActivateOAuth.html).
   
   ![Activate OAuth plugin](/assets/oauth_plugin.D0N1wSeA.png)_Activate OAuth plugin_
   
2. Create an endpoint for a client application to gain access to your ServiceNow instance. Use `https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback` as the **Redirect URL**. Refer to the ServiceNow documentation for more information on how to [create an endpoint for external clients](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-platform-security/page/administer/security/task/t_CreateEndpointforExternalClients.html).
   
   ![OAuth 2.0 client](/assets/oauth_client.BNp-l2zz.png)_OAuth 2.0 client_
   
3. Use the Client ID and Client secret to create a ServiceNow connection in Workato. This triggers an OAuth authorization code grant flow that opens a new browser window requesting authorization.
   

#### Complete setup in Workato

Select the **OAuth 2.0** authentication type to connect to your ServiceNow instance without using your login credentials. This authentication type allows you to grant access to Workato by obtaining a token rather than disclosing your login credentials.

ServiceNow Istanbul and later releases support OAuth 2.0 connections that use the authorization code grant. Ensure that your ServiceNow version supports this when selecting this authentication type.

![OAuth 2.0 connection](/assets/oauth_connection.DCQBdqZY.png)_OAuth 2.0 connection_

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Connection name | Enter a unique name that identifies which ServiceNow instance it is connected to. |
| Authentication type | Choose an authentication type for this ServiceNow connection. The ServiceNow connector supports Username/Password (Basic) authentication, OAuth 2.0 using the authorization code grant, and Password grant authentication. |
| Instance name | Provide the name of your instance. For example, if your ServiceNow URL is `https://acme.service-now.com`, the instance name is `acme`. |
| Client ID | Provide the Client ID for your connection to use for authorization. Refer to the [Set up an OAuth 2.0 client](#setting-up-oauth-2-0-client) section for more information on how to set up Application Registry for an OAuth client. |
| Client secret | Provide the Client secret for this OAuth application. Click **Toggle Password Visibility** (lock icon) to reveal the secret. |
| Custom OAuth profile | Optional. Select a custom OAuth profile for this connection. |

> **INVALID REFRESH TOKEN ERROR**
> 
> You may receive an `invalid_request` or `invalid refresh token` error after your ServiceNow OAuth 2.0 connection expires. This behavior occurs because ServiceNow limits how long a refresh token remains valid. You must reauthenticate the connection when the token expires.
> 
> You can adjust the **Refresh Token Lifetime** in your ServiceNow OAuth client configuration. Go to your ServiceNow instance, click **System OAuth > Application Registry**, open your Workato OAuth client, and review the **Refresh Token Lifetime** value. The default refresh token lifetime is **100 days**.
> 
> Refer to the [ServiceNow external client](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/zurich-platform-security/page/administer/security/task/t_CreateEndpointforExternalClients.html) documentation for more information.

### Password grant

Select the **Password grant** authentication type to connect to your ServiceNow instance. This authentication type allows you to grant Workato access by providing your login credentials, which are used to obtain an access token.

![Username/Password connection](/assets/password-grant-connection.C9jkM_JE.png)_Password grant connection_

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Connection name | Enter a unique name that identifies which ServiceNow instance it is connected to. |
| Authentication type | Choose an authentication type for this ServiceNow connection. The ServiceNow connector supports Username/Password (Basic) authentication, OAuth 2.0 using the authorization code grant, and Password grant authentication. |
| Instance name | Provide the name of your instance. For example, if your ServiceNow URL is `https://acme.service-now.com`, the instance name is `acme`. |
| Username | Provide the username you plan to use to connect to ServiceNow. |
| Password | Provide the password you plan to use to connect to ServiceNow. |
| Client ID | Provide the Client ID for the connection to use for authorization. Refer to the [Set up an OAuth 2.0 client](#setting-up-oauth-2-0-client) section for more information on how to set up Application Registry for an OAuth client. |
| Client secret | Provide the Client secret for this OAuth application. Click **Toggle Password Visibility** (lock icon) to reveal the secret. |
| Custom OAuth profile | Optional. Select a custom OAuth profile for this connection. |

## Roles and permissions required to connect

To use the ServiceNow connector, you must establish the connection with a user that has roles with access control to the following tables:

| Table | Purpose | Operation | Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Tables](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-platform-administration/page/administer/table-administration/reference/r_TablesModule.html) (sys\_db\_object) | Contains a row for each table in your ServiceNow instance. This table is used to generate a list of tables to perform an action or trigger event. | read | sys\_db\_object sys\_db\_object.\* |
| [Dictionary entry](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-platform-administration/page/administer/data-dictionary-tables/concept/c_SystemDictionary.html) (sys\_dictionary) | Contains details for each table and columns in each table in your ServiceNow instance. This table is used to generate input and/or output fields when you select a table to perform and action. | read | sys\_dictionary sys\_dictionary.\* |

Some [Base system roles](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-platform-administration/page/administer/roles/reference/r_BaseSystemRoles.html) (such as **admin**) include access control to these tables. However, if you plan to grant only the minimum required access control for using the ServiceNow connector, consider [creating a custom role](#create-a-custom-role) tailored to these access controls.

In addition to their base system role, the user must have access control to the tables required in the integration use case. For example, to create an integration user that can perform standard ITIL helpdesk actions (open, update, close incidents, problems, changes, configuration management items), you must assign them the **itil** role. To grant access only to specific tables or tables besides those available in the base system roles, we recommend that you [create a custom role](#create-a-custom-role) and assign the appropriate access control as needed.

### Create a custom role

You can create a custom role with sufficient access control for the tables you plan to work with if you don't plan to use a [Base system role](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-platform-administration/page/administer/roles/reference/r_BaseSystemRoles.html) to connect to Workato.

Complete the following steps to create a custom role:

1. Create a role in your ServiceNow instance and assign it a name that reflects its association with the Workato connector, such as `Workato Integrator`. Refer to the ServiceNow documentation for more information on [creating roles](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-platform-administration/page/administer/roles/task/t_CreateARole.html).
   
2. Give your new role the following access control rules to use the ServiceNow connector:
   
   | Table | Type | Operation | Name |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | Tables | record | read | sys\_db\_object sys\_db\_object.\* |
   | Dictionary entry | record | read | sys\_dictionary sys\_dictionary.\* |
   
   > **SECURITY ADMIN ROLE REQUIRED FOR ACCESS CONTROL**
   > 
   > Only a user with `security_admin` role can edit or create access control. Confirm your permissions with your ServiceNow administrator. Read more about [Elevated privilege roles](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-platform-security/page/administer/security/concept/c_ElevatedPrivilege.html).
   > 
   > ![Elevate to privilege role](/assets/elevate_privilege_acl.CyAlYLl1.gif)_Elevate to privilege role_
   
3. Assign the relevant access control to use the triggers/actions you plan to use in your integration use case. For example, you must have a custom role that includes access control to read and write to the incident table for a workflow that requires triggering closed incident events.
   
   | Table | Type | Operation | Name |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | Incident | record | read | incident |
   | Incident | record | write | incident |
   
   ![Granting access control rule for  table to custom role](/assets/incident_table_access_control.D-FNPf-H.png)_Granting access control rule for `incident` table to custom role_
   

### Real-time triggers

The ServiceNow connector features a set of real-time triggers for new and updated records in a selected table. This trigger uses the `sys_script` table to send HTTP requests to Workato's webhook gateway when the specified event (new or new and updated records) occurs in your ServiceNow instance.

A record is automatically created in the `sys_script` table that points to a webhook URL unique to your recipe when you start a recipe with one of these triggers. Similarly, the same record in the `sys_script` table is deleted when you stop the recipe.

The account you use to establish the ServiceNow connection must be assigned roles with the following access control rules to enable this feature:

| Table | Type | Operation | Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Business Rules | record | read | sys\_script sys\_script.\* |
| Business Rules | record | write | sys\_script sys\_script.\* |
| Business Rules | record | create | sys\_script |
| Business Rules | record | delete | sys\_script |
