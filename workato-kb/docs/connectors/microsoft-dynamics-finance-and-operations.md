# Microsoft Dynamics Finance and Operations

[Microsoft Dynamics Finance and Operations](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365) (MDSFO) is one of Microsoft's enterprise resource planning software products. It is part of the Microsoft Dynamics app suite.

## Connector comparison

Workato offers two connectors for Microsoft Dynamics 365, each designed for a different set of applications within the Dynamics ecosystem:

- [Microsoft Dynamics 365](/en/connectors/dynamics-crm) (CRM apps)
- Microsoft Dynamics Finance and Operations (ERP apps)

Use the following table to determine which connector aligns with your organization's integration needs:

|  | Microsoft Dynamics 365 | Microsoft Dynamics Finance and Operations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recommended for | Sales, Customer Service, Field Service, Marketing | Finance, Supply Chain Management, Commerce, Human Resources |
| Connector type | Platform | Community |
| Required permission | `user.impersonation` (Minimum scope) | `AX.FullAccess` (Recommended scope) |
| Authentication method | OAuth 2.0 with Microsoft Dataverse | OAuth 2.0 with Microsoft Entra ID |
| API documentation reference | [Dataverse Web API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/overview) | [OData API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/data-entities-overview) |
| Authentication reference | [Dataverse OAuth](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/authenticate-oauth) | [OData OAuth](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/services-home-page#authentication) |

## Prerequisites

To establish a connection to MDSFO you must have an active sandbox or general instance.

> **MICROSOFT MFA ENFORCEMENT**
> 
> Microsoft is rolling out mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA) gradually to different applications and accounts in phases. This enforcement continues throughout 2025 and beyond. Refer to the Microsoft [Mandatory multifactor authentication for Azure and admin portals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication?tabs=dotnet) documentation for more information.
> 
> We strongly recommend enabling MFA now for all Microsoft accounts used with Workato to avoid service disruptions from short-notice enforcement changes.
> 
> Complete the following steps to maintain uninterrupted service:
> 
> 1. Enable MFA for your Microsoft organization following the Microsoft MFA setup guide. Refer to [Set up multifactor authentication for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide) for more information.
>    
> 2. Reconnect your Microsoft connection in Workato.
>    
> 3. Complete the OAuth flow with MFA when prompted.
>    
> 4. Test your recipes to ensure they work with the updated connection.
>    

### Set up an MDSFO sandbox instance

Complete the following step to obtain a sandbox instance of MDSFO. If you already have an instance, you can skip these steps.

1. Visit the [Microsoft free trial page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/dynamics-365/free-trial) to create a free trial instance.
   
2. Select **Finance and Operations**.
   
3. Enter your account details.
   

Microsoft redirects you to a page that states your instance is being prepared. This typically takes 15-20 minutes. Microsoft sends you an email notification when the instance is ready.

If this does not work, you can set up your Microsoft account as a standard [Dynamics Customer Engagement Trial](https://aka.ms/axtry).
