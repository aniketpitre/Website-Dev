> The Advance application action in the Greenhouse connector lets you move an active application to the next stage in the hiring pipeline.

# Greenhouse - Advance application action

This action moves the application to the next stage. Note that only applications with the [active status](/en/connectors/greenhouse/object-types#application-object) can be advanced.

> **DEPRECATION NOTICE**
> 
> This action uses the legacy Greenhouse v1 API, which Greenhouse will remove on August 30, 2026.
> 
> Migrate to the [Move application (v3)](/en/connectors/greenhouse/move-application-v3) action before this date. The v3 action supports broader transitions, including moving applications across stages and jobs.
> 
> Refer to the [Greenhouse v3 migration guide](/en/connectors/greenhouse/migration) to migrate your recipes.
