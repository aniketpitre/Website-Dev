# Greenhouse - Reject application action

This action rejects an application and changes the status to `rejected`. Note that only applications with the [active status](/en/connectors/greenhouse/object-types#application-object) can be rejected.

> **DEPRECATION NOTICE**
> 
> This action uses the legacy Greenhouse v1 API, which Greenhouse will remove on August 30, 2026.
> 
> Migrate to the [Reject application (v3)](/en/connectors/greenhouse/reject-application-v3) action before this date.
> 
> Refer to the [Greenhouse v3 migration guide](/en/connectors/greenhouse/migration) to migrate your recipes.
