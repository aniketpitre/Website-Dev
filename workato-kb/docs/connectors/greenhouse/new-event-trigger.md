> The New event trigger in the Greenhouse connector fires in real time when a configured candidate, application, job, or offer event arrives via webhook.

# Greenhouse - New event trigger (real-time)

This trigger picks up new events that are created in your Greenhouse instance. Events are picked up via a webhook sent from Greenhouse.

Workato listens to Greenhouse webhooks and processes them in real-time.
