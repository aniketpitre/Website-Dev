# Gumroad

[Gumroad](https://gumroad.com) is an e-commerce platform that lets creators sell digital products, memberships, and subscriptions directly to their audience. The Gumroad connector enables you to manage sales, subscribers, refunds, content access, and license keys in Workato.

Use the Gumroad connector to:

- Sync new Gumroad sales into your CRM or accounting system.
- Revoke content access automatically when a dispute or refund occurs.
- Deliver and manage software licenses by verifying, enabling, or disabling license keys.
- Notify your team when a subscription is cancelled, updated, or restarted.

You can also use [custom actions](/en/developing-connectors/custom-actions) to send a custom HTTP request to any Gumroad API endpoint. Refer to the Gumroad [API](https://app.gumroad.com/api) documentation for endpoint details.
