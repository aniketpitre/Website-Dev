# GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a popular version control application used by millions of developers and companies.

The GitHub connector enables you to build powerful automation around GitHub to help manage these software development processes and manage your agile sprints.

> **FEATURE AVAILABILITY**
> 
> The GitHub connector isn't available to workspaces in the CN data center. This reflects local regulatory requirements and applies to our multi-tenant and [Virtual Private Workato (VPW)](/en/cloud-hosting-editions/hosting-editions#virtual-private-workato) offerings.

## Use cases

Integrate the GitHub connector with your collaboration and project management tools to automate development workflows. You can streamline release management, inform teams, and document critical updates across platforms. Explore our [use cases](/en/getting-started/workato-use-cases) to discover how you can enhance your GitHub processes:

- [Generate Confluence release notes](/en/getting-started/use-cases/openai-github-confluence) from merged GitHub PRs.
- [Create summarized Confluence notes and Jira comments](/en/getting-started/use-cases/github-jira-confluence) from closed GitHub PRs.
- [Post GitHub milestones](/en/getting-started/use-cases/github-workbot-for-slack) with Workbot for Slack.

## API version

This connector uses the GitHub [REST API v3](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest).

## How to connect to GitHub on Workato

Connect to GitHub on Workato using one of the following methods:

- OAuth authentication. Workato recipes act on your behalf. Refer to [OAuth authentication](#oauth-authentication) for more information.
- GitHub Apps. Workato recipes act as the app. Refer to [GitHub App authentication](#github-app-authentication) .
- A personal access token

Refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps) for more information.

We recommend that you create GitHub Apps for access control. GitHub Apps don't assume any user's identity, which provides clear insight into your recipes' activity.

> **GITHUB APPS CONNECTION**
> 
> Each GitHub App connection links to a specific installation in an organization or user account.

## OAuth authentication

Complete the following steps to connect your GitHub to Workato using OAuth authentication:

1. Sign in to your Workato account and go to the project where you plan to add your GitHub connection.
   
2. Click **Create > Connection** (or press C twice), then select **GitHub** as your connection.
   
3. Provide a **Connection name** that identifies which GitHub instance Workato is connected to.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Use the **Authentication type** drop-down menu and select **OAuth App**.
   
6. Optional. Click **Advanced configuration** to display the **Host name** field.
   
7. Optional. Enter a **Host name**. This is applicable when using Github Enterprise Server. Enter your Github subdomain. For example, if your host URL is `https://github.example-organisation.com`, the subdomain is `github.example-organisation.com`.
   
8. Click **Connect**. Workato redirects you to GitHub. The OAuth App requests authorization to access your GitHub account.
   

## GitHub App authentication

You must first [register the app](#register-your-github-app) in your GitHub account and retrieve its credentials to connect to GitHub using a GitHub App. Use this information to [configure the connection](#setup) in Workato.

### Register your GitHub App

Complete the following steps to register your GitHub App and retrieve the credentials required to connect it to Workato:

1. Complete the [steps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app) in the GitHub documentation to register your GitHub App.
   
2. Retrieve your **GitHub App ID** in the **General** settings page of your GitHub app.
   
   ![app id](/assets/github-app-app-id.hjpO7iTw.png)_Save this App ID and place it into your connection_
   
3. Generate a **Private key** on the same page. GitHub automatically downloads this `.pem` file to your machine.
   
   ![Generate private key](/assets/github-app-private-key.Dqjm0LL8.png)_Generate the private key_
   
4. Open the `.pem` file in a text editor. The file should look similar to the following:
   
   ```
   -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

   wmEqEMXqAsPOQ0hkY+r+pE8RKQVsJCe+PIanBKp7RKWDi9usPFZQdQ==
   -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
   ```
   
5. Copy the entire private key, including the `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`. Use this private key when you set up the connection in Workato.
