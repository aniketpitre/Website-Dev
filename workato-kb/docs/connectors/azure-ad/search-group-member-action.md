# Microsoft Entra ID - Search group members action

The **Search group members** action retrieves a list of the group's direct members using search filters. A group can include users, organizational contacts, devices, service principals, and other groups.

Service principals are not listed as group members because Microsoft is gradually enabling them on the Graph V1.0 endpoint. If the number of records exceeds the limit, this action paginates through the remaining records.

## Input
