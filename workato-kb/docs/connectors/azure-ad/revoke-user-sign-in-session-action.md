# Microsoft Entra ID - Revoke sign-in session action

The **Revoke sign-in session** action invalidates a user’s refresh tokens to prevent unauthorized access to organization data. It resets the `signInSessionsValidFromDateTime` user property to the current date-time, which forces the user to sign in again to all previously authorized applications, regardless of the device.
