# Microsoft Entra ID - Search transitive group members action

The **Search transitive group members** action retrieves a list of the group's transitive members using search filters. A group can include users, devices, service principals, and other groups as members.

Refer to the [Group membership](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/groups-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0#group-membership) section for supported member types. If the number of records exceeds the limit, this action paginates through the remaining records.
