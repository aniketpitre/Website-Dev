# Gainsight NXT - Upsert persons in bulk action

The **Upsert persons in bulk** action upserts up to 50 records in the Person object in `Gainsight NXT`. Multiple person records are upserted asynchronously and may take up to 30 minutes to complete. You can apply an import lookup configuration to populate GSIDs into a field by referencing it from another object.

> **TRACK THE UPSERT STATUS**
