> This action requires OAuth 2.0 authentication. API key authentication isn't supported for actions that modify data. Your OAuth connection must include a scope that grants write access, such as **Manage YouTube account**, **Force SSL (secure access)**, or **YouTube Partner access**. The Google account associated with the connection must also have an existing YouTube channel.

## Input

| --- | --- |
| Title | Enter the title of the new playlist. |
| Description | Enter the description of the new playlist. |
| Privacy status | Select the playlist visibility. Allowed values are `public`, `private`, and `unlisted`. Defaults to `public` if left blank. |
