# Azure OpenAI - Complete text prompt action

The **Complete text prompt** action generates completions for a given prompt using OpenAI's language models. You provide a prompt and parameters, and the action returns one or multiple predicted completions. Use this action to autocomplete text, answer questions, and generate new content.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Deployment ID | Enter the deployment ID of the model you plan to use. You can find the deployment ID in **Azure AI Studio > Deployment**. |
| Prompt | Enter the prompt to generate completions for. If a prompt is not specified, the model generates content as if from the beginning of a new document. If you plan to create responses for multiple strings, or tokens, enter the relevant information as a datapill. Refer to [OpenAI's documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-prompt) for more information. |
| Maximum Tokens | Enter the maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion. The token count of your prompt plus this value cannot exceed the model's context length. Most models have a context length of 2048 tokens. Newer models, such as GPT 3.5-turbo supports 4096. |
| Suffix | Select the suffix that comes after the completion of inserted text. |
| Top p | Enter a value between 0 and 1 for controlling the diversity of completions. A higher value results in more varied responses. We recommend using `top p` or `temperature` but not both. Refer to the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/edits/create#edits/create-top_p) for more information. |
| Temperature | Enter a value between 0 and 2 to control the randomness of completions. Higher values make the output more random, while lower values make it more focused and deterministic. We recommend using `temperature` or `top p` but not both. Refer to the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/edits/create#edits/create-temperature) for more information. |
| Number of completions | Enter the number of completions to generate for each prompt. |
| Log probabilities | Enter a number to obtain the log probabilities on the next n (determined by this value) set of likely tokens and the chosen token. Refer to the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-logprobs) for more information. |
| Stop phrase | Enter a stop phrase that ends generation. For example, if you set the stop phrase to a period `.` the model generates text until it reaches a period, and then stops. Use this to control the amount of text generated. |
| Presence penalty | Enter a number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. |
| Frequency penalty | Enter a number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood of repeating the same line verbatim. |
| Best of | Enter a value that controls how many results are generated before being sent. The number of completions cannot be less than the value input here. |
| Logit bias | Enter JSON containing the tokens and the change in logit for each of those specific tokens. For example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the model from generating the `<|endoftext|>` token. Refer to the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-logit_bias) for more information. |
| User | Enter a unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. |

## Output

| Output field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Created | The datetime stamp of when the response generated. |
| ID | The unique identifier denoting the specific request and response that was sent. |
| Model | The model used to generate the text completion. |
| Text | The response of the model for the specified input. |
| Finish reason | The reason the model stopped generating more text. This is often due to stop words or length. |
| Logprobs | An object containing the tokens and their corresponding probabilities. For example, if log probabilities are set to five, you receive a list of the five most likely tokens. The response contains the logprob of the sampled token. There may be up to logprobs+1 elements in the response. |
| Response | Contains the response which OpenAI probabilistically considers to be the ideal selection. |
| Prompt tokens | The number of tokens used by the prompt. |
| Completions tokens | The number of tokens used for the completions of text. |
| Total tokens | The total number of tokens used by the prompt and response. |
