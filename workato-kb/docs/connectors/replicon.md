## How to generate user tokens on Replicon

### Using Replicon Security API reference page

1. Navigate to Replicon's Security API reference in [Replicon API Documentation](https://www.replicon.com/help/api-authentication/#authorizing-using-token-based-authentication). If prompted, log into your account.
2. On the Security API reference page, look for the `AuthenticationService1.svc/CreateAccessToken2` and click **Try it now**.
3. Replace the JSON payload with the following code, and edit the fields as needed. You can remove the `lifetime` field, which creates a permanent token.
   
   ```json
   {
     "identity": {
       "loginName": "user_name"
     },
     "lifetime": {
       "days": 0,
       "hours": 0,
       "minutes": 0,
       "seconds": 30,
       "milliseconds": 0
     },
     "description": "test",
     "unitOfWorkId": "12345"
   }
   ```
   
4. Click **Execute**.
5. Ensure that the Response Code is `200`, and that a token generates inside the JSON response body.
6. Copy the generated token and place it inside the Workato connection setup.
