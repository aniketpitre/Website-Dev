> Connect Exa to Workato to search the web, retrieve page contents, get cited answers, and trigger recipes from scheduled search monitors.

# Exa

[Exa](https://exa.ai) provides an AI-powered search API that retrieves web content using neural and keyword search, page content extraction, and answers with citations.

Use the Exa connector to:

- Search the web and return page text, highlights, or summaries.
- Retrieve text, highlights, or summaries for URLs or document IDs.
- Get an answer with cited sources.
- Create, list runs for, and delete monitors that run a search on a schedule.
- Trigger a recipe when a monitor run completes.

You can also use [custom actions](/en/developing-connectors/custom-actions) to build a custom HTTP request to any Exa API endpoint. Refer to the Exa [API Reference](https://exa.ai/docs/reference/search) documentation for endpoint details.
