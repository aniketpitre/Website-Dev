# Connect Oracle to Workato

This guide shows you how to connect an Oracle database to Workato. Complete the following steps:

- [Step 1: Set up an Oracle database user](#step-1-set-up-an-oracle-database-user).
- [Step 2: Connect Oracle to Workato](#step-2-connect-oracle-to-workato).

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following before you begin:

- An Oracle database user with the required privileges.
- The database host and port.
- A service name, SID, or TNS definition provided by your DBA.
- An active On-prem agent if your database runs in a private network.

## Step 1: Set up an Oracle database user

At a minimum, the database user account must have the `SELECT` permission for the database specified in the [connection settings](#step-2-connect-oracle-to-workato). Refer to the following example to set up permissions.

> **Click here to find out how to set up permissions**
> 
> If we are trying to connect to a named schema (`HR_PROD`) in an Oracle instance, using a new database user `WORKATO`, the following example queries can be used.
> 
> First, create a new user dedicated to integration use cases with Workato.
> 
> ```
> CREATE USER WORKATO IDENTIFIED BY password
> ```
> 
> Next, grant `CONNECT` to this user.
> 
> ```
> GRANT CONNECT TO WORKATO;
> ```
> 
> This allows the user to have login access to the Oracle instance. However, this user does not have access to any tables.
> 
> The next step is to grant access to `SUPPLIER` table in the `HR_PROD` schema. In this example, we only wish to grant `SELECT` and `INSERT` permissions.
> 
> ```
> GRANT SELECT,INSERT ON HR_PROD.SUPPLIER TO WORKATO;
> ```
> 
> Finally, check that this user has the necessary permissions. Run a query to see all grants.
> 
> ```
> SELECT * FROM DBA_ROLE_PRIVS WHERE GRANTEE = 'WORKATO';
> SELECT * FROM DBA_TAB_PRIVS WHERE GRANTEE = 'WORKATO';
> ```
> 
> This should return the following minimum permission to create a Oracle connection on Workato.
> 
> ```
> +---------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
> | GRANTEE | GRANTED_ROLE | ADMIN_OPTION | DEFAULT_ROLE |
> +---------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
> | WORKATO | CONNECT      | NO           | YES          |
> +---------+--------------+--------------+--------------+>
> 
> +---------+---------+------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
> | GRANTEE | OWNER   | TABLE_NAME | GRANTOR | PRIVILEGE | GRANTABLE | HIERARCHY |
> +---------+---------+------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
> | WORKATO | HR_PROD | SUPPLIER   | ROOT    | SELECT    | NO        | NO        |
> | WORKATO | HR_PROD | SUPPLIER   | ROOT    | INSERT    | NO        | NO        |
> +---------+---------+------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
> 3 rows in set (0.61 sec)
> ```

## Step 2: Connect Oracle to Workato

Workato supports the following Oracle connection types:

- [Cloud connection](#oracle-cloud-connection): Use this option when your Oracle database is accessible over the public internet.
- [On-prem agent connection](#oracle-opa-connection): Use this option when your Oracle database runs in a private network and requires an On-prem agent (OPA) to establish connectivity.

### Cloud connection

Complete the following steps to connect to Oracle using a Cloud connection:

1. Click **Create > Connection**.
   
2. Search for and select **Oracle** on the **New connection** page.
   
3. Enter a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Select **Cloud** in the **Connection type** field.
   
6. Enter the database host address in the **Database host** field.
   
7. Enter the number of the **Database port** the server is running on, typically `1521`.
   
8. Enter the database user's **User name** from [Step 1](#step-1-set-up-an-oracle-database-user).
   
9. Enter the database user's **Password**.
   
10. Optional. Enter the database schema in the **Schema** field.
    
11. Optional. Expand [Advanced settings](#configure-advanced-settings) to configure additional connection options.
    
12. Click **Connect**.
    

### On-prem agent connection

Use an on-prem agent connection when your Oracle database is located in a private network that can't be accessed directly from the internet.

Complete the following steps to connect to Oracle using an on-prem agent (OPA):

1. Click **Create > Connection**.
   
2. Search for and select **Oracle** on the **New connection** page.
   
3. Enter a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Select your **on-prem group** in the **Connection type** field.
   
6. Select a **Database type**. Available options include **Service name**, **SID**, and **TNS**.
   
   SID and TNS database types require On-prem agent version 27.1 or later.
   
   Refer to the [Database types](#database-type-reference) section for more information.
   
7. Provide the following fields based on the **Database type** selected:
   
   **Service name**
   
   Enter the Oracle service name for the database in the **Service name** field.
   
   **SID**
   
   Enter the Oracle system identifier (SID) for the database instance in the **SID** field.
   
   **TNS**
   
   Enter the full Oracle Net connection descriptor from your `tnsnames.ora` configuration in the **TNS Definition** field.
   
8. Complete the following fields if you selected **Service name** or **SID** as the **Database type**:
   
   1. Enter the database host address in the **Database host** field.
      
   2. Enter the number of the **Database port** the server is running on, typically `1521`.
      
9. Enter the database user's **User name** from [Step 1](#step-1-set-up-an-oracle-database-user).
   
10. Enter the database user's **Password**.
    
11. Optional. Enter the database schema in the **Schema** field.
    
12. Optional. Expand [Advanced settings](#configure-advanced-settings) to configure additional connection options.
    
13. Optional. Expand **Pooling settings** to configure Oracle database connection pooling.
    
14. Optional. Expand **Additional properties for Oracle connection** to add custom Oracle connection parameters.
    
15. Click **Connect**.
    

## Database types

Workato displays the **Database type** field only when you select an **On-prem group** in the **Connection type** field while creating an Oracle connection.

Refer to [Step 2: Connect Oracle to Workato](#step-2-connect-oracle-to-workato) for instructions on configuring the connection.

Select one of the following **Database type** options when connecting through an On-prem agent (OPA).

### Service name

Use **Service name** to connect to a database service within an Oracle instance. For example, `ORCLPDB1`.

> **ORACLE 12C+ PDB ENVIRONMENTS**
> 
> We recommend using **Service name** instead of **SID** in Oracle 12c and later environments that use multitenant architecture (CDB/PDB).
> 
> In these environments:
> 
> - **SID** connections may connect to the **CDB root container**
> - **Service name** connections may connect to a specific **pluggable database (PDB)**
> 
> If a database user exists in a PDB, authentication can fail when connecting through the CDB root even if the username and password are correct.
> 
> Use **Service name** to ensure the connection targets the correct PDB.

Service names have the following characteristics:

- Map to database services registered with the Oracle listener
- Support Real Application Clusters and load balancing
- Identify logical database services rather than specific instances

Use this option for most modern Oracle deployments.

### SID

Use **SID** (System Identifier) to connect to a specific Oracle database instance. For example, `ORCL`.

SIDs have the following characteristics:

- Identify a single Oracle database instance
- Do not support load balancing
- Commonly appear in older Oracle deployments

Use this option when your DBA provides an SID instead of a service name.

### TNS

Use **TNS** when you have a full Oracle Net connect descriptor.

TNS definitions have the following characteristics:

- Reference connection entries defined in the `tnsnames.ora` file
- Abstract the underlying connection details
- May internally use a **SID** or **Service name**
- Support advanced configurations such as load balancing and high availability

Enter the full TNS descriptor in the **TNS definition** field. For example:

```text
(DESCRIPTION=
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=db.example.com)(PORT=1521))
(CONNECT_DATA=
(SERVICE_NAME=ORCLPDB1)
)
)
```

## Configure advanced settings

Oracle connectors have the following advanced settings:

> **TIP**
> 
> While this step is optional, we strongly recommend defining the **Use improved datetime handling** settings. These settings allow you to set your local database timezone and improve datetime timezone conversion during insertion.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Use improved datetime handling** | Overrides the default database timezone of `UTC`. If enabled, `date` and `timestamp` data types are converted during insertion to the **Database timezone** you provide. **Note**: This setting only affects [Insert actions](/connectors/oracle/insert.html). |
| **Database timezone** | Defines the local timezone of your database and requires \*\*Use improved datetime handling\*\* to be enabled. If not defined, Workato uses `UTC` as the timezone. Additionally, if \*\*Use improved datetime handling\*\* is not enabled, this setting is not respected. **Note**: This setting only affects [Insert actions](/connectors/oracle/insert.html). |

Let's look at some examples of how these settings affect how `datetime` data is handled in [Insert actions](/en/connectors/oracle/insert).

**All examples assume the Database timezone is set to UTC -04:00 (Eastern Standard Time).**

| Source value | Destination column | Destination value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `2020-12-02 10:00:00` Source value doesn't have a timezone component | NOT timezone capable (DATE or TIMESTAMP) | `2020-12-02 10:00:00` Value is inserted as-is, as conversion is unnecessary |
| `2020-12-02 10:00:00` Source value doesn't have a timezone component | Timezone capable (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE) | `2020-12-02 10:00:00 -04:00` Value has **Database timezone** applied |
| `2020-12-02 10:00:00 -07:00` Source value has a timezone component, but it's not the same as the **Database timezone** (`UTC -04:00`) | NOT timezone capable (DATE or TIMESTAMP) | `2020-12-02 13:00:00` Value is converted using the **Database timezone** |
| `2020-12-02 10:00:00 -07:00` Source value has a timezone component, but it's not the same as the **Database timezone** (`UTC -04:00`) | Timezone capable (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE) | `2020-12-02 13:00:00 -04:00` Value is converted using the **Database timezone** |
