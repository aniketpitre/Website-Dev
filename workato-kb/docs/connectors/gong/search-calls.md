# Gong - Search calls action

The **Search calls** action lists detailed call data from Gong for calls that match a date range, specific call IDs, or both.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Starting date time | Enter the date from which to list calls. Leave blank to start with the earliest recorded call. The date applies to call start time. |
| Ending date time | Enter the date until which to list calls. The date denotes the scheduled time for web-conference calls recorded by Gong, and the actual start time for all other calls. |
