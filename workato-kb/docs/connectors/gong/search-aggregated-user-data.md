# Gong - Search aggregated user data action

This action will search aggregated user data in Gong. Lists the aggregated activity of multiple users within the Gong system for each time period within the defined date range. This endpoint returns multiple records, one for each user. For each user there are items for every time period in the date range, including statistics about the user's activity. Records are returned only for users with activity in the range.
