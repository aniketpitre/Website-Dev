  - `glue:GetDatabases`
  - `glue:GetDatabase`
  - `glue:GetTables`
  - `glue:GetTable`
  - `glue:CreateTable`
  - `glue:CreateJob`
  - `glue:DeleteJob`
  - `glue:StartJobRun`
  - `glue:GetJobRun`
  - `glue:GetCatalogs`
  - `s3:GetObject`
  - `s3:PutObject`
  - `s3:DeleteObject`

4. Select the **Location** where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Select **Access key** as the **Authentication type**. Refer to the [Identity and access management for AWS Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/security-iam.html) guide for more information about IAM-based access.
   
6. Enter the **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** from your IAM user. Go to **IAM > Users > \[your user\] > Security credentials** in the AWS console to retrieve these credentials. Refer to [Use IAM role-based authentication for AWS Services](/en/security/data-protection/secrets-management/iam-role-based-authentication-for-aws#use-iam-role-based-authentication-for-aws-services) for more information.
   
7. Enter the AWS **Region** where your S3 buckets and Glue jobs reside. For example, your region is `us-east-1`, if your console URL is `https://us-east-1.console.s3.amazon.com`.
   
8. Click **Connect**.
   

**IAM role**

1. Create a new connection and select the **S3 Data Lake** connector.
