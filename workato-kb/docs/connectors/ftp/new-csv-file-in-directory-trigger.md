# FTP/FTPS - New CSV file added in directory on FTP/FTPS server (batch)

The **New CSV file added in directory on FTP/FTPS server** trigger monitors a server directory for newly added CSV files. Jobs are only triggered from CSV files located at the first level of the directory that contains rows.

Use the [New/updated file in directory trigger](/en/connectors/ftp/new-updated-file-in-directory-trigger) to instead monitor new and updated files.

## Input

| Trigger poll interval | Specify how frequently to check for new events. Defaults to five minutes if left blank. The minimum value allowed is five minutes. Refer to the [Polling intervals](/en/recipes/polling-intervals) documentation for more information. |
| Directory path | Select a directory from the menu, or enter it manually. The trigger processes files in this directory by time last modified in ascending order. |
