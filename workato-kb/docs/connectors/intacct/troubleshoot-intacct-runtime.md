# Troubleshoot Intacct runtime errors

Use this guide to troubleshoot errors that occur at runtime when you use the Intacct connector in Workato.

## Custom fields don't display in the recipe

Custom fields created for a **Sales Order** or **Sales Invoice** may not appear when you create or convert sales transactions in a recipe.

Ensure that the custom field is associated with an **Order Entry Transaction Detail** object to resolve the issue.

This association allows the recipe to use the custom field as an optional field.
