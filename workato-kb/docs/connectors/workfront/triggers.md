> Triggers in the Workfront connector that fire on new events in real time or poll for new and updated objects every configured interval.

# Workfront - Triggers

The Workfront connector supports the following triggers:

- [New Event trigger](#new-event-trigger) allows you to trigger recipes in real-time.
- [New Object trigger](#new-object-trigger) polls for new objects every configured polling interval.
- [New or updated Object trigger](#new-or-updated-object-trigger) polls for new or updated objects every configured polling interval.

## New event trigger

This trigger picks up new events in Workfront in real time. Each new job represents a single event. The output of the event trigger depends on the event selected in the trigger configuration.
