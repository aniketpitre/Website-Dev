> The Google Docs connector enables you to automate document workflows, creating, editing, and collaborating on cloud-based documents in real time.

# Google Docs

[Google Docs](https://workspace.google.com/intl/en_in/products/docs/) is a cloud-based word processor that enables users to create, edit, and collaborate on documents in real-time. It integrates seamlessly with Google Workspace and offers features like commenting, version history, and smart editing tools to enhance productivity.

## API version

The Google Docs connector uses the [Google Docs API v1](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/reference/rest).

## Connection setup

The Google Docs connector supports the following authentication types:

- [OAuth 2.0](/en/connectors/google-docs#oauth2)
- [Service account](/en/connectors/google-docs#service-account)

> **SERVICE ACCOUNT AUTHENTICATION**
> 
> You can use a service account to authenticate without a personal user account. For consistent use, Workato recommends service account authentication.

### Service account authentication

A Google service account is a specialized Google account associated with a Google Cloud Project (GCP) that can run API requests on your behalf.

Service accounts provide the following benefits:

- **Continuous operation:** Service accounts ensure that operations continue even if individual user permissions change.
- **Dedicated permissions:** Service accounts can only access projects that you share with them.
- **Dedicated API quotas:** You can manage a service account's API quotas through GCP and request quota increases directly from Google.

Refer to the [Google service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) to learn more about service accounts.
