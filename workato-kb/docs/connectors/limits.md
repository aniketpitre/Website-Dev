## Read request timeout limits

View read request timeout limits

The read request timeout limit is the number of seconds the client (gateway) waits for the server to respond. A read timeout occurs when the connection is established and the request is sent, but the server doesn't send a response before the timeout limit is reached. This prevents the request from being read.

| Description | Quota | Notes |
