# JWT tools by Workato

The JWT tools by Workato connector provides a secure method for generating and decoding JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure authentication and information exchange. JWTs are compact, URL-safe methods to represent claims between two parties. These claims are encoded as a JSON object. You can use them in a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as plaintext in a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure. This allows you to create digital signatures and integrity protection with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) or encryption.

## Prerequisites

Before using the JWT tools connector, you must complete the following steps:

1. [Generate a public/private key pair](/en/oem/jwt-direct-linking#step1)
   
2. [Install a direct link URL microservice](/en/oem/jwt-direct-linking#step2)
   
3. [Generate a JWT](/en/oem/jwt-direct-linking#step3)
