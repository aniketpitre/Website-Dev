> The SharePoint connector lets you automate document workflows: upload, download, and search files and manage list rows, with triggers on new files and rows.

# SharePoint

[SharePoint](https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/collaboration) is a web-based collaboration, document management and storage system integrated with Microsoft Office. It is primarily used for document management and storage but is highly configurable and usage varies substantially among organizations.

Workato's SharePoint connector enables you to build integrations and automations around SharePoint and other third-party applications.

## API version

The SharePoint connector uses the [SharePoint REST API v1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/get-to-know-the-sharepoint-rest-service).

## How to connect to SharePoint

To connect SharePoint to Workato, you must have an Azure account. Workato supports the following authentication methods:

- [Authorization code grant connection](#authentication-auth-code-grant)
- [Client credentials grant connection](#authentication-client-cred)

> **MICROSOFT MFA ENFORCEMENT**
> 
> Microsoft is rolling out mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA) gradually to different applications and accounts in phases. This enforcement continues throughout 2025 and beyond. Refer to the Microsoft [Mandatory multifactor authentication for Azure and admin portals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication?tabs=dotnet) documentation for more information.
> 
> We strongly recommend enabling MFA now for all Microsoft accounts used with Workato to avoid service disruptions from short-notice enforcement changes.
> 
> Complete the following steps to maintain uninterrupted service:
> 
> 1. Enable MFA for your Microsoft organization following the Microsoft MFA setup guide. Refer to [Set up multifactor authentication for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide) for more information.
>    
> 2. Reconnect your Microsoft connection in Workato.
>    
> 3. Complete the OAuth flow with MFA when prompted.
>    
> 4. Test your recipes to ensure they work with the updated connection.

### Client credentials grant connection

This method requires the following values:

- **Subdomain**
- **API Scope**
- **Tenant ID**
- **Client ID**
- **Certificate**
- **Private Key**

> **USE SEPARATE CONNECTIONS FOR RECIPES AND DATA PIPELINES**
> 
> Recipe triggers and actions require a client credentials connection with the **SharePoint API** or **SharePoint & Graph API** API scope. Data pipelines require the **Graph API (Data-Pipelines only)** scope, which doesn't work with recipes. Create a separate SharePoint connection for data pipelines. Refer to [Configure Microsoft SharePoint as a data pipeline source](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-sharepoint) for more information.

#### Register the Workato app in the Azure Portal

Complete the following steps to register the Workato app and obtain the required values for client credentials grant connections.

1. Register the Workato app in the Azure Portal
   
   Complete the following steps to register the Workato app in the Azure portal:
   
   1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

   2. Copy the `Application (client) ID` and `Directory (tenant) ID` for use in Workato.
      
   
4. Generate a certificate and private key
   
   You need a certificate and private key to authenticate using client credentials. You can generate these locally using OpenSSL or PowerShell.
   
   Complete the following steps to generate a self-signed certificate with OpenSSL:
   
   1. Open terminal, or another CLI (command-line interface) tool.
      
   2. Create a password-protected, 2048-bit RSA private key named `domain.key`:

      openssl genrsa -out domain.key 2048
      ```
      
   3. Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) `domain.csr` from the private key. Provide values for the required fields when prompted:
      
      ```bash
      openssl req -key domain.key -new -out domain.csr
      ```
      
   4. Create a self-signed certificate named `domain.crt` with your private key and CSR:
      
      ```bash
      openssl x509 -signkey domain.key -in domain.csr -req -days 365 -out domain.crt
      ```
      
   5. Open `domain.crt` and copy the entire certificate string, including the `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` lines. Use this as your **Certificate** value in Workato.
      
   6. Open `domain.key` and copy the entire private key string, including the `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----` lines. Use this as your **Private key** value in Workato.
      
   7. Go to **Manage > Certificates & secrets > Certificates** in the Azure Portal.
      
   8. Click **Upload certificate** and select the `domain.crt` file.
      
   9. Provide a description for the certificate.
      
   10. Click **Add**.
       
   

Return to Workato to finish [setting up your connection](#complete-setup-in-workato).

16. Click **Sign in with Microsoft**.
    

## Permissions required to connect

You must assign the correct SharePoint REST API permissions to the Workato app in the Azure Portal before you can create a connection. The required scopes vary by authentication type.

### Minimum scopes for authorization code grant connections

The following minimum scopes are required to establish a connection to SharePoint using authorization code grant authentication:

- `Sites.Selected (Delegated)`

The `Sites.Selected` permission doesn't grant your app access to any sites by itself. A SharePoint or Global admin must grant your app access to each site you plan to use. Refer to [Grant site access for Sites.Selected](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-sharepoint#grant-site-access-for-sites-selected) for more information.

### Recommended scopes for authorization code grant connections

We recommend the following scopes for authorization code grant connections. These scopes are necessary to use all of this connector's triggers and actions. Additionally, you must assign these permissions to the Workato app as a **Delegated** permission in the Azure Portal:

- `AllSites.Write (Delegated)`

### Minimum scopes for client credentials grant connections

The following minimum scopes are required to establish a connection to SharePoint using client credentials grant authentication:

- `Sites.Selected (Application)`

The `Sites.Selected` permission doesn't grant your app access to any sites by itself. A SharePoint or Global admin must grant your app access to each site you plan to use. Refer to [Grant site access for Sites.Selected](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-sharepoint#grant-site-access-for-sites-selected) for more information.

### Recommended scopes for client credentials grant connections

We recommend the following scopes for client credentials connections. These scopes are necessary to use all of the SharePoint connector triggers and actions. Additionally, you must assign these permissions to the Workato app as an **Application** permission in the Azure Portal:

- `Sites.ReadWrite.All (Application)`

## Connect Microsoft Entra ID to the SharePoint connector

To connect to the SharePoint connector using a Microsoft Entra ID account, ensure that all the consent requests are granted by admins.

Complete the following steps to grant admin consent using an admin account:

1. Sign in to your Azure portal and navigate to **Enterprise Applications > Activity > Admin consent requests**.
   
2. Approve the necessary consent requests.
