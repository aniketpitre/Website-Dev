# Xero - Create invoice with one line item action

The **Create invoice with one line item** action allows you to create a new invoice in Xero with a single line item entry. This action is typically used with the [Upsert line item to bill or invoice action](/en/connectors/xero/upsert-line-item) to create invoices with multiple line items.
