# Trello - List cards action (batch)

The **List cards** action retrieves the cards in a list you specify.

The action scans a maximum of 5,000 cards per call when you filter by assignee, label, or due date. If the `More cards to scan` output field is `true`, this means that the scan stopped before reaching older cards. Use the Cursor output datapill to continue the scan from where it stopped.
