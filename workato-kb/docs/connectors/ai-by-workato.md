# AI by Workato

AI by Workato is a Workato utility connector built through our collaboration with leading AI model providers. It uses models and prompts from Anthropic and OpenAI. AI by Workato doesn't use user data for training purposes.

> **FEATURE AVAILABILITY**
> 
> AI by Workato is available for customers on specific pricing plans in the US, EU, AU, JP, SG, IL, KR, and UK data centers.
> 
> AI by Workato processes data using Anthropic's models in most regions. Workato enforces data residency in the US and EMEA by ensuring data is processed within the same region (US or EMEA) as the source data center. The SG, JP, and AU data centers process AI by Workato data within the APAC region. The Israel data center processes data in the US using OpenAI's models.
> 
> AI by Workato isn't available to workspaces in the CN data center. This reflects local regulatory requirements and Workato's commitment to data sovereignty and applies to our multi-tenant and [Virtual Private Workato (VPW)](/en/cloud-hosting-editions/hosting-editions#virtual-private-workato) offerings.
> 
> You can opt in to this feature by agreeing to our [AI feature addendum](https://www.workato.com/legal/ai-feature-addendum). Contact your Customer Success representative to learn more.
