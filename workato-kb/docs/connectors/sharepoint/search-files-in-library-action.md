# SharePoint - Search files in SharePoint library action (batch)

This action searches for files in a folder you specify in a SharePoint library.

## Input

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Site name | Provide the name of the SharePoint site to which you plan to connect. If left blank, Workato connects to your default home site, as specified in your connection settings. The site name is located in the URL of the site page. For example, if the URL is `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/sites/product`, the site name is `product`. If you plan to connect to a different site, you can provide the absolute URL to override the base URL. For example, if the input is `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/teams/product`, Workato connects to the provided input. Alternatively, you can provide the absolute URL to connect to a different site. For example, entering `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/teams/product` connects Workato to the specified site directly. |
