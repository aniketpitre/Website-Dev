# SharePoint - Get file or folder permissions in SharePoint library action (batch)

This action retrieves the permissions of a specific file or folder in a SharePoint library. The specified folder can also be a document library. All associated permissions (both individual and group permissions) are listed.

## Input

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Document Library/Folder/Files | Select which entity to provide the permissions for. If File or Folder is selected, select the file or folder from the drop-down in addition to selecting the document library. |
| Site name | Provide the name of the SharePoint site to which you plan to connect. If left blank, Workato connects to your default home site, as specified in your connection settings. The site name is located in the URL of the site page. For example, if the URL is `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/sites/product`, the site name is `product`. If you plan to connect to a different site, you can provide the absolute URL to override the base URL. For example, if the input is `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/teams/product`, Workato connects to the provided input. Alternatively, you can provide the absolute URL to connect to a different site. For example, entering `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/teams/product` connects Workato to the specified site directly. |
| Document library | Provide the document library containing the file or folder. |
| Folder | Select the folder for which you plan to retrieve permissions. Alternatively, you can provide the relative URL of the folder. For example, `/sites/sitename/documentlibrary/foldername`. |
