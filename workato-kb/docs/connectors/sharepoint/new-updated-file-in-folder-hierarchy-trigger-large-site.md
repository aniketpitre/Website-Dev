# SharePoint - New/updated file in folder hierarchy trigger (large site)

The **New/updated file in folder hierarchy (large site)** trigger detects new or modified files within your SharePoint folder hierarchy. It checks for changes at each polling interval and processes each file as a separate job.

Use this trigger when monitoring a folder within a large SharePoint site that has more than 5,000 files.

> **TRIGGER DOESN'T RETRIEVE PAST EVENTS**
> 
> This trigger doesn't retrieve updates made before the recipe starts. It only detects changes from the moment the recipe begins running. If your folder isn't in a large site, consider using the [New/updated file in folder hierarchy trigger](/en/connectors/sharepoint/new-updated-file-in-folder-hierarchy-trigger) instead.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Trigger poll interval | Specify how frequently to check for new events. Defaults to five minutes if left blank. The minimum value allowed is five minutes. |
| Site name | Provide the name of the SharePoint site you plan to connect to. If left blank, Workato connects to the default home site specified in your connection settings. The site name is located in the URL of the site page. For example, if the URL is `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/sites/product`, the site name is `product`. Alternatively, to connect to a different site, you can provide an absolute URL to override the base URL. For example, entering `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/teams/product` connects Workato to the specified site directly. |
