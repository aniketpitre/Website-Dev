# SharePoint - Move file in SharePoint library action

This action moves a file to a specific folder in a SharePoint library.

The site name is located in the URL of the site page. For example, if the URL is `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/sites/product`, the site name is `product`.

For example, if the input is `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/teams/product`, Workato connects to the provided input. Alternatively, you can provide the absolute URL to connect to a different site. For example, entering `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/teams/product` connects Workato to the specified site directly. |
