# SharePoint - List files and folders within a folder in SharePoint library action (batch)

This action lists all files and folders within a specified folder in SharePoint library.

## Input

| Field | Description |

The site name is located in the URL of the site page. For example, if the URL is `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/sites/product`, the site name is `product`. If you plan to connect to a different site, you can provide the absolute URL to override the base URL. For example, if the input is `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/teams/product`, Workato connects to the provided input.
