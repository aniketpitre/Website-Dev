# SharePoint - Upload attachment in SharePoint list action (file)

This action uploads an attachment to a specified item in a SharePoint list.

## Input

| Field | Description |

| Site name | Provide the name of the SharePoint site to which you plan to connect. If left blank, Workato connects to your default home site, as specified in your connection settings. The site name is located in the URL of the site page. For example, if the URL is `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/sites/product`, the site name is `product`.
