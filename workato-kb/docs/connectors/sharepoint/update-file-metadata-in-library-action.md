> The update file metadata action in the SharePoint connector lets you update the metadata fields of a file in a library you specify.

# SharePoint - Update file metadata in SharePoint library action

This action updates the metadata of a file in a SharePoint library you specify.

## Input

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Site name | Provide the name of the SharePoint site to which you plan to connect. If left blank, Workato connects to your default home site, as specified in your connection settings. The site name is located in the URL of the site page. For example, if the URL is `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/sites/product`, the site name is `product`. If you plan to connect to a different site, you can provide the absolute URL to override the base URL. For example, if the input is `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/teams/product`, Workato connects to the provided input. Alternatively, you can provide the absolute URL to connect to a different site. For example, entering `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/teams/product` connects Workato to the specified site directly. |
| Document library | Select the document library containing the file. |
| Parent folder | Specify the parent folder containing the file. |
| File name | Provide the name of the file whose metadata you plan to update. For example, `sample file.docx`. Select the **Encoded file name** option to use the URL encoded file name instead. |
| Additional fields | Provide input for the metadata fields you plan to update. These fields are dynamic and are determined by the file you select. |
