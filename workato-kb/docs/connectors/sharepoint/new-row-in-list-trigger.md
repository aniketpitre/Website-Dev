> The new row trigger in the SharePoint connector picks up new rows in a list you specify on each poll interval and processes each as a job.

# SharePoint - New row in SharePoint list trigger

This trigger picks up new rows in your SharePoint list. It checks for new rows once every poll interval and Workato processes each row as a separate job.

## Input

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Trigger poll interval | Specify how frequently to check for new events. Defaults to five minutes if left blank. The minimum value allowed is five minutes. |
| Site name | Provide the name of the SharePoint site to which you plan to connect. If left blank, Workato connects to your default home site, as specified in your connection settings. The site name is located in the URL of the site page. For example, if the URL is `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/sites/product`, the site name is `product`. If you plan to connect to a different site, you can provide the absolute URL to override the base URL. For example, if the input is `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/teams/product`, Workato connects to the provided input. Alternatively, you can provide the absolute URL to connect to a different site. For example, entering `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/teams/product` connects Workato to the specified site directly. |
