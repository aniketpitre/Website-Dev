# Facebook Lead Ads

[Facebook Lead Ads](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/lead-ads) is a targeted advertising tool that allows businesses to collect lead information directly through ads, using forms that auto-populate with a user's Facebook contact details. You can use Facebook Lead Ads to efficiently capture leads, enhance your marketing campaigns, and drive customer engagement.

> **FEATURE AVAILABILITY**
> 
> The Facebook Lead Ads connector isn't available to workspaces in the CN data center. This reflects local regulatory requirements and applies to our multi-tenant and [Virtual Private Workato (VPW)](/en/cloud-hosting-editions/hosting-editions#virtual-private-workato) offerings.

## API version

The Facebook Lead Ads connector uses the [Facebook Marketing API v24.0](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis/).

## Connection setup

Complete the following steps to create a Facebook Lead Ads connection in Workato.

1. Enter a **Connection name** to label your Facebook Lead Ads account within Workato.

## Troubleshooting

If you have connected your Facebook account, given the relevant pages access and still can't trigger the recipe despite new leads being added -- utilize [this tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing) to help with debugging the setup. You can select the relevant page and form and see if the Workato App has been successfully subscribed and even send a test webhook lead to check.

If the Workato application isn't subscribed correctly, the likely issue is that it needs be explicitly provided [CRM access](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/540596413257598?id=735435806665862) within Meta business manager.

We provide a step by step guide to the same as follows:

1. Set up a New leads trigger, start the recipe.
   
2. Sign in to [Meta Business Suite](https://business.facebook.com)
   
3. Select your business in the drop-down menu.
   
4. Go to **Settings > Integrations > Leads access**.
   
5. Go to the **CRMs** tab and click **Assign CRMs**. Once you have started the recipe, Workato's OAuth app should be listed in the select options.

6. Now the OAuth app should be listed in the [Facebook leads testing tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing), and the recipe should receive events when leads are created.
