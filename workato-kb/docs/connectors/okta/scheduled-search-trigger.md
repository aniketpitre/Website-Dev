# Okta - Scheduled event search trigger

Configure the Okta connector to execute a search of log events on a specified schedule. Events can be filtered (for example, searching for a specific target ID or actor ID).

Events will be returned in batches. The default batch size is **100** and the max batch size is **1000**.

## Output

This trigger will return metadata data about the scheduled event search as well as data about individual log events. Refer to [Event outputs](/en/connectors/okta/events-output-datatree) for more information about event outputs.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Range | The range of event IDs retrieved from the search. |
| First record ID | The ID of the first event in the batch. |
| Last record ID | The ID of the last event in the batch. |
| Events | This contains a list of events. Each event contains information about the event like the timestamp, the actor, the client used, the authentication and security contents. Refer to [Event outputs](/en/connectors/okta/events-output-datatree) for more information about event outputs. |
| Scheduled time | The time the search was executed. |
| Total number of records | The number of events retrieved in this search. |
| First batch | Whether this is the first batch of log events. |
| Last batch | Whether this is the last batch of log events. |
| Starting offset | The offset number for the first event of this batch. For example, if there are `500` events from this scheduled search and the trigger uses a batch size of `100`. On the 2nd batch (rows `101` to `200`), the starting offset will be `100`. |
| Ending offset | The offset number for the last event of this batch. For example, if there are `500` events from this scheduled search. and the trigger uses a batch size of `200`. On the 2nd batch (rows `101` to `200`), the ending offset will be `200`. |
