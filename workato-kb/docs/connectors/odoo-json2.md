> Connect Workato to Odoo's JSON-2 API to create, update, search, and sync records across any Odoo object, run object functions, and complete guided wizards.

# Odoo (JSON-2)

[Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) provides a comprehensive suite of business applications that enables businesses to manage and automate key processes across departments such as sales, CRM, inventory, and accounting. You can use this connector to interact with Odoo (JSON-2) modules, enabling efficient data management and automation.

The Odoo (JSON-2) connector uses the JSON-2 API and builds input and output schemas dynamically. The connector retrieves fields directly from your Odoo (JSON-2) environment when you select an object. Use the Odoo (JSON-2) connector to create, update, and retrieve records for any object, search records by custom criteria, run object functions and guided wizards, retrieve quotations by validity date, and trigger recipes when an object is created or updated.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites to use the Odoo (JSON-2) connector:
