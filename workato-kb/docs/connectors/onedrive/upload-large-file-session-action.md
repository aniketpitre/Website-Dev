# OneDrive - Upload large file using session action (file)

The **Upload large file using session** action uploads a large file to Microsoft OneDrive using a file session. There is no fixed file size limit. The maximum size depends on whether the upload completes within the job timeout limit.

## Input

| Input fields | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Folder | Select the folder where you plan to upload files. Enter the file path where you plan to add the new file. For example, `folder-one/folder-two`. |
| File name | Provide the file name with its extension, such as `New-csv-file.csv`. If a file with the same name exists, the action overwrites it. |
| File size | Enter the size of the file in bytes. |
| File contents in text or binary format | Provide the content of the file in text or binary format. |
| Chunk size | Configure the chunk size to optimize throughput. A larger chunk size increases throughput but risks hitting API quotas. The value entered is multiplied by `320` KB. The default is `5` (`1600` KB). |

| CTag | The CTag (change tag) is a timestamp or identifier used to track changes in a folder in OneDrive. It is often used for synchronization of folder contents, rather than individual files. |
