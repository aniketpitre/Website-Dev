# Python snippets by Workato

The Python snippets by Workato connector allows you to write and execute custom [Python](https://www.python.org/) code in your recipes.

Python is a popular programming language used for web applications, data pipelines, and machine learning.

Workato's Python snippets by Workato connector enables you to perform the following tasks:

- Transform data, such as converting date formats.
- Convert file formats, such as CSV to JSON.
- Process large datasets by breaking batches into smaller chunks, such as splitting 5,000 records into chunks of 500 to prevent API timeouts.
