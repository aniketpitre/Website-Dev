# JMS tools by Workato

**JMS tools by Workato** is an on-premise connector that allows Workato to interact with Java Message Service (JMS) providers. You can use this connector to subscribe to topic/queue and publish to topic/queue.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites to use the JMS tools by Workato connector:

- An active [on-prem agent](/en/on-prem)
- A configured [JMS connection profile](/en/on-prem/agents/connection/profile#jms-profile)
- A configured [common data model](/en/features/common-data-model)
- An active JMS implementation

Additional prerequisites vary based on your JMS provider:

**Amazon SQS**

- An Amazon API access key and secret. Refer to the Amazon [Create new access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/create.keypair.html) guide to generate these values.

**Apache MQ JMS (ActiveMQ)**

- An ActiveMQ broker URL. Refer to the Apache [Broker URI](https://activemq.apache.org/components/classic/documentation/broker-uri) documentation for more information.

## How to connect to the JMS tools by Workato connector

Workato supports connections to the following JMS providers:

- [Amazon SQS](#connect-to-amazon-sqs-jms)
- [ActiveMQ](#connect-to-activemq-jms)
- You can connect to additional providers, such as IBM MQ and RabbitMQ, using the [custom](#connect-to-custom-jms) provider option.

### Connect to Amazon SQS JMS

Complete the following steps to connect to [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) JMS in Workato:

1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for and select `JMS by Workato` as your connection in the **New connection** page.
   
3. Provide a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.

4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Use the **On-prem group** drop-down menu to select the connection profile you plan to use.
   
6. Use the **Provider** drop-down menu to select **Amazon SQS**.
   
7. Use the **Region** drop-down menu to select your Amazon API region. For example, `us-east-2`.
   
8. Enter the Amazon API **Access key** and **Secret key**. Refer to the Amazon [Create new access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/create.keypair.html) guide to generate these values.
   
9. Click **Connect**.
   

### Connect to ActiveMQ JMS

Complete the following steps to connect to [Apache MQ JMS (ActiveMQ)](https://activemq.apache.org/components/classic/) in Workato:

> **ACTIVEMQ CLIENT**
> 
> The Workato on-prem agent (OPA) already contains an ActiveMQ client. Adding ActiveMQ client JAR files to the OPA `lib_ext` folder can cause conflicts with the existing client and unexpected connection behavior.

1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for and select `JMS by Workato` as your connection in the **New connection** page.
   
3. Provide a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
   
   ![ActiveMQ connection](/assets/activemq.BWT3UN0T.png)_ActiveMQ connection_
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Use the **On-prem group** drop-down menu to select the connection profile you plan to use.
   
6. Use the **Provider** drop-down menu to select **ActiveMQ**.
   
7. Enter the ActiveMQ broker **URL**. For example: `tcp://your-broker-host:port`. You can't use an embedded broker URL. This field doesn't support in-memory broker connections starting with `vm://`.
   
8. Optional. Expand the **Redelivery policy** section to configure JMS behavior when a message fails to deliver:
   
   1. Enter the **Maximum number of attempts** to allow before sending the message to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ). Enter `-1` for unlimited redeliveries.
      
   2. Enter the number of seconds to wait before attempting the first redelivery in the **Initial redelivery delay** field.
      
   3. Enter the maximum number of seconds to way before additional redelivery attempts in the **Maximum delivery delay** field. This value only applies when the **Delay multiplier** is greater than `1.0`.
      
   4. Enter the a multiplier to apply to the redelivery delay after each attempt in the **Delay multiplier** field. Values less than `1.0` result in a fixed redelivery delay.
      
   
   Example redelivery policy
   
   A redelivery policy with the following configuration attempts redelivery at 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds, and 40 seconds:
   
   **Maximum number of attempts**:
   
   \-1
   
   **Initial redelivery delay**:
   
   5
   
   **Maximum delivery delay**:
   
   40
   
   **Delay multiplier**:
   
   2.0
   
9. Click **Connect**.
   

### Connect to custom JMS

Complete the following steps to connect to a custom JMS provider:

1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for and select `JMS by Workato` as your connection in the **New connection** page.
   
3. Provide a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
   
   ![Custom connection](/assets/custom.tXt6TDAe.png)_Custom connection_
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Use the **On-prem group** drop-down menu to select the connection profile you plan to use.
   
6. Use the **Provider** drop-down menu to select **Custom**.
   
7. Enter the **ConnectionFactory implementation class**. For example, `org.apache.qpid.jms.JMSConnectionFactory`.
   
8. Enter the **Remote broker URI**. For example: `amqps://your-broker-host.servicebus.windows.net`.
   
   > **ACTIVEMQ CONNECTIONS**
   > 
   > The connection silently fails if you enter an ActiveMQ brokerURL in the **Remote broker URI** field. Leave this field blank and enter your brokerURL in the **Additional properties for custom JMS connection** section for ActiveMQ connections. For example, enter `brokerURL` as the **Key** and `tcp://your-broker-host:61616` as the **Value**.
   > 
   > ![Enter your brokerURL as an additional property](/assets/jms-brokerurl-property.CEjjHnEw.png)_Enter your brokerURL as an additional property._
   
9. Enter the **Username** and **Password** for your provider.
   
10. Optional. Expand to the **Additional properties for custom JMS connection** section and click **Add parameter** to add additional properties for your connection.
    
11. Click **Connect**.
