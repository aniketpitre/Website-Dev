### Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Project | Select the project to bill for the query. |
| Dataset | Select the dataset to pull tables from. |
| Table | Select the table inside the dataset. |
| Table Fields | _Only required if table ID is a datapill_. Select table fields to declare the columns of the table. This should be the same across all possible values of the datapill. |
| Unique key | Select values from this column to deduplicate rows in the selected table, making sure that the same row is not processed twice in the same recipe. Do not repeat the values in the selected column in your table. **This column must be of type integer.** |
| Output columns | After selecting your table, you can also select which columns you want returned. Selecting only what you need for your recipe increases job throughput and overall efficiency of the recipe. |
| WHERE condition | Refer to the [WHERE condition guide](/en/connectors/bigquery#where-condition) for more information. |
| Location | Select the geographical location of where the job should be run. This field isn't required in most cases. |
| Use Standard SQL | Specify whether to use Standard SQL or legacy SQL. |

### Output

| Columns | Workato introspects the table's schema and returns each column's value as a datapill. |

## New rows batch trigger

| Project | Select the project to bill for the query. |
| Dataset | Select the dataset to pull possible tables from. |

| Batch size | Select the batch size of the rows to be returned in each job. This can be anywhere from 1 to 50,000 with 50,000 being the default. Larger batch sizes will increase data throughput. If more new rows are found than the batch size, multiple jobs will be created until all new rows are processed. |
