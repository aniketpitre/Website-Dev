## How to connect to Box on Workato

The Box connector supports the following authentication methods:

- [Authorization code grant](#authorization-code-grant)
- [Client credentials](#client-credentials)

### Roles and permissions required to connect

Your Workato permissions match the permissions you have in Box. This means that you have the same capabilities to view, share, upload, and download files and folders in Workato that you have on the Box platform. Refer to [Box privileges and permissions](#box-privileges-and-permissions) for more information.

> **BOX REFRESH TOKEN**
> 
> Box Refresh Tokens enable you to acquire a new Access Token for Box. However, each Box Refresh Token is valid for only one use within a 60-day period. Consequently, if you maintain an active connection to Box but refrain from using any Box actions for 60 days, an error occurs when you try to perform a Box action.
> 
> Refer to the Box documentation to learn how to manage your access using [Box Refresh Tokens](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/tokens/refresh/).

## Working with attachments in Box

### Upload file content

You can upload plain text file content using this action.

1. Enter the text for your file in the **File Content** field.

3. Enter a **name** for the file, including the extension.
   
   ![Box Attachment 1](/assets/box_attachment_1.C2NPpZ7w.png)_Upload file content_
   

### Upload file from URL

You can upload a file directly from a URL rather than entering text content. This allows you to upload non-text files such as images.

1. Enter the URL for the file you plan to upload in the **Source URL** field. Attachment URLs typically end with the file extension for the file (such as .jpg).
   
   ![Box Attachment 2](/assets/box-upload-from-url.Bn55ZhdE.png)_Upload file from URL_
   
2. Select the **Destination folder** where you plan to upload your file. Note that entering a file name is optional as Workato obtains the name of the file from the URL by default.
   

## Create and use shared links to Box folder/file

The **Create shared link** action allows you to create a direct link to a file or folder in Box.

1. Enter the **file ID/folder ID** for the file/folder for which you plan to create a shared link.
   
2. Select an **access** level for the shared link (Open, Company, Collaborators, or Default). Refer to [Shared link permissions](#shared-link-permissions) for more information.
   
   - This sets restrictions on who can view your file/folder using the shared link. If you have a Premium Box subscription, you can also enter a password that link-users must enter before they can access your file/folder.
     
     ![Box Attachment 3](/assets/box_attachment_3.CIHPgnuq.png)_Create shared links_
     
3. Optional. Use the ID (Step 1) datapill from the trigger step to identify the new file when creating the shared URL link, and post the URL in the following schema to your Slack Workbot.
   
   ![Box Shared Link 1](/assets/box_shared_link_1.DgZgXYYd.png)![Box Shared Link 2](/assets/box_shared_link_2.DzWuFaa0.png)_Post the URL in Slack Workbot_
