## Connection setup

The Aconex connector supports the following authentication types:

- [OAuth 2.0 authentication](#oauth-2)
- [Basic authentication](#basic-auth)

### OAuth 2.0 authentication

Workato recommends using OAuth 2.0 authentication. OAuth 2.0 authentication provides security by using an access token to identify the authenticated user.

#### Set up OAuth 2.0 authentication
