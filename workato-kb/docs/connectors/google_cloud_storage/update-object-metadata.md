# Google Cloud Storage - Update object metadata action

This action updates an object’s metadata in your Google cloud storage instance.

For uploading object content and metadata use the [upload object action](/en/connectors/google_cloud_storage/upload-object-with-file-streaming).

## Input

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Bucket name **Required** | The name of the bucket to be updated. |
| Object name **Required** | The name of the object to be updated. |
| Pre-defined Access Controls | Select a pre-defined access control configuration. |
| Projection | Select the set of properties to return. Defaults to No ACL. |
| Generation | If present, permanently deletes a specific revision of this object (as opposed to the latest version, the default). |
| If generation matches | Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current generation matches the given value. Setting to 0 makes the operation succeed only if there are no live versions of the object. |
| If generation does not match | Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current generation does not match the given value. If no live object exists, the precondition fails. Setting to 0 makes the operation succeed only if there is a live version of the object. |
| If Meta generation matches | Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current metageneration matches the given value. |
| If Meta generation does not match | Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current metageneration does not match the given value. |

> **Pre-defined access controls**
> 
> These are the accepted configurations:
> 
> - **authenticatedRead**: Object owner gets `OWNER` access, and allAuthenticatedUsers get `READER` access.
> - **bucketOwnerFullControl**: Object owner gets `OWNER` access, and project workspace admins get `OWNER` access.
> - **bucketOwnerRead**: Object owner gets `OWNER` access, and project workspace admins get `READER` access.
> - **private**: Object owner gets `OWNER` access.
> - **projectPrivate**: Object owner gets `OWNER` access, and project workspace members get access according to their roles.
> - **publicRead**: Object owner gets `OWNER` access, and allUsers get `READER` access.
