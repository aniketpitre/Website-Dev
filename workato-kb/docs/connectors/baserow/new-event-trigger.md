# Baserow - New event trigger

The **New event** trigger monitors a Baserow table for newly created, updated, or deleted rows.

> **REGISTER THE WEBHOOK IN BASEROW**
> 
> This trigger uses a static webhook URL. Save the recipe, then copy the webhook URL from the trigger step. In Baserow, open the table's menu, go to **Webhooks**, and create a webhook pointing at that URL. Select the events you want to send, such as **rows.created**, **rows.updated**, and **rows.deleted**.

## Input

| Table ID | Select the table to receive events from. Register the webhook for this table in Baserow, as shown in the tip above. |
