# Baserow - List records action

The **List records** action returns a workspace's tables, or a table's fields, in Baserow. To list a table's rows instead, use the [Search records](/en/connectors/baserow/search-records-action) action.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Object type | Select the object type. Options are **Table** or **Field**. |
| Table ID | Select the table to list fields for. The **Table ID** field is required when **Object type** is **Field**. The **Table ID** isn't available when **Object type** is **Table**. |

## Output

Output fields dynamically generate based on the object type you select. The following are a representative set of output fields. Refer to the Baserow [Database API](https://baserow.io/docs/apis/rest-api) documentation for a list of output fields.
