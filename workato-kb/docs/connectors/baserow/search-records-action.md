# Baserow - Search records action

The **Search records** action retrieves a list of rows from a table in Baserow, with support for pagination, sorting, and filtering.

## Input

The following are a representative set of input fields. Refer to the Baserow [Database API](https://baserow.io/docs/apis/rest-api) documentation for a list of input fields.

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Object type | Select the object type, such as **Row**. |
| Table ID | Select the table to search. |
| Page | Optional. Enter the page of rows to return. The default is `1`. |

| Search | Optional. Enter a query. Only rows that match this query are returned. |

| Filters | Optional. Enter a JSON filter tree, for example, `{"filter_type":"AND","filters":[{"field":"Name","type":"equal","value":"test"}]}`. **Filter type** and **Field filters** are ignored when this filter is set. |
| Field filters | Optional. Add field, operator, and value combinations to filter by, for example, field `Name`, operator `equal`, value `test`. This filter is ignored if **Filters** is set. |
