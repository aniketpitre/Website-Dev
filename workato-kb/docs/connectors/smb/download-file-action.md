> The Download file action in the SMB connector lets you download a file from your network share in binary mode using file streaming for use downstream.

# SMB - Download file action

This action downloads a file from your SMB network share in binary mode. The file contents can be used in downstream recipe steps. This action cannot be used to download entire folders.

To process this action, Workato splits the file contents into chunks and downloads them across separate requests in a technique called [file streaming](/en/features/file-streaming). The time it takes to process the action depends on the file size and the download speed.

The default chunk size is set to 5 MB. You can change the chunk size to increase the download speed if your connection is stable. The maximum chunk size is 100 MB.
