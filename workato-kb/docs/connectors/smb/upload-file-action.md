> The Upload file action in the SMB connector lets you upload a file to a specific path in your network share, overwriting any file with the same name.

# SMB - Upload file action

This action uploads a file to a specific path in your SMB network share. If a file with the same name already exists in the folder, the action overwrites it.

The default chunk size is set to 5 MB. You can change the chunk size to increase the upload speed if your connection is stable. The maximum chunk size is 100 MB.

You can use this action with the [Create folder](/en/connectors/smb/create-folder) action to upload files into a new folder.
