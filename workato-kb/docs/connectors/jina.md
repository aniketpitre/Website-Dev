> Prepare clean, LLM-ready content from the web with Jina's Search Foundation APIs, then embed, rerank, or classify the results in your recipes.

# Jina

[Jina AI](https://jina.ai) provides Search Foundation APIs for reading web pages, transforming web pages into LLM-friendly markdown, web search, text segmentation, embeddings, reranking, classification, and DeepSearch research. The Jina connector lets you read, search, and process text and web content for LLM and search workflows.

Use the Jina connector to:

- Read a URL and convert it into clean markdown or JSON.
- Search the web and return LLM-friendly results.
- Segment text into tokenized chunks.
- Generate vector embeddings for text.
- Rerank documents by relevance to a query.
- Classify text with zero-shot or few-shot labels.
- Run a DeepSearch chat completion for research tasks.

You can also use [custom actions](/en/developing-connectors/custom-actions) to build a custom HTTP request to any Jina API endpoint. Refer to the Jina [API documentation](https://api.jina.ai/scalar) for endpoint details.
