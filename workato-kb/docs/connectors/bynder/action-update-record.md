# Bynder - Update record action

This action allows you to update the values or content of any existing `asset` or `collection`.

Note that updating an asset in Bynder requires the `MEDIAEDIT` security role and the `MARKPUBLIC` security role in order to change an asset's `isPublic` state.

Updating collection in Bynder also requires the `COLLECTIONS` security role and the `PUBLISHCOLLECTIONS` security role in order to change a collection's `isPublic` state.
