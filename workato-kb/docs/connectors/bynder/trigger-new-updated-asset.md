# Bynder - New/updated asset trigger

Triggers when a new asset is added to the Bynder account or existing asset in the Bynder account is updated. Trigger will pick up new assets created from the time recipe has started. Checks for new assets every 5 minutes.

Bynder allows an asset to be updated by having multiple versions. You can update the original file in Bynder while keeping all the metaproperties, tags and other information the asset is tagged with as well as any attached additional files and manual derivatives.

Refer to the Bynder [Upload New Version of an Asset](https://support.bynder.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013931859-Upload-a-New-Version) tutorial to learn how to add a new version of the asset.

This trigger supports [Trigger conditions](/en/recipes/triggers#trigger-conditions), which can filter incoming trigger events.

The trigger event contains only metadata about the file, however, such as file name and size. To retrieve content of the file, use the **Download asset in Bynder** action.
