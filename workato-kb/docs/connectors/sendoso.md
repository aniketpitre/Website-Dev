## Using Sendoso with other apps

Sendoso is frequently used in recipes with a CRM app, such as in the following example recipes:

- [Send gift to new/updated opportunity](https://app.workato.com/recipes/1481742?st=df8655): sends a gift to a contact from Microsoft Dynamics 365 if the opportunity is valued at $10000 or more.
- [Update Microsoft Dynamics 365 with gift status](https://app.workato.com/recipes/1487243?st=226020): whenever a gift is sent, clicked, or delivered, creates a new contact in Microsoft Dynamics 365 or updates an existing contact and adds a note with the gift status.

> **TIP**
> 
> The Send Analytics trigger output contains the gift recipient’s email but not their name. If Microsoft Dynamics 365 doesn't have a contact with a matching email address, a new contact will be created in Dynamics with the recipient's email as the contact name.
