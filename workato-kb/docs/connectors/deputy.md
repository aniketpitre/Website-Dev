# Deputy

[Deputy](https://deputy.com/) is an all-in-one employee scheduling, time and attendance tracking, tasking, communication, and compliance platform.

## API version

The Deputy connector uses the [Deputy V1 REST API](https://www.deputy.com/api-doc/API/) with the base URL of `https://{baseURI}.deputy.com/api/v1`.

## How to connect to Deputy on Workato

The Deputy connector supports both OAuth2.0 and permanent access token authentications.

### OAuth2.0 authentication

When authenticating through OAuth2.0, follow these steps:

1. Log into your Deputy instance using the account username and password in a separate window.
2. Select the organization accessible to Workato.

### Permanent access token authentication

To set up permanent access token authentication, follow these steps:

2. Navigate to the Workato connections setup page, and start a new connection.
3. Use the token to fill the **Permanent access token** field.
4. Specify the base URI found in the URL of your workspace in the **Endpoint** field. For example, if your workspace URL is `eafaf305033125.na.deputy.com`, then enter `eafaf305033125.na`.
