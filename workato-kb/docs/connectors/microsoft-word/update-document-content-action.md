# Microsoft Word - Update document content action

The **Update document content** action applies block-level operations, such as insert, replace, or delete by element ID, or replaces the full document content.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| File source | Select where the document is stored. Options are **OneDrive** and **SharePoint**. |
| Document | Select the Word document from a folder-tree list scoped to the file source you selected. |
| Update mode | Choose how to update. **Block operations** applies targeted changes by element ID. **Full replace (XML)** and **Full replace (binary)** accept raw content. |
| Operation type | Select the type of block operation to perform. Options are **Replace**, **Delete**, **Insert before**, **Insert after**, **Insert at start**, and **Insert at end**. The **Operation type** field is only available when **Update mode** is **Block operations**. |
| Element ID | Enter the element ID of the block to target. The **Element ID** field is only available when **Update mode** is **Block operations**. |
| Content XML | Enter the raw XML content for the block. The **Content XML** field is only available when **Update mode** is **Block operations**, and it's mutually exclusive with **Block structure**. **Delete** operations don't require this field. |
| Block structure | Build content with structured fields instead of raw XML, such as block type, text, heading level, list type, or nesting level. Provide table rows for table blocks. The **Block structure** field is only available when **Update mode** is **Block operations**, and it takes precedence over **Content XML**. |
| ETag | Optional. Provide the ETag from a previous action. The update fails if the document was modified since you provided this value. |
