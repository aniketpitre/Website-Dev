# Cisco Webex Teams - New message trigger (real-time)

This trigger monitors new messages in your Cisco Webex Teams instance in real-time. Workato processes each message as a separate job.

> **USING THIS TRIGGER WITH BOT ACCESS TOKEN AUTHENTICATION**
> 
> To ensure new messages sent to the bot are processed, tag the bot in the message. For example, `@bot_name new message`.
> 
> Additionally, due to API response times, this trigger may experience delays. To minimize delays, bot users should avoid sending messages less than three seconds apart. If a message doesn’t trigger a job, try sending another message to process the previous job.
