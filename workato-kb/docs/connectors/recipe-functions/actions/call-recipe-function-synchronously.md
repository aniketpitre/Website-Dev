# Recipe function by Workato - Call recipe synchronously action

This action calls a Recipe function and waits for the response before proceeding to the next step in the recipe.

* * *

## Requirements

To use this action, you need a [Recipe function](/en/connectors/recipe-functions). This is a recipe that uses the [**Recipe functions - New function call**](/en/connectors/recipe-functions/triggers/new-function-call) trigger and can be called from other recipes.

* * *

## Limitations

When using this action, note that:

- **This action is subject to a timeout limit.** If the [timeout limit](/en/recipes/jobs#timeouts) is exceeded, the job will fail. You can reduce the likelihood of timeout errors by [calling the recipe function asynchronously](/en/connectors/recipe-functions/actions/call-recipe-function-asynchronously).
- This action can cause "job out of order" behavior. Although it is not a long action, it can cause jobs to process out of order. This occurs when multiple recipe functions are invoked within a parent recipe. For more information on this behavior when using concurrency, refer to the [concurrency](/en/recipes/settings#concurrency) documentation.
