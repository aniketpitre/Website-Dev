# Recipe function by Workato - New call for function trigger

This trigger allows you to build a recipe that can be called from another recipe. When naming the recipe, keep in mind that the recipe name is what displays in the **Recipe function** menu of the [**Call recipe synchronously**](/en/connectors/recipe-functions/actions/call-recipe-function-synchronously) and [**asynchronously**](/en/connectors/recipe-functions/actions/call-recipe-function-asynchronously) actions.

**Note**: This trigger partially replaces the [Callable Recipes - New call for recipe trigger](/en/features/callable-recipes/new-call-trigger). Use the [API platform - New API request trigger](/en/api-mgmt/api-recipes/trigger-new-api-request) to trigger recipes based on API requests.
