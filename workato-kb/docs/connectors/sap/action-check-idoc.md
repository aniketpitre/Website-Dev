# SAP - Check IDoc status action

![Action Check IDoc Status](/assets/action-check-idoc.DgtOcfVZ.png)

This action allows you to check if an IDoc is successfully processed in SAP, after being sent from Workato.

Workato automatically attaches a unique **Submission ID** to your IDoc when you use the [Send IDoc](/en/connectors/sap/action-send-idoc) action. Use this **Submission ID** in the following input field:

> **ERROR BEHAVIOR**
> 
> IDocs are processed asynchronously in SAP. Use this action to detect business failures that occur after SAP accepts an IDoc. Refer to [Error behavior in the SAP RFC connector](/en/connectors/sap/sap-error-behavior) for details on how technical and business errors surface for IDoc-based integrations.
