> The Send IDoc (Advanced) action in the SAP connector sends IDocs to an on-premise SAP system without the dummy configurations the legacy action required.

# SAP - Send IDoc (Advanced) action

This action allows you to send IDoc to an on-premise SAP system or a SAP system on a server behind the corporate firewall. You must [configure IDocs in your SAP system](/en/connectors/sap/configure-idoc-sap) before using this action. This action removes the need for dummy configurations that were previously required for the Legacy Send IDoc action.

> **MINIMUM OPA VERSION REQUIRED**
> 
> This action is available only in OPA v28.1 and later. This action is designed to support expected SAP behavior and address advanced use cases.

## Input

| Field name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Partner type | Choose a partner type: AD = Address, B = Bank, BP = Benefits Provider, GP = Business Partner, KU = Customer, LI = Vendor, LS = Logical System, US = User. |
| Partner profile | Select the sender partner number as maintained in transaction WE20. |
| Message type | Select the IDoc message type defined in transaction WE20 maintained in the partner number selected in the preceding steps. For example, `ORDERS`, `INVOIC`. |
| Basic type and extension | Choose the appropriate IDoc type and extension configured in SAP for a particular message type selected in the preceding steps. |
| Wait for SAP to process the IDoc? | IDoc is processed asynchronously in SAP. This means you can configure the recipe to wait for the processing to finish before moving on to the next recipe step. |
| Check IDoc status every | This field appears if **Wait for SAP to process the IDoc** is set to **Yes**. Select how often Workato should call SAP. This is useful when you want to control the workload of your SAP system. |

> **ERROR BEHAVIOR**
> 
> The Send IDoc (Advanced) action confirms that SAP accepted the IDoc at a technical level. A successful step doesn't indicate that SAP completed business processing. Business failures may surface later through IDoc status tracking rather than as step-level errors. Refer to [Error behavior in the SAP RFC connector](/en/connectors/sap/sap-error-behavior) for details.
