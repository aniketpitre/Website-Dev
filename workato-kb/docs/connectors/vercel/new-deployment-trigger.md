# Vercel - New deployment trigger

The **New deployment** trigger checks Vercel for new deployments and starts a recipe for each one.

## Input

| Input field | Description |

| Project ID | Optional. Select a project to limit the trigger to that project. |
| State | Optional. Select a deployment state to filter by. Vercel checks the state when the trigger polls, so a deployment that is still building when the trigger polls isn't picked up later. Leave this field blank to catch every new deployment. |
