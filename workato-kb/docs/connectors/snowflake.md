> Connect to Snowflake to build powerful data workflows.

# Snowflake

Snowflake is a relational ANSI SQL data warehouse built for the cloud. Its unique architecture enables faster performance, ease of use, and greater flexibility than traditional data warehouses.

> **SUMMARY**
> 
> - To connect to Snowflake on Workato, you can use OAuth 2.0 or key-pair authentication.
> - You must allowlist [Workato IP addresses](/en/security/ip-allowlists) if your Snowflake instance has network policies that restrict access based on IP address.
> - The Snowflake connector supports operations such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
> - Create custom roles to restrict Workato's access to only the Snowflake objects you want to build recipes with.
> - You can use parameters in conjunction with `WHERE` conditions for security against SQL injection.

> **USERNAME/PASSWORD AUTHENTICATION DEPRECATION**
> 
> Snowflake plans to deprecate single-factor password authentication for users by **October 2026**. Refer to [Snowflake's official deprecation announcement](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/blocking-single-factor-password-authentification/) for more information.
> 
> We strongly encourage you to migrate all existing **Username/Password** connections to **OAuth 2.0** or **Key-pair authentication** before this date. Existing **Username/Password** connections will remain operational until the deprecation date.

## Use cases

Integrate Snowflake with your existing apps to build powerful data workflows. You can automate data validation, improve lead tracking, and enhance decision-making with the Snowflake connector. Explore our [use cases](/en/getting-started/workato-use-cases) to discover how you can streamline your Snowflake processes:

- [Validate Salesforce contact information](/en/getting-started/use-cases/salesforce-js-snippets-snowflake-email) with JavaScript and upsert the data to Snowflake.
- [Create Salesforce tasks and Snowflake rows](/en/getting-started/use-cases/marketo-salesforce-snowflake) from Marketo lead activity.

## Connection setup

The Snowflake connector supports the following authentication types:

- [OAuth 2.0](#configuring-oauth-2-0)
- [Key-pair authentication](#configure-private-key-authentication)

### OAuth 2.0 authentication

You must create a custom integration and generate a client ID and secret in Snowflake to use OAuth 2.0 authentication.

#### Snowflake setup for OAuth 2.0 authentication

Complete the following steps to create a custom integration and retrieve client credentials in Snowflake:

1. Run the following SQL command in Snowflake to register a custom OAuth integration:
   
   ```sql
   CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION WORKATO_OAUTH
     TYPE = OAUTH
     ENABLED = TRUE
     OAUTH_CLIENT = CUSTOM
     OAUTH_CLIENT_TYPE = CONFIDENTIAL
     OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI = 'https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback'
     OAUTH_ISSUE_REFRESH_TOKENS = TRUE;
   ```
   
   > **REQUIRED PRIVILEGE**
   > 
   > Use the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role or a role with the global `CREATE INTEGRATION` privilege to run this command.
   
2. Run the following command to retrieve your client credentials:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT SYSTEM$SHOW_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS('WORKATO_OAUTH');
   ```
   
   Refer to the Snowflake [Configure Snowflake OAuth for custom clients](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/oauth-custom.html) guide for more information.
   
3. Copy and save the **Client ID** and **Client secret** for use in Workato.

   ![Snowflake OAuth 2.0 connection](/assets/connection.BBLDp5Fr.png)_Snowflake OAuth 2.0 connection_
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Enter the Snowflake instance **Account identifier** in one of the supported formats:
   
   - **Account name**: `https://{org_name}-{account_name}`
   - **Connection name**: `https://{org_name}-{connection_name}`
   - **Account locator**: `https://{account_locator}.{region}.{cloud}`
   
   Refer to the Snowflake [Connecting to your accounts](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/organizations-connect#connecting-with-a-url) guide for more information.
   
   > **ACCOUNT LOCATOR FORMAT**
   > 
   > Certain locations require you to include the `{region}` and `{cloud}` in your account locator URL. For example:
   > 
   > - **AWS US West (Oregon)**: `your-account-locator`
   > - **AWS US East (Ohio)**: `your-account-locator.us-east-2`
   > - **Azure West Europe**: `your-account-locator.west-europe.azure`
   > 
   > Refer to the Snowflake [Using an account locator as an identifier](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier#using-an-account-locator-as-an-identifier) guide for more information.
   
6. Enter the **Warehouse** name to define the compute resources for this connection. Refer to [Warehouse considerations](/en/connectors/snowflake#warehouse-considerations) for more information.
   
7. Enter the **Database name** for the target Snowflake database.
   
8. Use the **Authentication type** drop-down menu to select **OAuth 2.0**.
   
9. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client secret**. Refer to [Snowflake setup for OAuth 2.0 authentication](#oauth2-setup) for information on how to retrieve these credentials.
   
10. Optional. Specify a **Role** for authentication. This role must be an existing role assigned to the user. If left blank, Snowflake uses the default role assigned to the user.
    
11. Optional. Enter the **Schema**. If left blank, the default schema is public.
    
12. Optional. Set the **Use improved datetime handling (Recommended)** to **Yes** to ensure correct timezone handling for timestamps.
    
13. Optional. Define the **Database timezone** to apply to timestamps without an assigned timezone. Defaults to your workspace's timezone if left blank.
    
14. Click **Connect**.
    
15. Click **Allow** to provision access to Workato.
    

### Key-pair authentication

Use key-pair authentication to connect to Snowflake without a password. This method uses a client-generated RSA key pair and provides strong security. You must use a command-line tool to generate the key pair.

#### Snowflake setup for key-pair authentication

Complete the following steps to create a key pair in Snowflake:

1. Run one of the following commands in a terminal to generate a private key.
   
   **Unencrypted**
   
   Generate an unencrypted private key:
   
   ```bash
   openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -out rsa_key.p8 -nocrypt
   ```
   
   **Encrypted v1**
   
   Generate an encrypted private key using a `-v1` algorithm:
   
   ```bash
   openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -v1 <ALGORITHM> -inform PEM -out rsa_key.p8
   ```
   
   You can use the following `-v1` algorithms:
   
   - `PBE-SHA1-RC2-40`
   - `PBE-SHA1-RC4-40`
   - `PBE-SHA1-RC2-128`
   - `PBE-SHA1-RC4-128`
   - `PBE-SHA1-3DES`
   - `PBE-SHA1-2DES`
   
   **Encrypted v2**
   
   Generate an encrypted private key using a stronger `-v2` algorithm:
   
   ```bash
   openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -v2 <ALGORITHM> -inform PEM -out rsa_key.p8
   ```
   
   You can use the following `-v2` algorithms:
   
   - `AES128`
   - `AES256`
   - `DES3`
   
   > **PRIVATE KEY PASSPHRASE**
   > 
   > If you generate an encrypted private key, you must enter the **Private key passphrase** when you configure the connection in Workato.
   
2. Copy and save the **PRIVATE KEY** for use in Workato. Copy everything from `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` to `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`.
   
3. Run the following command to create a public key from the private key. OpenSSL prompts you for the passphrase if you generated an encrypted private key.
   
   ```bash
   openssl rsa -in rsa_key.p8 -pubout -out rsa_key.pub
   ```
   
4. Copy and save the **PUBLIC KEY** for use in the next step.
   
   Refer to the Snowflake [Key-pair authentication and key-pair rotation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth) guide for more information.
   
5. Run the following SQL command in a Snowflake worksheet to assign the public key to your Snowflake user:
   
   ```sql
   ALTER USER <USERNAME> SET RSA_PUBLIC_KEY='<PUBLIC_KEY>';
   ```
   
   Replace `<USERNAME>` with your Snowflake user and `<PUBLIC_KEY>` with the key content. Exclude the `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----` and `-----END PUBLIC KEY-----` lines.
   
   > **ROLE REQUIREMENT**
   > 
   > You must have the `SYSADMIN` or `SECURITYADMIN` role to run this command.

### Warehouse considerations

Snowflake uses per-second billing for all compute (loading, transforming, and querying), with a 60-second minimum each time a warehouse starts. Select warehouse properties based on query frequency, time between queries, number of concurrent active recipes, and query complexity.

#### Warehouse size

An **X-Small** warehouse is sufficient for most use cases. Larger warehouses complete queries faster at the same credit cost, making them better suited for long or complex queries where timeouts are a concern.

#### Multi-cluster warehouses

Multi-cluster warehouses with auto-scale enabled handle temporary load fluctuations by creating additional warehouses of the same size as needed. Use a multi-cluster warehouse if you expect concurrent jobs or jobs with large queries. Refer to the Snowflake [Multi-cluster warehouses](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/warehouses-multicluster.html) guide for more information.

#### Auto-suspend and auto-resume

Warehouses used in the connection must have auto-resume enabled — recipe jobs fail when attempting to run on a suspended warehouse.

You can configure a warehouse to auto-suspend after a period of inactivity based on your business needs. Keep in mind that warehouses maintain a cache of table data that improves query performance, but this cache is cleared on suspension. As a result, initial queries after auto-resume are slower. Use cases with frequent queries and minimal downtime between them benefit from a longer auto-suspend period.

### Database timezone

Snowflake TIMESTAMP\_NTZ data type stores "wallclock" time without timezone information, which can cause issues when integrating with external systems. When sending or reading data from these columns, the values must be converted to a default timezone for other applications to process accurately. To address this, select the timezone your database operates in — this applies only to TIMESTAMP\_NTZ columns. Columns with explicit timezone values are unaffected.

> **DEFAULT TIMEZONE**
> 
> Your workspace's timezone is used by default when the database timezone isn't specified.

- _Writing_ timestamp values to TIMESTAMP\_NTZ: Timestamp values are converted to the specified timezone (including DST offset where applicable) before storing only the wallclock value.
- _Reading_ timestamps from TIMESTAMP\_NTZ: Timestamp values are assigned the selected timezone and processed as timezone-aware timestamps, with DST offset applied where applicable.

### Table and view

The Snowflake connector works with all tables and views available to the username used to establish the connection. These are available in drop-down menus in each trigger/action, or you can provide the exact name.

![Table selection from pick list](/assets/table_pick_list.DyEcMLkI.png)_Select a table/view from the drop-down menu_

![Exact table name provided](/assets/table_name_text.DHxyampL.png)_Provide exact table/view name in a text field_

### Single row and batch of rows

The Snowflake connector supports reading and writing data as a single row or in batches. Batch triggers and actions require a batch size between 1 and 100, and return a list datapill (an array of rows) rather than a single row output.

![Batch trigger output](/assets/new-batch-of-rows-trigger.BkXQMkNN.png)_Batch trigger output_

> **List datapill**
> 
> The Rows datapill indicates that the output is a list containing data for each row in that batch.

Single-row triggers return an output datatree for mapping individual row data, while batch triggers return a list datapill that must be handled differently.

![Single row output](/assets/single_row_trigger_output.Hv0UepZE.png)_Single row output_

Map the Rows datapill into the source list with batch-compatible operations, such as the Salesforce **Create objects in bulk** action. Refer to [Work with lists in Workato](/en/features/list-management#using-datapills-from-lists) for more information.

![Using batch trigger output](/assets/using_batch_output.BSaq9Sta.png)_Using batch trigger output_

### WHERE condition

Use this input field to filter and identify rows to perform an action on. It's used in multiple triggers and actions in the following ways:

- Filter rows to be picked up in triggers
- Filter rows in **Select rows** action
- Filter rows to be deleted in **Delete rows** action

> **TIP**
> 
> The following examples showcase how to use WHERE conditions directly with user input. For added security, use WHERE conditions with parameters to prevent SQL injection. Refer to [Use parameters](#use-parameters) for more information.

Use this clause as a `WHERE` statement in each request. This should follow basic SQL syntax.

#### Simple statements

String values must be enclosed in single quotes (`''`) and columns used must exist in the table/view.

A simple `WHERE` condition to filter rows based on values in a single column looks like this.

```sql
email = 'John@acme.com'
```

If used in a **Select rows** action, this `WHERE` condition returns all rows that have the value 'John@acme.com' in the `email` column. Wrap datapills with single quotes in your inputs.

![Using datapills in WHERE condition](/assets/use_datapill_in_where.D_cFCpNI.png)_Using datapills wrapped with single quotes in `WHERE` condition_

If your column contains spaces, use the column identifier — double quotes (`""`). For example, **currency code** must be enclosed in double quotes to be used as an identifier.

```sql
"email address" = 'John@acme.com'
```

![WHERE condition with enclosed identifier](/assets/where-condition-with-enclosed-identifier.DN2tKYO-.png)_`WHERE` condition with column identifier enclosed with double quotes_

#### Complex statements

The `WHERE` condition can also contain subqueries. The following example selects active users from the `USERS` table.

```sql
ID IN(SELECT USER_ID FROM USERS WHERE ACTIVE = TRUE)
```

When used in a **Select rows** action, this selects all rows from your main query that are related to rows in the `USERS` table and are active (`ACTIVE = TRUE`).

![Using subquery in WHERE condition](/assets/subquery-in-where-condition.DbOemvjv.png)_Using subquery in WHERE condition_

## Use Parameters

Use parameters in conjunction with `WHERE` conditions to add an additional layer of security against SQL injection. To use parameters in your `WHERE` conditions, you first need to declare bind variables in your input. Bind parameters must be declared in the form `:bind_variable` where the variable name is preceded with a `:`. When this is done, declare the parameter in the following section using the exact name you've given.

> **TIP**
> 
> Bind variables should only be used in place of column values and not column names.

![WHERE condition with bind variable](/assets/where-condition-with-bind-variable.CdW0wsTr.png)_`WHERE` condition with bind variable_

You can provide any number of bind variables, and each one should have a unique name. Workato distinguishes bind variables from column names and static values by ignoring any `:` inside single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`) and square brackets (`[]`).

## Special characters

When column names are defined with special characters, datapills for such columns aren't mapped correctly to the original column and return `null`. The most commonly used special characters are `whitespace` and `-`. Examples of these definitions are "column name" and "column-name".

The following workarounds are available for these situations.

### Workaround 1

Use an appropriate alias in the SQL statement. Datapills are mapped correctly to the alias.

```sql
SELECT ID, NAME
"whitespace column" as whitespace_column,
"dashed-column" as dashed_column
FROM CUSTOMERS
```

### Workaround 2

Access the value directly using the row index and column name.
