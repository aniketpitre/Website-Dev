# Microsoft Teams

[Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) is a central, digital collaboration platform that integrates workspace chat, video conferencing, file storage, and application integration into one hub. It's designed for hybrid work, allowing teams to communicate, share files, and manage projects in real-time across desktop, mobile, and web.

## Connection setup

The Microsoft Teams connector supports the following authentication types:

- [Authorization code grant authentication (OAuth 2.0)](#authentication-auth-code)
- [Client credentials-based authentication (OAuth 2.0)](#authentication-client-credentials): _Only available for tenant-specific connections_

> **MICROSOFT MFA ENFORCEMENT**
> 
> Microsoft is rolling out mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA) gradually to different applications and accounts in phases. This enforcement continues throughout 2025 and beyond. Refer to the Microsoft [Mandatory multifactor authentication for Azure and admin portals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication?tabs=dotnet) documentation for more information.
> 
> We strongly recommend enabling MFA now for all Microsoft accounts used with Workato to avoid service disruptions from short-notice enforcement changes.
> 
> Complete the following steps to maintain uninterrupted service:
> 
> 1. Enable MFA for your Microsoft organization following the Microsoft MFA setup guide. Refer to [Set up multifactor authentication for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide) for more information.
>    
> 2. Reconnect your Microsoft connection in Workato.
>    
> 3. Complete the OAuth flow with MFA when prompted.
>    
> 4. Test your recipes to ensure they work with the updated connection.
