# Amazon SNS - New message trigger

The **New message** trigger monitors a message topic and fetches new messages. Workato processes each message as a new job.

> **429 RESPONSES**
> 
> Amazon SNS treats a `429` (Too Many Requests) response as a successful delivery when using the **New message** trigger. Events that receive a `429` response aren't retried or sent to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).
> 
> Throttle message delivery using the SNS topic's delivery policy to align with Workato's [rate limits](/en/troubleshooting/webhook-gateway-limits#webhook-gateway-limits) and prevent event loss. AWS SNS doesn't treat a `429` as a failure and doesn't trigger retries. You can set the `throttlePolicy` to `maxReceivesPerSecond` to control delivery rate. Refer to the [AWS SNS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-message-delivery-retries.html#delivery-policy-maximum-receive-rate) for more information.
