# RPA by Workato

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) uses bots to automate repetitive, rules-based tasks. RPA bots can learn to perform tasks such as data entry, web scraping, content tagging, and spreadsheet updates by interacting with a computer screen the same way a human does. By automating these tasks, RPA reduces human errors and boosts efficiency.

RPA by Workato is a complete RPA solution in partnership with [Robotiq.ai](https://robotiq.ai/), an industry-agnostic, enterprise-ready RPA client. You can use the RPA by Workato connector to integrate with applications that don't have APIs, including legacy systems such as older SAP platforms, desktop applications, and browser apps without API support. Contact your Workato Customer Success Representative for more information.

## Key features

The RPA by Workato connector offers the following key features:
