> The Search custom records action in the NetSuite REST connector lets you search and filter custom records in NetSuite.

# NetSuite REST - Search custom records action

The **Search custom records** action allows you to search for custom records in NetSuite REST. You can either enter a **Search query** or use the **Search settings** input fields to filter records. Workato prioritizes the **Search query** field if you specify both.

You can only use fields with known data types to filter the input fields. Use a custom **Search query** to filter by other fields.

> **PREREQUISITES**

> You must complete the following before you use this action:
