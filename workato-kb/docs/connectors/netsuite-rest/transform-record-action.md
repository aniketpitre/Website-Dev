# NetSuite REST - Transform record action

The **Transform record** action transforms an existing record into another record type in NetSuite REST.

Use this action to create a target record from an existing source record. For example, you can transform a cash sale into a return authorization when NetSuite supports that transformation pair.

The available **Transform to** options depend on the selected **Source record**. After you select **Transform to**, the action displays additional fields that match the selected target record type.

Refer to the [Supported transformation types](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_4267258715.html) for valid source-to-target combinations. For setup requirements, see [REST Web Services prerequisites and setup](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/article_5085602973.html).
