# PipelineOps by Workato - Sync completed trigger (real-time)

The **Sync completed** trigger initiates a recipe in real-time after a data pipeline completes its sync. You can use this trigger to orchestrate actions based on the results of your pipeline runs, such as sending alerts, logging sync statuses, or triggering downstream processes.

This trigger only monitors scheduled syncs (full or incremental). Re-syncs are excluded.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Data pipeline | Choose the pipeline to monitor. Only pipelines configured in your project appear. |
| Trigger on | Select **Every sync completion** to capture all syncs, or **Failed syncs** to monitor only failed ones. |

Workato recommends using **Every sync completion** to ensure you capture all failure scenarios, including object-level issues.

## Output

| Pipeline ID | ID of the data pipeline. |
| Sync ID | ID of the specific sync run. |
| Source | Source system of the data pipeline. |
| Destination | Destination system of the data pipeline. |
| Started at | Timestamp when the sync began. |
