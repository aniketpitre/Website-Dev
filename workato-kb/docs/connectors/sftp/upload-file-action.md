> The Upload file action in the SFTP connector uploads a file to a path on your SFTP server, appending to or overwriting an existing file.

# SFTP - Upload file action

This action uploads a file to a specific path in your SFTP server. If the file already exists, the action will append or overwrite the file, depending on the option selected. Otherwise, it will create a new file.

You can use this action with the [Create folder](/en/connectors/sftp/create-folder-action) action to upload files into a new folder.
