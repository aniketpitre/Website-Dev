# SFTP - Download file action

This action downloads a file from your SFTP server in binary mode. The file contents can be used in downstream recipe steps. Note that this action cannot be used to download entire folders.

To process this action, Workato splits the file contents into chunks and downloads them across separate requests in a technique called [file streaming](/en/features/file-streaming). The time it takes to process the action depends on the file size and the download speed.

If your SFTP server does not support multipart downloads, and the file size is **200 MB** or less, set the **Download file in one go** option to **Yes**. Workato will fetch the entire file in a single request.

> **DOWNLOAD SMALL AND LARGE FILES**
> 
> Workato unified the **Download file** and **Download large file** actions into a single action called **Download file**, which supports small and large files.
