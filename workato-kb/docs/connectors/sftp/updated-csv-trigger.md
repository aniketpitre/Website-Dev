> The New/updated CSV file in directory trigger in the SFTP connector fires when a CSV file is created or updated in a directory, processing rows in batches.

# SFTP - New/updated CSV file in directory trigger (batch)

This trigger is activated when a CSV file is created or updated in a specified directory. Workato collates CSV lines and processes them in batches. Each batch is processed as a job. The default batch size is `100` and max batch size is `1000`.

> **PREVENTING TRIGGER ERRORS**
> 
> This trigger monitors the entire folder and parses the CSV content in the new or updated file before validating the trigger conditions. Therefore, adding a file with a different CSV format (header names, column count) from one provided in the trigger might lead to errors in the job. To prevent trigger errors, ensure that only the files with the CSV format that matches the trigger conditions are added to the folder.

## Output

The output of this trigger is a **list of records**, with each record containing the schema as defined in the **CSV column names**. Because this is a list datapill, you must use a [repeat action](/en/recipes/steps#repeat-step) to iterate through each record.

| --- | --- |
| Filename | The filename of the CSV. |
| First batch | Whether this is the first batch of CSV rows. |
| Last batch | Whether this is the last batch of CSV rows. |
| Lines | A [list datapill](/en/features/list-management) representing the list of records. |
