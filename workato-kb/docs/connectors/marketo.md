## API version

The Marketo connector uses [Marketo REST API v1](https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/).

## Connection setup

The Marketo connector uses custom authentication.

> **CUSTOM SERVICE CLIENTS**
> 
> Marketo exposes REST endpoints to enable integration platforms like Workato to remotely access and execute core functionalities. We recommend you create a custom service client specifically for Workato to facilitate this integration.
> 
> Key benefits of using a custom service client include:
> 
> - **Isolated logging**: All operations are logged under a dedicated custom service client for integration and workflow processes. This approach enhances tracking and troubleshooting by isolating issues related to specific integration platforms.
> - **Customized permissions**: A custom service client allows for tailored permissions and security profiles, independent of individual employee user accounts.
> 
> Ensure that the custom service client is granted all necessary permissions to perform the required actions for your integration scenario. If a `403` error occurs during recipe execution, it indicates that the service client lacks the appropriate permissions for the action.
