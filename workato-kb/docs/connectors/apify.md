> Use the Apify connector in Workato to find Actors, run them, and map dataset items into recipe steps.

# Apify

[Apify](https://apify.com) is a marketplace of hosted scrapers (Actors) plus dataset storage. The Apify connector lets you find public Actors, start runs, wait for results, and pull structured dataset items into your recipes.

Use the Apify connector to:

- Discover public store Actors, then look up an Actor, build, or run by ID.
- Start an Actor and pull the structured dataset items it produces.
- Wait for a long-running Actor to finish, then map its results into later recipe steps.
- Start a recipe when an Actor run finishes, and fetch its default dataset in a follow-on step.
