# Firecrawl

[Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev) turns websites into clean, AI-ready data. The Firecrawl connector lets you scrape, crawl, and search the web, and extract structured data from pages.

Use the Firecrawl connector to:

- Scrape a page to markdown, HTML, JSON, or a full-page screenshot.
- Run an Agent extraction job with a prompt, optionally constrained by a JSON schema, and check its status.
- Crawl a domain, and check the crawl job's status and page data.
- Map a site to return all of its discovered URLs.
- Search the live web for pages, news, or images.
- Detect whether a page changed since the last scrape.

You can also use [custom actions](/en/developing-connectors/custom-actions) to build a custom HTTP request to any Firecrawl API endpoint. Refer to the Firecrawl [API documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/v2-introduction) for endpoint details.
