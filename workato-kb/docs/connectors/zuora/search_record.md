> The Search record action in the Zuora connector lets you search records by object type using dynamically generated search parameters.

# Zuora - Search record action

## Search record action

This action searches for records in Zuora. First, select the object type in Zuora after which Workato will generate the possible search parameters. Ensure that the Zuora connector is configured to the latest WSDL SOAP API version. Earlier WSDL versions may not be compatible.
