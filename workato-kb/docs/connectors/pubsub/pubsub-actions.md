> The publish message action in the Workato Event streams connector lets you publish one message at a time to a topic that other recipes can consume.

# Using the publish message action

The publish action enables you to publish messages to a specific topic in Workato. Other recipes can then pick up all messages published to that topic, using Event streams triggers.

One action publishes one message at a time. The [topic schema](/en/connectors/pubsub/pubsub-schema-config) defines the action input fields available here.
