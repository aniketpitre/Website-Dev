# Workato Event Streams - Batch publish message action

The batch publish action enables you to publish a batch of messages to a specific topic in Workato. Other recipes can then pick up all messages published to that topic, using Event streams triggers.

One action can publish up to 100 messages at a time. The [topic schema](/en/connectors/pubsub/pubsub-schema-config) defines the action input fields available here.

Note that you need to use a list of messages as a datapill.
