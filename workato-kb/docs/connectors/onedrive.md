# OneDrive

[OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage) is a cloud storage and file hosting service by Microsoft, fully integrated with Microsoft Office. Workato's OneDrive connector enables you to seamlessly integrate and automate workflows between OneDrive and third-party applications, supporting a wide range of file processing use cases.

> **FEATURE AVAILABILITY**
> 
> The OneDrive connector isn't available to workspaces in the CN data center. This reflects local regulatory requirements and applies to our multi-tenant and [Virtual Private Workato (VPW)](/en/cloud-hosting-editions/hosting-editions#virtual-private-workato) offerings.

## API version

The OneDrive connector uses the [Microsoft Graph API v1.0 for OneDrive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/onedrive?view=graph-rest-1.0).

## Connection setup

The OneDrive connector supports the following authentication types:

- [Authorization code grant authentication (OAuth 2.0)](#authentication-auth-code)
- [Client credentials-based authentication (OAuth 2.0)](#authentication-client-credentials)

> **MICROSOFT MFA ENFORCEMENT**
> 
> Microsoft is rolling out mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA) gradually to different applications and accounts in phases. This enforcement continues throughout 2025 and beyond. Refer to the Microsoft [Mandatory multifactor authentication for Azure and admin portals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication?tabs=dotnet) documentation for more information.
> 
> We strongly recommend enabling MFA now for all Microsoft accounts used with Workato to avoid service disruptions from short-notice enforcement changes.
> 
> Complete the following steps to maintain uninterrupted service:
> 
> 1. Enable MFA for your Microsoft organization following the Microsoft MFA setup guide. Refer to [Set up multifactor authentication for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide) for more information.
>    
> 2. Reconnect your Microsoft connection in Workato.
>    
> 3. Complete the OAuth flow with MFA when prompted.
>    
> 4. Test your recipes to ensure they work with the updated connection.
