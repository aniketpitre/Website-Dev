# Workato EDI - Send transaction file action

Use the **Send transaction file** action to send a file as an **Any File** transaction to a trading partner through Workato EDI. **Any File** transactions contain arbitrary file payloads that fall outside standard EDI message formats, such as XML or flat positional files with custom structure and syntax.

Refer to the Orderful [outbound **Any File** transactions](https://docs.orderful.com/docs/outbound-mft-create-and-send-any-file) documentation for more information.
