## How to use this action

The following example demonstrates how to use the **Search rows** action with the [Update row action](/en/connectors/google-sheets/action-update-row-v4).

Our sample sheet is a list of items from different countries. For the Google Sheets connector to work, your sheet must have at least one header row and one data row.

In this example, there is a mistake in cells A3 and A4: these values should be `Australia and Oceania`, not `Asia`.

To fix this, our recipe must search for rows where **Country** equals `Australia` and **Region** equals `Asia`. Then, it must update the **Region** to `Australia and Oceania` instead.
