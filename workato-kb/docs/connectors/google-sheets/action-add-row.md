> The Add row action in the Google Sheets connector lets you add a new row to a spreadsheet sheet you select.

# Google Sheets - Add row action

This action adds a new row to a Google Sheet you select.

> **LIMITATION WITH GOOGLE SHEETS ACTIONS**
> 
> Avoid including a colon (`:`) in the names of sheets you plan to use with the **Add row** action. A colon in the sheet name causes an `Unable to parse sheet` error. This is a known limitation within Google Sheets. Specifically, attempting to update multiple cells in a sheet with a colon in its name results in an error, allowing only one cell to update successfully.

In this scenario, we plan to transfer new contacts created in Salesforce to Google Sheets.

The following outlines the data mapping configuration used to direct data from Salesforce to the corresponding fields in Google Sheets:

After running the recipe, the trigger detected a new contact named Anna Sharpay created in Salesforce. We mapped `Name`, `Email`, and `Date created` in the recipe, and these values were passed to the **Add row** action.
