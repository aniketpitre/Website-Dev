# Google Sheets - New row in sheet in My Drive trigger

This trigger detects new rows added at the bottom of your selected sheet. When you start your recipe for the first time, this trigger picks up all existing rows in the sheet, excluding the header row. Subsequently, the trigger picks up new rows added to the end of the sheet.

Note that rows added in the middle of the sheet are not detected. Don't delete any row from the sheet when this trigger is active, as it can disrupt tracking.

> **LIMITATIONS**
> 
> This trigger works exclusively with My Drive. Use the [New row in sheet in Team Drive trigger](/en/connectors/google-sheets/trigger-new-row-team-drive) to monitor Team Drive.
