# Google Sheets - Update row action

This action allows you to update a row in a sheet. It is often used with the [Search rows action](/en/connectors/google-sheets/action-search-rows-v4).

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |

## Output

| Output field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Spreadsheet ID | ID of the spreadsheet. You can map this into the `Spreadsheet` input field of other Google Sheets actions instead of selecting the spreadsheet from the drop-down menu. |
| Spreadsheet name | Name of the spreadsheet. |
| Sheet name | Name of the sheet. You can map this into the `Sheet` input field of other Google Sheets actions instead of selecting the sheet from the drop-down menu. |

## How to use this action

The following example demonstrates how to use the **Update row** action with the [Search rows action](/en/connectors/google-sheets/action-search-rows-v4).

Our sample sheet is a list of items from different countries. For the Google Sheets connector to work, your sheet must have at least one header row and one data row.

In this example, there is a mistake in cells A3 and A4: these values should be `Australia and Oceania`, not `Asia`.

To fix this, our recipe must search for rows where **Country** equals `Australia` and **Region** equals `Asia`. Then, it must update the **Region** to `Australia and Oceania` instead.
