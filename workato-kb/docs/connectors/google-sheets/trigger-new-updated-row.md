## How to use this trigger

Complete the following steps to set up and use the **New/updated row in sheet in My Drive (real-time)** trigger:

### Set up the Google Sheet

To retrieve sheet data, the sheet must include at least one header row and one data row:

### Configure the trigger

1. Select the **New/updated row in sheet in My Drive (real-time)** trigger.
   
2. Select a spreadsheet in the **Spreadsheet** drop-down menu to dynamically generate the list of sheets in your spreadsheet.

3. Select the specific sheet to monitor for new or updated rows in the **Sheet** field.
   
4. Select a column to monitor for changes in the **Column to monitor** field. Every time the data in a cell in this column changes, the recipe picks up the entire row of data.
   
   Alternatively, you can select the `All columns` option, which activates the trigger whenever a row is changed.
   

### Test the trigger

After configuring the trigger, you can finalize and run the recipe.

This test aims to verify that the trigger detects new rows in the sheet. The action is not critical to this test, so you can use the **Get current time** Scheduler action.

Click **Start recipe** to run your recipe. Your recipe should resemble the following screenshot:

In this example, the trigger detects all four rows of data in the spreadsheet. You can [customize the jobs report](/en/recipes/jobs#customizing-job-reports) to display the information relevant to you:

![new job report](/assets/customized-job-report.Bx4HXjdr.png)_Customized job report displaying selected information about the trigger event processed_

The following shows the customization of the job report:

If the sheet is configured to monitor only changes to the **Date registered** column, changes to other columns (like Andy's shirt size) won't trigger the recipe.

However, if you edit Xander's **Date registered** value in cell E5, the recipe detects it as a trigger event and processes row 5 with the latest data.

![edited sheet](/assets/edited-sheet.Ci5Q3ybS.jpg)_Edited sheet. Cells in rows 3 and 5 (highlighted) have been updated with new values_

Row 5 is processed as a trigger event, as seen in the job details:

![date sheet](/assets/date-sheet.D7ysIWJ0.png)_Only row 5 will be picked up as "Date registered"- the only column we are monitoring changes for_

While the recipe is running, any new or updated rows are picked up almost immediately. If the recipe is stopped and restarted, it continues processing from where it left off. This means that any changes made while the recipe was stopped are detected and processed when the recipe starts again.

Note that only the latest version of a row is picked up. For example, if a row is created and updated multiple times while the recipe is stopped, only the most recent version triggers an event when the recipe restarts.
