# NetSuite SOAP - Add standard object and add custom object actions

The **add standard object** and **add custom object** actions are similar; we describe them here together.

## Configure the add object action

1. Select the object you plan to create.
   
   Let's create a sales order.
   
2. The recipe retrieves the fields of your selected NetSuite object.

3. Select and map the specific fields you plan to write to when creating the new NetSuite record.

4. Some NetSuite fields display their internal API names instead of their labels in NetSuite.
   
   For example, **Entity ID** refers to the customer/vendor where to attach a transaction document, while **Internal ID** refers to the NetSuite ID of any object.
   

If you can't find the field you're looking for, check with your NetSuite admin or with us!
