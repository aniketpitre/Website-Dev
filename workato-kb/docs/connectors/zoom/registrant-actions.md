> The registrant actions in the Zoom connector let you add, get, and update registrants for Zoom webinars, meetings, and cloud recordings.

# Zoom - Registrants

Registrants are a way for people to register for your webinars, meetings, and cloud recordings. Having people register for your webinars, meetings, and cloud recordings is also a great way to collect information about the registrant such as their purchase role and purchasing time frame.

The Zoom connector supports the following **registrant** actions:

- [Add registrants](#add-registrants)
- [Get registrants](#get-registrants)
- [Update registrant](#update-registrant-status)

## Add registrants

Add registrants to any webinars, meetings, or cloud recordings. This allows you to register a participant without them having them actually register. This allows you to collect registration information in a platform of your choice like EventBrite and send that data over to Zoom through Workato.
