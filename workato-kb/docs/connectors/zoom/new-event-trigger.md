# Zoom - New event trigger

The **New event** trigger monitors Zoom for new events in real-time. Workato creates a job for each new event.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Event category | Select the event category. Categories enable you to filter events by type, such as webinar or meeting events. |
| Event | Select the [event](#event-types) that activates the trigger. |

> **ORGANIZATION-LEVEL EVENT MONITORING**
> 
> Events are triggered at the organization level. For example, if this trigger monitors ended meetings, a new job is created for every meeting ended by any user in the connected Zoom organization. You can use a meeting’s or webinar’s tracking fields to [filter relevant events](/en/connectors/zoom/best-practices#filtering-trigger-events-on-zoom).
