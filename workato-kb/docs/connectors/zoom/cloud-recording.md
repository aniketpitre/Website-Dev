# Zoom - Download cloud recording action

The **Download cloud recording** action allows you to download cloud recordings directly from Zoom and send them to downstream applications. For example, you can send completed cloud recordings from Zoom to Salesforce so that sales call recordings are immediately accessible to salespeople.

## Input

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Download URL | The download URL of the file. Learn more about the different types of [Zoom recording files](/en/connectors/zoom/cloud-recording#download-urls-for-zoom-recording-files). |
| Download token | An OAuth token. We recommend using the Download token output datapill from **Cloud recording completed** in the **New event** trigger. Learn how to generate the [download token](/en/connectors/zoom/cloud-recording#retrieve-recording-files-using-a-download-token). |

## Download URLs for Zoom recording files

Each cloud-recorded meeting or webinar on Zoom includes various file types, each with its own download URL. The availability of these files depends on the features used during the meeting. For instance, no chat file is available if the chat feature was not used during the meeting.

The download URLs for these files can be found in the output of the following triggers and actions:

- **Cloud recording transcript completed** in the [New event](/en/connectors/zoom/new-event-trigger#event-types) trigger
- **Cloud recording completed** in the [New event](/en/connectors/zoom/new-event-trigger#event-types) trigger
- **Get cloud recording** in the [Get object by ID](/en/connectors/zoom/event-actions#get-event-details) action

Each of these triggers and actions generates a list of **Recording files** for the cloud recording.

## Recording file types

| File type | Description | Format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MP4` | Audio/video file of the recording. | mp4 |
| `M4A` | Audio-only file of the recording. | m4a |
| `M3U` | Playlist file to play all individual MP4 files (Windows only). | m3u |
| `TIMELINE` | Timestamp file of the recording. Enable the **Add a timestamp to the recording** setting in the recording settings to retrieve a `TIMELINE` file. The time is displayed in the host's timezone, which is set on their Zoom profile. | json |
| `CC` | File containing closed captions of the recording. | vtt |
| `CHAT` | File containing in-meeting chat messages sent during the meeting. | txt |
| `TRANSCRIPT` | Transcription file of the recording. | vtt |

## Retrieve recording files using a download token

If you use **Cloud recording completed** in the [New event](/en/connectors/zoom/new-event-trigger) trigger, the output provides a download token. This token allows you to download the cloud recording even if it is password protected, which is a recommended security default. The token expires 24 hours after the recording is completed.

The following recipe uses **Cloud recording completed** in the **New event** trigger to generate a download token, enabling you to download Zoom cloud recordings and upload them to Dropbox.

In this example, Workato processes new cloud recordings completed in Zoom. For each file in the **Recording files** list, the recipe downloads the cloud recording file using the **Download URL** and **Download token** from **Cloud recording completed** in the **New event** trigger. It then maps each file to its respective fields.

Then, the recipe sets a file extension based on the **Recording file** type.

This enables you to name each **Recording file** with the appropriate file extension and prevent issues with accessing the files.
