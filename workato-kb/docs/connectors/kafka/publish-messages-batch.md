## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Topic | Select or enter the name of the topic where you plan to publish messages. |
| Message schema source | Select where your message schema is defined. Options include: **Common data model** - Use the schema defined in Workato, **Schema registry** - Use the schema defined in your Kafka cluster. Requires the `schema.registry.url` property to be configured, **Common data model – Protobuf** - Use Protobuf schemas defined in Workato Workato supports schemas in AVRO and Protobuf format. |
| Message schema | Select the message schema based on the **Message schema source** selection. |
| Protobuf message schema | Select the Protobuf message schema from the schema registry. This field appears when **Common data model – Protobuf** is selected as the message schema source. |
| Key schema type | Configure the schema type for your message keys. Options include: **Plaintext** - Use simple string keys, **Schema registry** - Use schemas from your Kafka cluster.

| Key schema | Select the key schema from your available schemas. This field appears when **Schema registry** is selected as the key schema type. |
| Partition | Specify a topic partition (index starts from 0) to explicitly publish to. If not specified, Kafka selects the partition automatically. |
