# Marketo - Monitor leads added to list trigger (batch)

This trigger picks up leads added to a specified list in your Marketo instance. It checks for new leads once every poll interval and Workato processes each lead as a separate job.

## Input

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Trigger poll interval | Specify how frequently to check for new events. This field defaults to five minutes if left blank. The minimum value allowed is five minutes. |
| When first started, this recipe should pick up events from | When you start the recipe for the first time, it picks up leads added to the list from this specified date and time. Refer to [Triggers](/en/recipes/triggers#since-from) to learn more about this input field. |
| List | Select the list to monitor for new leads. Alternatively, switch to **Use list IDs** to enter a comma-separated list of IDs. The list ID is the first contiguous set of numbers after the `ST` in the URL. For example, if the list URL is `https://app-ab.marketo.com/#ST1001A1`, then `1001` is the list ID. |
| Enrich lead data | Select whether to enrich the lead data. If **Yes**, the trigger output performs additional requests to supplement each activity record with the associated lead data. If you plan to reduce the number of API requests, select **No** to exclude lead enrichment requests. |
| Batch size | Provide the number of records to be returned in each job. The minimum batch size is `1` and the maximum is `1000`. This field defaults to `300`. |
