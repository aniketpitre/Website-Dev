> The New Marketo Self Service Flow Step trigger picks up new self-service flow steps in real time, processing each as a separate job in Workato.

# Marketo - New Marketo Self Service Flow Step trigger (real-time)

This trigger picks up new Self-service Flow Steps in your Marketo instance. It listens for new flow steps in real-time and Workato processes each flow step as a separate job.

> **TRIGGER AND ACTION CONFIGURATION**
> 
> This trigger must be used with the [Return data to Marketo Self Service Flow Step action](/en/connectors/marketo/return-data-to-marketo-self-service-flow-step-action).
> 
> Ensure you start the recipe in Workato before completing the setup in Marketo. If you modify the trigger or action configuration, you must create a new flow step service in Marketo and deprecate the old one.
> 
> For detailed steps on configuring this trigger, action, and setting up a new service in Marketo, refer to our [Self-service Flow Steps](/en/connectors/marketo/self-service-flow-steps#steps-to-configure-self-service-flow-steps) documentation.
