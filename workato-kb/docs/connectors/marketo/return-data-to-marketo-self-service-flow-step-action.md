# Marketo - Return data to Marketo Self Service Flow Step action

This action returns data to Marketo from a Self Service Flow Step invocation.

It must be used with the [New Marketo Self Service Flow Step trigger](/en/connectors/marketo/new-marketo-self-service-flow-step-trigger). Together, these create a [Marketo Self Service Flow Step](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/flow-actions/flow-step-service). The recipe must be started in Workato before you can continue setting up the flow step in Marketo.

If any changes are made to the trigger or action configurations, a new flow step service must be created in Marketo, and the old service should be deprecated. To specify which values are returned to Marketo, you must first select the corresponding fields in the trigger configuration.
