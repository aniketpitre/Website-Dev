# Marketo - Export new leads in Marketo trigger (bulk)

This trigger runs on a schedule you set and returns new leads from Marketo.

Search results are returned as a complete CSV stream. You can write the CSV stream to a file using a file connector, such as [Box](/en/connectors/box) or [SFTP](/en/connectors/sftp), or parse it for use as a data list in Workato using the **Parse CSV** action in the [CSV by Workato utility connector](/en/features/handling-csv-files#csv-by-workato).

Processing times can vary and be delayed due to the time required for the query to be completed in Marketo. Because of this, Workato doesn't support test jobs for recipes with this trigger.

You can also use this trigger in conjunction with the [Get object schema](/en/connectors/marketo/get-objects-action) action to fetch schema information of a Marketo object and replicate it to your data warehouse. Learn more about [bulk triggers and ELT/ETL processes](/en/features/etl-elt-guide#bulk-vs-batch).
