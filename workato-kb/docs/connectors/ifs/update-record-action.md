# IFS connector - Update record action

The **Update record** action updates a record in Industrial and Financial Systems (IFS) Cloud. You can select an IFS service to work with. IFS service availability depends on your IFS instance configuration.

## Input

| Object | Select the object to update. The list of available objects is generated dynamically based on the service you select. |
| {Object} ID | Provide the ID of the object to update. You can map in the object ID from the output of the [Search records in IFS action](/en/connectors/ifs/search-records-action). |

Additional input fields are available based on the object you select. You must update at least one field for the action to complete successfully.
