# IFS connector - New/updated record trigger

The **New/updated record** trigger runs when a record of the selected object is created or updated in Industrial and Financial Systems (IFS) Cloud. Workato processes each record as a separate job. You can select an IFS service and object to work with. IFS service availability depends on your IFS instance configuration.

The required information for handling time ranges and pagination are auto-detected after you select an object. You may need to provide additional information in some situations.
