# Using the OpenAPI connector to create custom connectors

An application-specific connector gives you full flexibility and the recommended user experience. However, building a connector from scratch might take a long time. To reduce the time building a connector, use the OpenAPI connector as a basis or template for creating an application connector.

Once converted, the new application-specific connector can be used in Workato recipes in place of the universal OpenAPI connector.

**Not sure if this is the right approach for you?** In most cases, the OpenAPI connector can be used as-is. There are, however, some situations where creating a custom connector may be required. For example:

- Customizing the connector's name or icon
- Implementing a custom authentication flow
- Adding app-specific connection fields
- Simplifying connection settings

If any of the above are applicable, creating a custom connector is likely the recommended approach.

## Prerequisites

To set up an OpenAPI connection, you'll need:

- **Familiarity with the Workato Connector SDK.** Refer to the [SDK documentation](/en/developing-connectors/sdk) for more info.
  
- **Privileges in Workato that allow you to:**
  
  - Create connections
  - Create and modify SDK connectors
- **A Swagger file that**:
  
  - Conforms to the OpenAPI v2 or v3 [specification](https://swagger.io/specification/v3/)
  - Is valid JSON or YAML

* * *

## Step 1: Install the connector

The first step is to install the connector in your Workato account. If you've already done this, skip to [Step 2](#step-2-create-a-new-sdk-connector-in-workato).

1. Open [the connector in the community library](https://app.workato.com/custom_adapters/50046/details?community=true).
   
2. Click **Install connector**.
   
3. Click **Release latest version**.
   

* * *

## Step 2: Create a new SDK connector in Workato

- [Step 2.1: Copy OpenAPI connector source code](#copy-source-code)
- [Step 2.2: Create an SDK connector](#create-sdk-connector)

### Step 2.1: Copy OpenAPI connector source code

1. Sign in to your Workato account if you aren't already.
   
2. Navigate to **Tools > Connector SDK**.
   
3. Click the **OpenAPI** tile.
   
4. Select and copy the contents of the **Source code**.
   

### Step 2.2: Create an SDK connector

1. Navigate back to the **Connector SDK** page.
   
2. Click **\+ New connector**.
   
3. Replace the contents of the **Source code** with the code you copied from [Step 2.1](#copy-source-code).
   
4. Click the **pencil icon** or the connector's name and re-name the connector:
   
   ![Renaming a new SDK connector](/assets/rename-connector.Cedfovq4.gif)
   
5. If you want to replace the connector's icon:
   
   1. Hover over the default icon until **Upload** appears:
      
      ![Renaming a new SDK connector](/assets/upload-icon._noxrqb_.gif)
      
   2. Click the icon.
      
   3. Select and upload a new icon.
      
6. Click **Save** to save the connector.
   

* * *

## Step 3: Customize the connector's configuration

This step will show you how to modify the connector's connection settings. There are two ways to accomplish this:

> **TIP**
> 
> We recommend customizing the source code only when necessary to simplify version upgrades. The more customization a connector has, the more complex an upgrade can be.

- [**Add custom fields or modify default connection fields.**](#add-modify-connection-fields)
- [**Hard-code connection values.**](#hard-code-connection-values) This approach is useful for simplifying connection setup for your users. For example: Instead of asking a user to provide a link to an OpenAPI document, you can hard-code it.

Refer to the [OpenAPI default connection fields reference](/en/connectors/openapi/reference/default-connection-fields) for more info about connection fields.

### Adding and modifying connection fields

To add or modify connection fields, locate the `connection.fields` list. Workato uses this list to generate the connection user interface.

By default, Workato populates this list with fields like **OpenAPI document source**, **Document URL**, and so on. If you don't want a field to display, you can remove it from the list, or [hard-code its value](#hard-code-connection-values) so users don't have to provide it.

For example: Your application only requires an API key for authentication. You could remove all default fields and add a single `api_key` field, where the user will be prompted to provide their API key:

```ruby
connection: {
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'api_key',
      label: 'API key',
      hint: 'Refer to <a href="<YOUR_DOC_URL>"><APP> docs</a> ' \
            'for help retrieving your API key.',
      optional: false,
      control_type: 'password'
    }
  ]
}
```

> **TIP**
> 
> Refer to the [SDK Schema reference](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/schema) for more info about defining fields and their properties.

### Hard-coding connection values

To simplify connection setup for your users, you can hard-code connection values. This removes a step from setup by providing required connection values on behalf of the user.

**Except for authentication-related fields**, connection values can be hard-coded in the `adjust_connection` method. This method is invoked from other methods across the source code and affects the connector's behavior. When changes are made to this method, they're applied everywhere the method is invoked.

Use the following convention to add a field to `adjust_connection`. Replace `<FIELD_NAME>` with the `name` of the field, and `value` with its hard-coded value.

```ruby
methods: {
  adjust_connection: lambda do |connection|
    connection.merge (
      {
        '<FIELD_NAME>' => '<VALUE>',
        '<FIELD_NAME>' => '<VALUE>'
      }
    )
  end,
  [...]
}
```

For example: In the [previous section](#add-modify-connection-fields), all default connection fields were removed from `connection.fields`. These field values must be hard-coded in `adjust_connection` to successfully configure the connector.

In the example above, we removed the existing connection fields from `connection.fields`. To successfully configure the connector, we need to hard-code the fields in `adjust_connection`:

```ruby
methods: {
  adjust_connection: lambda do |connection|
    connection.merge (
      {
        'definition_mode' => 'url',
        'definition_url' => 'https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.yaml',
        'base_url' => 'https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/',
        'advanced' => {
          'test_endpoint' => '/pet/findByStatus?status=%3D%5B%22available%22%5D',
          'documentation_href' => 'https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.yaml'
        }
      }
    )
  end,
  [...]
}
```

Refer to the [OpenAPI connection field reference](/en/connectors/openapi/reference/default-connection-fields) for more info about fields, including names and descriptions.

**Note**: Required fields must be present in `connection.fields` or hard-coded in `adjust_connection`.

* * *

## Step 4: Implement authentication

If authentication fields have been customized or a custom authentication flow is required, you'll need to modify the `authorization` section of the source code.

> **NOTE**
> 
> If authentication details are provided via connection fields included in the default source code, you can skip this step.

The specific methods you'll need to modify can vary depending on your requirements and the authentication method being used. Refer to the [SDK Authorization reference](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/connection/authorization#sdk-reference-authorization) for more info.

For example: In [Step 3](#add-modify-connection-fields), we replaced the default connection fields with a single `api_key` field. In this case, the `authorization.apply` method should be updated to correctly configure the custom authorization flow.

There are two ways to handle implementation, each with its own advantages:

- **Keep the code mostly as-is and only update the connection variable.** **Note**: Keeping the original code makes applying source code upgrades easier.
  
  View an example
  
  ```ruby
  authorization: {
    type: 'custom_auth',
    apply: lambda do |connection|
      connection = connection.merge(
        {
          'auth_method' => 'header',
          'auth_headers' => "api_key: Bearer #{connection['api_key']}",
        }
      )
      auth_method = connection['auth_method']
      # don't apply any credentials when requesting the API definition
      if connection['definition_mode'] == 'url' &&
         current_url == connection['definition_url']
        auth_method = nil
      end
      case auth_method
      when 'none'
        # nothing to do
      when 'basic'
        username = connection['basic_auth_user']
        password = connection['basic_auth_password']
        encoded = "#{username}:#{password}".encode_base64
        headers(Authorization: "Basic #{encoded}")
      when 'header'
        auth_headers_input = connection['auth_headers']
        lines = auth_headers_input.split(/\n+|\r+/)
        headers_hash = {}
        lines.each do |header|
          next if header.blank?
  
          header = header.split(':', 2)
          header_name = header[0]
          header_value = header[1].strip
          headers_hash[header_name] = header_value
        end
        headers(headers_hash)
      end
    end
  },
  [...]
  ```
  
- **Replace existing code with new, custom code.** With this approach, the code is specific and easy to read. The downside, however, is that due to the customization, applying source code upgrades may be more complex.
  
  View an example
  
  ```ruby
  authorization: {
    type: 'custom_auth',
    apply: lambda do |connection|
      headers(api_key: => "api_key: Bearer #{connection['api_key']}")
    end
  },
  [...]
  ```
  

* * *

## Step 5: Configure on-prem connectivity

If you require on-prem connectivity, you can configure the connector to communicate through an [on-prem agent (OPA)](/en/on-prem/agents).

> **NOTE**
> 
> You can skip this step if on-premise connectivity isn't required.

After configuring a new OPA, locate the `secure_tunnel` key at the beginning of your SDK connector's source code:

![The secure\_tunnel key in connector source code](/assets/secure-tunnel-key.B18k8UZO.png)

When set to `true`, the **Is this app in a private network**? field in the connector's setup will be available. Users can then select the OPA to connect to.
