# OpenAPI - Execute operation action

The **Execute operation** action performs an operation using OpenAPI. The list of operations is dynamically generated based on the API endpoints found in the OpenAPI document. If an API endpoint doesn't match any Create, Get, Search, Update, or Delete actions, it is displayed in the [Execute operation action](https://restfulapi.net/).
