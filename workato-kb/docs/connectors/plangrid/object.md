# PlanGrid object triggers and actions

The PlanGrid connector in Workato provides triggers and actions that allows you to select the object you want to work with when configuring the step. The required input fields will then be dynamically generated based on the object you select.

The following triggers are supported:

- New object
- New or updated object
