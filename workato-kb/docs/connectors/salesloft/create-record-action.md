# Salesloft - Create record action

The **Create record** action enables you to create a record in Salesloft.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Object name | Select the object to be created from the drop-down menu. |

Workato dynamically populates additional fields depending on the object you select. For example, if you select the **Person to cadence** object, fields such as **Person ID**, **Cadence**, and **User ID** appear.
