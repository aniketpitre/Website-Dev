# Baserow

[Baserow](https://baserow.io) is an open-source no-code database. The Baserow connector lets you create, update, search, and delete table rows, list tables and fields, and trigger recipes when rows change.

Use the Baserow connector to:

- Create, update, search, get, or delete rows in a Baserow table.
- Batch-update up to 200 rows in one request.
- List the tables and fields in your Baserow database.
- Trigger a recipe when a row is created, updated, or deleted.

You can also use [custom actions](/en/developing-connectors/custom-actions) to build a custom HTTP request to any Baserow API endpoint. Refer to the Baserow [Database API](https://baserow.io/docs/apis/rest-api) documentation for endpoint details.
