> The Create custom object record action in the Zendesk connector creates a single custom object record in your instance.

# Zendesk - Create custom object record action

Zendesk allows you to configure custom objects to model, store, and retrieve objects that are not native to Zendesk (for example, Tickets, Users, Organization). Refer to [Zendesk custom objects](/en/connectors/zendesk/custom-objects) for more information.

This action creates a single record of a custom object in your Zendesk instance.

> **VERSION DEPRECATION**
> 
> A previous version of this action worked with Zendesk's legacy custom objects, which Zendesk removed on July 27, 2026. That version is now deprecated. It remains available in existing recipes and continues to function for legacy custom object records. New recipes use the updated version, which works with Zendesk's current Custom Objects API.
> 
> You can update an existing recipe step by selecting the **Create custom object record** action and choosing the version without the **Deprecated** tag in the **Action** tab.
