# Zendesk - Get list of custom object records by external IDs action (batch)

Zendesk allows you to configure custom objects to model, store, and retrieve objects that are not native to Zendesk (for example, Tickets, Users, Organization). Refer to [Zendesk custom objects](/en/connectors/zendesk/custom-objects) for more information.

This action retrieves a list of custom object records that matches a search by external IDs. Only results in your Zendesk instance that matches the criteria will be returned.

> **VERSION DEPRECATION**
> 
> A previous version of this action worked with Zendesk's legacy custom objects, which Zendesk removed on July 27, 2026. That version is now deprecated. It remains available in existing recipes and continues to function for legacy custom object records. New recipes use the updated version, which works with Zendesk's current Custom Objects API.
> 
> You can update an existing recipe step by selecting the **Get list of custom object records by external IDs** action and choosing the version without the **Deprecated** tag in the **Action** tab.
