# Zendesk - Get custom object record by ID action

Zendesk allows you to configure custom objects to model, store, and retrieve objects that are not native to Zendesk (for example, Tickets, Users, Organization). Refer to [Zendesk custom objects](/en/connectors/zendesk/custom-objects) for more information.

This action retrieves details about a specific custom object record that matches a search by Zendesk ID. Only records in your Zendesk instance that matches the criteria will be returned. This action fails if a record with the provided ID does not exist.

> **VERSION DEPRECATION**
> 
> A previous version of this action worked with Zendesk's legacy custom objects, which Zendesk removed on July 27, 2026. That version is now deprecated. It remains available in existing recipes and continues to function for legacy custom object records. New recipes use the updated version, which works with Zendesk's current Custom Objects API.
> 
> You can update an existing recipe step by selecting the **Get custom object record by ID** action and choosing the version without the **Deprecated** tag in the **Action** tab.
