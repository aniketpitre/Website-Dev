# Supabase - New, updated, or deleted row trigger

The **New, updated, or deleted row** trigger invokes when Supabase sends a database webhook for an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE event on a table.

> **SET UP THE WEBHOOK IN SUPABASE**
> 
> Copy the webhook URL from this trigger step after you save the recipe. Supabase doesn't have a subscription API for this webhook, so you must set it up in the Supabase dashboard or by SQL. Refer to the Supabase [Database Webhooks](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/webhooks) documentation for setup steps.
