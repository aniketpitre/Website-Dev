# SQL Server - Export query result action

This action executes a SQL query and exports the results as a CSV file.

> **ON-PREM PROFILE CONFIGURATION**
> 
> Remember to configure a staging area in your on-prem agent profile. Learn how to set up a staging area in the [OPA server profile](/en/on-prem/agents/connection/profile#server-profile).

## On-prem and Cloud connection input fields

The **Export query result** action provides an additional input field if your connection is established through on-prem rather than using a cloud-based connection. If you have an on-prem connection, the **Upload URL** field displays. This field enables you to export your CSV file to a URL you specify.
