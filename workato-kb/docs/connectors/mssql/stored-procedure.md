# SQL Server - Execute stored procedure action

## Execute stored procedure

This action lets you execute any stored procedure or functions saved in your database instance. Stored procedures are user defined processes written directly into your database. They can be written to accept input parameters and perform actions on these input parameters. Workato's `Execute stored procedure` action is able to pick up on parameter inputs and allows you to dynamically input these parameters directly from your workflow.

Using stored procedures are a great way to improve recipe efficiency and balance load between Workato and your database.

## Supported versions

This action is only supported for SQL Server 2012 or newer. It uses a default stored procedure `sp_describe_first_result_set` that is only available from SQL Server 2012 onwards.
