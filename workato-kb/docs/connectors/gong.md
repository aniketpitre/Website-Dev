> Connects Workato to Gong to build automations.

# Gong

[Gong](https://www.gong.io/) is a revenue intelligence platform that captures customer interactions across phone, web conferencing, and email. Gong understands the content of these interactions and delivers actionable insights. Use the trigger from the Gong connector to run the recipe each time an event occurs in Gong, and the actions to add calls and media, and search for call data.

## API version

The Gong connector uses the [Gong API v2](https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#overview).

## Connection setup

The Gong connector uses OAuth 2.0 authentication.

### Minimum and default scopes

Workato requires the `api:users:read` scope. Refer to the [Gong API documentation](https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#overview) for more detailed information about the available scopes.
