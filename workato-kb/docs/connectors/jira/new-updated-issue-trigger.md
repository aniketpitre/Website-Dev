# Jira - New/updated issue trigger (real-time)

The **New/updated issue (real-time)** trigger monitors Jira for new or updated issues in real-time.

> **ISSUE ACCESS**
> 
> Workato only triggers jobs from issues that the connected Jira account has access to.

## Prerequisites

This trigger requires the `administrators` global permission in Jira and an authentication type other than OAuth 2.0.

Use the **HTTP** connector's [New event via polling](/en/developing-connectors/http/building-http-trigger) trigger or the [Webhooks connector](/en/connectors/workato-webhooks) if the connected Jira account doesn't have this permission.

Refer to [How Jira real-time triggers work in Workato](/en/connectors/jira/triggers#how-jira-real-time-triggers-work-in-workato) for more information.
