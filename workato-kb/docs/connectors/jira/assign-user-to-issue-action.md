# Jira - Assign user to issue action

The **Assign user to issue** action assigns an issue to a Jira user. This action replaces existing assignees.

> **ACCOUNT ID REQUIRED**
> 
> Atlassian has deprecated the use of usernames and user keys in the Jira Cloud API. Use the account ID of the user instead of the username when you assign issues. Refer to the Atlassian [user privacy API migration guide](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/deprecation-notice-user-privacy-api-migration-guide/) for more details.
