# Jira - Triggers

The following Jira triggers can be used to kickstart workflows in your recipes.

To simplify API responses, the Jira REST API uses resource expansion, which means that the API will only return parts of a resource when explicitly requested. Workato automatically fetches and expands all parameters. Learn more about [Jira's resource expansion](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#expansion).

## How Jira real-time triggers work in Workato

When you use Jira real-time triggers in your recipes, Workato automatically registers a webhook in your Jira instance **when the recipe is started**. When the recipe is stopped, **the webhook is removed**.

Registering and removing webhooks requires Jira administrator global permissions. If your Jira connection doesn't have these permissions, use a [webhook trigger with the Webhooks connector](/en/connectors/workato-webhooks) instead.

Regardless of the state of the webhook, Workato continues to run a backup poll running every 6 hours, to pick up any events (related to the recipe trigger). Workato automatically removes any duplicates from the full list of events returned by Jira.

> **REAL-TIME TRIGGER SUPPORT FOR OAUTH 2.0**
> 
> OAuth 2.0 doesn't support real-time triggers because it is incompatible with webhooks. Refer to the [Jira connection](/en/connectors/jira) guide to configure a different authentication method if you plan to use real-time triggers.
> 
> Alternatively, you can register the [Webhooks connector](/en/connectors/workato-webhooks) in Jira to use Jira's static webhook functionality. Refer to the [Cloud Jira](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-webhooks/) or [Jira Datacenter](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/managing-webhooks-938846912.html) webhook documentation for registration steps.
