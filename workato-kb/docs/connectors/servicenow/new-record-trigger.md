## New record (real-time)

**To use this trigger, the connected user must have sufficient access control to sys\_script table. Learn how to configure [access control for real time triggers](/en/connectors/servicenow#real-time-trigger).**

| Disable polling? | Polling allows us to retrospectively pull records from a previous timestamp specified in the **When first started, this recipe should pick up events from** field.

## Input field definitions

### From

This is a user-defined time that marks the earliest time that the trigger should pick up created records. If left blank, the default time will be set to **one day** before the recipe is first started.

The **Created (sys\_created\_on)** column is used to determine the time that a record is created. Only records with **Created (sys\_created\_on)** timestamp later than the time specified in **From** will be processed by the trigger.

Make sure that the user used in the connection has [sufficient access control](/en/connectors/servicenow#roles-and-permissions-required-to-connect) to the selected table.
