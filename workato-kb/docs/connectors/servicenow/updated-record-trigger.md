## Input field definitions

### When first started, this recipe should pick up events from

This is a user-defined time that marks the earliest time that the trigger should pick up created or updated records. If left blank, the default time will be set to **one day** before the recipe is first started.

The **Updated (sys\_updated\_on)** column is used to determine the time that a record is created or updated. Only records with **Updated (sys\_updated\_on)** timestamp later than the time specified in **From** will be processed by the trigger.
