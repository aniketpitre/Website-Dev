# OpenAI - Generate images action

The generate images action feature allows you to generate high-quality images from textual descriptions using machine learning models (Dall-E). This action can be used in a variety of use cases, such as:

- **Slide deck generation:** Sales teams can use the generate images API to create high-quality product images for sales presentations and proposals. By inputting a textual description of a product, the action can generate a photorealistic image that accurately represents the product's features and benefits. This can be used to generate slide decks based on specific inputs easily.
- **Brand asset generation:** Marketing teams can use this action to obtain a series of preliminary assets for their various campaigns. Within the standard campaign workflows, you can incorporate an additional step to kickstart the campaign assets generation aspect by utilizing this action and the campaign description.

This action supports three ways to generate images:

- Create images from prompt
- Edit existing image
- Generate variations of existing images.
