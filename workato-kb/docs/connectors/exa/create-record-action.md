# Exa - Create record action

The **Create record** action creates a record in Exa. Select **Monitor** to create a recurring search that runs on a schedule and delivers results to a webhook URL.

## Input

Input fields dynamically generate based on the **Object** you select. The following are a representative set of input fields. Refer to the Exa [Create a monitor](https://exa.ai/docs/reference/monitors/create-a-monitor) documentation for more information on available input fields.

### Monitor input

| Input field | Description |

| Object | Select the object to create. **Monitor** is the only option. |
| Query (Search) | Enter the natural-language query the monitor runs. |
| Number of results (Search) | Optional. Enter the number of results to return for each run. Valid values are `1`\-`100`. Defaults to `10` if left blank. |
| Period (Trigger) | Optional. Select how often the monitor runs. Options are **1 hour**, **6 hours**, **1 day**, or **7 days**. Defaults to **1 day** if left blank. |
| URL (Webhook) | Enter the HTTPS URL to receive monitor run results. The URL can't point to localhost or private IP ranges. |
| Metadata | Optional. Enter key-value pairs that Exa echoes back in webhook deliveries. Use them to route updates to other systems, such as Slack. Each key becomes an individual output datapill. Leave blank to send no metadata. |

Leave blank to send no description when **Output schema type** is **Object**. The **Output schema description** field is only available when you select an **Output schema type**. |
| Output schema properties | Optional. Define the properties of the structured output. Each property becomes an individual datapill. Leave blank to let Exa infer the schema. The **Output schema properties** field is only available when **Output schema type** is **Object**. |
