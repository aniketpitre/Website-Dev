> The New lead trigger in the Facebook Lead Ads connector fires when a user completes a lead ad form on a selected Facebook page.

# Facebook Lead Ads - New lead trigger

The **New Lead** trigger activates when a user completes a lead ad form on Facebook, providing immediate notifications. This trigger links to a specific Facebook page. Ensure you hold admin permissions for the page if it doesn't appear in the drop-down list. By selecting a form, you gain insights into the form's questions and can display datapills in Workato that correspond to these questions. If you don't specify a form, Workato captures all submissions from the page but cannot display the related datapills.
