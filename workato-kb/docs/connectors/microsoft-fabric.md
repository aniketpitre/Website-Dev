## Connection setup

The Microsoft Fabric connector supports the following authentication types:

- [Authorization code grant authentication (OAuth 2.0)](#authentication-auth-code): Acts as the Microsoft user who authorizes the connection
- [Client credentials-based authentication (OAuth 2.0)](#authentication-client-credentials): Acts as a service principal, without a signed-in user

> **MICROSOFT MFA ENFORCEMENT**
> 
> Microsoft is rolling out mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA) gradually to different applications and accounts in phases. This enforcement continues throughout 2025 and beyond. Refer to the Microsoft [Mandatory multifactor authentication for Azure and admin portals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication?tabs=dotnet) documentation for more information.
> 
> We strongly recommend enabling MFA now for all Microsoft accounts used with Workato to avoid service disruptions from short-notice enforcement changes.
> 
> Complete the following steps to maintain uninterrupted service:
> 
> 1. Enable MFA for your Microsoft organization following the Microsoft MFA setup guide. Refer to [Set up multifactor authentication for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide) for more information.
>    
> 2. Reconnect your Microsoft connection in Workato.
>    
> 3. Complete the OAuth flow with MFA when prompted.
>    
> 4. Test your recipes to ensure they work with the updated connection.
>    

### Authorization code grant authentication (OAuth 2.0)

Use authorization code grant authentication for delegated user access. The connection inherits the Fabric permissions of the Microsoft user who authorizes it.

#### Minimum and default scopes

The Microsoft Fabric connector requests the following scopes automatically. You don't need to assign these scopes in the Azure portal.

- `Tenant.ReadWrite.All`
- `Lakehouse.ReadWrite.All`
- `Lakehouse.Execute.All`
- `Workspace.ReadWrite.All`
- `DataPipeline.ReadWrite.All`
- `Item.Execute.All`
- `Item.Read.All`

Use the **Scopes** field to request additional scopes for custom actions. Enter the scopes as a comma-separated list, for example `Capacity.Read.All, Pipeline.Read.All`. The connector adds the default scopes for you.

### Client credentials-based authentication (OAuth 2.0)

This authentication type requires the following values:

- Client ID
- Client secret
- Tenant ID

> **ENABLE SERVICE PRINCIPAL ACCESS**
> 
> A Fabric administrator must enable **Service principals can use Fabric APIs** in **Admin portal > Tenant settings > Developer settings**. Microsoft enables this setting by default for new tenants. Refer to the Microsoft [Developer admin settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/admin/service-admin-portal-developer) documentation for more information.

View grant the service principal access to your workspaces steps

A service principal can only access the workspaces you add it to. Add the service principal to each Fabric workspace your recipes use and assign a workspace role that covers the operations you need.

> **DON'T ASSIGN API PERMISSIONS**
> 
> Don't add Power BI Service permissions to the app registration. Microsoft recommends against it for service principals because the permissions go unused and can cause errors that are hard to troubleshoot. Refer to the Microsoft [Automate Premium workspace and semantic model tasks with service principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/enterprise/powerbi/service-premium-service-principal) documentation for more information.
