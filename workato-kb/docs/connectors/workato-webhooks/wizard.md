> Use the Webhooks wizard in Workato to test and configure a webhook trigger, generate a unique webhook address, and listen for a sample event.

# Webhooks - Create a webhook with the wizard

The webhooks wizard enables you to test and configure a webhook trigger for your recipe. The guided setup takes you through:

- Setting up your unique webhook address
- Listening to a sample webhook event

When an event is received, the wizard automatically configures the trigger based on that event.

> **MANUAL TRIGGER CONFIGURATION**
> 
> You can exit the setup wizard at any point to configure the trigger manually.

Complete the following steps to create a webhook trigger using the setup wizard:

1. Create a new recipe by choosing the **Trigger from a webhook** option from the list of recipe starting points.
   
   ![Setup webhook](/assets/Select-Webhooks-connector.AGNiGj-v.png)_Setup webhook_
   
   This creates a new recipe with the **New event via HTTP webhook** trigger.
   
2. Click **Start guided setup** to start the wizard.
   
   ![Start setup wizard](/assets/begin-setup.Cjg7i3U4.png)_Start setup wizard_
   
3. Provide a meaningful name in the **Event name** field. This name is used to generate a unique webhook address.
   
   > **WARNING**
   > 
   > To prevent your recipe from receiving webhook events from multiple sources, the event name must be unique across all your webhook recipes.

4. Click **Next** to start listening for webhook events from your app.
   
5. Click **Copy** to retrieve the unique webhook address. You'll use this URL to register the webhook in your app.

   For example, you can register this URL as the **Payload URL** when creating a webhook in Eventbrite:
   
   ![Add a webhook in Eventbrite to send data to the webhook trigger](/assets/register-webhook-url.C34QFPeD.png)_Add a webhook in Eventbrite to send data to the webhook trigger_
   
6. Inspect the webhook headers and payload to ensure that the event was received correctly. This sample webhook event serves as the template for all future events. Workato uses the payload and header data to configure the other parts of the trigger.
   
   Alternatively, you can click **Skip guided setup** to configure the trigger manually.
   
7. Click **Setup webhook** to complete the setup.
   
   ![Webhook event received](/assets/webhook-event-received.BDslM3Vw.png)_Webhook event received_
   

The webhook is now configured. You can continue building the rest of the recipe.
