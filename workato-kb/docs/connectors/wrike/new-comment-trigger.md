# Wrike - New comment trigger

This trigger picks up comments that are created.

Each comment is processed as a separate job. It checks for new jobs once every poll interval, retrieving up to 7 days of new comments for each poll.

If the last new comment event is older than 7 days, more than 1 poll will be required to retrieve new comments up to current date & time.
