# Wrike - Search projects action

Projects are one of the main ways to organize, manage, and report on work within Wrike. In essence, Wrike projects are folders with additional properties.

This action retrieves a list of projects that matches your search criteria. Only records in your Wrike instance that match all the criteria will be returned. A maximum of 100 projects can be retrieved per job.
