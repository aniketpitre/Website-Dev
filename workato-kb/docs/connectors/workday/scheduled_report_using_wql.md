# Workday - Scheduled report using WQL trigger

## What is WQL?

Workday Query Language (WQL) is a SQL-like query language offering higher-performing Workday data querying capabilities. Since WQL is SQL-like, you may construct the query manually within Workday, or convert an existing report to WQL using the "Convert report to WQL" option.

## WQL vs. RaaS

Both Workday Report-as-a-Service (RaaS) and WQL support retrieval of large volumes of information. However, unlike Workday RaaS which returns the result one-shot, WQL supports pagination. This provides both data retrieval flexibility and performance improvements.

## Inputs

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Report WQL _required_ | Provide WQL of the report from the Convert Report to WQL action in Workday. Otherwise, construct the WQL manually in Workday. |
| Count | Set the count of the objects to be retrieved in a single batch/page, up to 1000. Minimum is 200. If left blank, defaults to 200. |
| Report columns | Override the default report schema with your own custom report schema. |

## Outputs

The output of this action is presented as an array. Each element in this array corresponds to a row in the report. Similarly, each column in your report will be rendered as a field in the report output array.

If you configured a custom schema in **Report columns**, the custom report columns will be reflected as datapills.
