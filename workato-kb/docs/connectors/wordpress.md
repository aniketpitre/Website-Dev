> Connect WordPress to Workato to automate content management for blogs, websites, and more.

# WordPress

[WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) is an open-source web content management system with tools and plugins to help you manage your website. WordPress provides a customizable platform for publishing blogs, traditional websites, mailing lists, forums, media galleries, online stores, and more.

## API version

The WordPress connector uses the WordPress REST API. Refer to the [WordPress API documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) for more information.

1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `WordPress` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.

4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Use the **Deployment type** drop-down menu to select one of the following deployment types:
   
   - **WordPress.com**: Hosted sites authenticated with OAuth 2.0.
   - **Self-hosted WordPress**: Sites running WordPress 5.6+ with application passwords enabled.
   - **Legacy (deprecated)**: Only select this option to keep an existing recipe on the legacy v1 API. New integrations should use **WordPress.com** instead.
6. Optional. Use the **Timezone** drop-down menu to select the timezone of the WordPress site. Workato uses the timezone to interpret date-time values returned by the API and to format date-time inputs when sending requests. Defaults to **UTC**.
   
7. Complete the following steps if your **Deployment type** is **Self-hosted WordPress**:
   
   Self-hosted WordPress steps
   
   1. Enter the full URL of your WordPress site, including the scheme, in the **Site URL** field. For example, `https://example.com`. We strongly recommend https because application passwords transmit credentials with basic auth.
      
   2. Enter the username to authenticate with in the **Username** field. Ensure the authentication user has at least an Editor or Administrator role.
      
   3. Enter the password for the WordPress authentication user in the **Application password** field. Refer to the WordPress [Creating an Application Password in wp-admin](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/security/application-passwords/#creating-an-application-password-in-wp-admin) guide to create this value.
      
   
8. Optional. Use the **Custom OAuth profile** drop-down menu to select a custom OAuth profile to use for the connection.
   
9. Click **Connect**, then click **Approve** to grant Workato access if prompted.
