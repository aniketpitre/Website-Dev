> Mapper is a utility connector that lets you map data to a predefined schema before publishing or moving it between applications.

# Mapper by Workato

The Mapper connector is a way for users to interact with schemas defined in the [common data model](/en/features/common-data-model) or in a [transformation map](/en/features/transformation-maps).

The Mapper connector's **Map to object** action is typically used as a temporary step to store data in a predefined structure before publishing the data somewhere for a subscriber to consume, or before moving the data to another application. It would typically be used with the [JMS connector](/en/connectors/jms) or [Workato Event streams](/en/connectors/pubsub).

## How to connect to the Mapper connector on Workato

There is no connection required to use the Mapper connector, as schemas are stored in the Workato account for recipes to interact with.

## Working with the Mapper connector

In order to work with the JMS connector, users have to have a [common data model](/en/features/common-data-model) to work with.

### Using the map to object action

Use the **Map using** drop-down menu to select a schema source:

- **Common data model > Object schema**: Select a [common data model](/en/features/common-data-model) object schema. This is the only option if the **Map using** field isn't visible in your workspace.
- **Transformation map > Transformation map**: Select a saved [transformation map](/en/features/transformation-maps).

> **FEATURE AVAILABILITY**
> 
> Transformation maps are currently available to select customers. Contact your Customer Success Representative to confirm whether they are available in your workspace.

Additional input fields generate based on your selected schema. Use these fields to populate the schema with data.
