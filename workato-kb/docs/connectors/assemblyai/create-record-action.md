# AssemblyAI - Create record action

The **Create record** action submits an audio file to AssemblyAI for transcription and returns immediately, before the transcript finishes processing.

> **ASYNCHRONOUS SUBMIT**
> 
> This action doesn't wait for the transcript to complete before processing. Content fields such as **Text** and **Words** return empty until the job finishes. Chain a [Get record](/en/connectors/assemblyai/get-record-action) step, or set a **Webhook URL** and use the [Completed transcript](/en/connectors/assemblyai/completed-transcript-trigger) trigger, to retrieve the finished transcript.
> 
> Use the [Transcribe and wait](/en/connectors/assemblyai/transcribe-and-wait-action) action to create a record and wait for the transcript to finish processing in a single step instead.
