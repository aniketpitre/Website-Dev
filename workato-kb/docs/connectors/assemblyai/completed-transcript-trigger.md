# AssemblyAI - Completed transcript trigger

The **Completed transcript** trigger invokes when a transcript's status reaches **completed** in AssemblyAI.

> **STATIC WEBHOOK, NO SUBSCRIPTION API**
> 
> This trigger uses a static webhook URL. Copy the webhook URL from the trigger step after you save the recipe. Set it as the **Webhook URL** field on the [Create record](/en/connectors/assemblyai/create-record-action) or [Transcribe and wait](/en/connectors/assemblyai/transcribe-and-wait-action) action when you submit a transcript. AssemblyAI doesn't have a subscription API for this webhook.

> **NO TRANSCRIPT TEXT IN THE PAYLOAD**
> 
> AssemblyAI's webhook payload includes only the transcript ID and status, not the transcript text. Chain a [Get record](/en/connectors/assemblyai/get-record-action) action step using the trigger's **Transcript ID** output to fetch the full transcript.
