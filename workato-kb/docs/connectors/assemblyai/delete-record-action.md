# AssemblyAI - Delete record action

The **Delete record** action permanently redacts a record's content, such as a transcript, in AssemblyAI.

> **CONTENT IS REDACTED, NOT REMOVED**
> 
> AssemblyAI doesn't remove the transcript record. It redacts the content instead. For example, **Text** becomes `Deleted by user.`, **Audio URL** becomes `http://deleted_by_user`, and **Status** stays `completed`.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Object | Select the object, such as **Transcript**. |
