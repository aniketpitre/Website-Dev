# AssemblyAI - Upload audio file action

The **Upload audio file** action uploads raw audio bytes to AssemblyAI and returns a URL you can use as the audio source when you create a transcript.

> **SEND RAW BYTES, NOT JSON**
> 
> Map a file content datapill so the request body is raw audio bytes (`application/octet-stream`). Sending JSON instead returns a URL that fails when you try to transcribe it.
