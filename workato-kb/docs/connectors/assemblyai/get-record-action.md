# AssemblyAI - Get record action

The **Get record** action retrieves a record, such as a transcript, by ID from AssemblyAI.

> **FETCH THE FINISHED TRANSCRIPT**
> 
> Use this action after the [Create record](/en/connectors/assemblyai/create-record-action) action or the [Completed transcript](/en/connectors/assemblyai/completed-transcript-trigger) trigger to retrieve the full transcript text and metadata. This is necessary because the **Create record** action and the **Completed transcript** trigger don't return the finished content directly.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Object | Select the object, such as **Transcript**. |
| Transcript ID | Enter the transcript's UUID. Use the **ID** output from the [Create record](/en/connectors/assemblyai/create-record-action) or the [Transcribe and wait](/en/connectors/assemblyai/transcribe-and-wait-action) actions, or the **Transcript ID** output from the [Completed transcript](/en/connectors/assemblyai/completed-transcript-trigger) trigger. |
