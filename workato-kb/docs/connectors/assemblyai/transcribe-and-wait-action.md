# AssemblyAI - Transcribe and wait action

The **Transcribe and wait** action submits an audio file to AssemblyAI for transcription, then polls every 60 seconds until the transcript's status reaches **completed**, and returns the finished transcript.

> **SYNCHRONOUS SUBMIT, BOUNDED WAIT**
> 
> This action polls for a maximum of 60 minutes and this setting is configurable in the **Max poll minutes** field, which is 60 by default. Use the [Create record](/en/connectors/assemblyai/create-record-action) action with a **Webhook URL** and the [Completed transcript](/en/connectors/assemblyai/completed-transcript-trigger) trigger for longer running jobs.
