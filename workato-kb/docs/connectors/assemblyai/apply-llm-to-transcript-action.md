> Run an LLM Gateway chat completion over a transcript's text, or a free-form prompt, in AssemblyAI.

# AssemblyAI - Apply LLM to transcript action

The **Apply LLM to transcript** action calls AssemblyAI's LLM Gateway to run a chat completion, optionally injecting a transcript's text into the prompt. Use this action for summaries, action items, or other free-form LLM tasks over a transcript.

> **INJECT THE TRANSCRIPT WITH A PLACEHOLDER**
> 
> Enter a **Transcript ID** and include the literal tag `{{ transcript }}` (exact spacing) in **Prompt** or **Messages**. AssemblyAI replaces the tag with the transcript's text before sending the request to the model.
