# AI by Workato - Translate text action

The translate text action empowers you to automatically translate text from one language to another, enabling efficient communication across language barriers. With this action, you can automate the translation process and easily incorporate multilingual capabilities into your workflows.

Users can easily translate support tickets or inquiries from different languages into a common language, and generate localized content for websites and documents. It can also help with changing marketing assets across languages with ease.
