# AI by Workato - Analyze text action

Use the **Analyze text** action to understand specific information from a given piece of text. This action facilitates knowledge retrieval tasks and prioritizes the importance of the provided input. The action outputs an empty datapill if there is no answer found in the text.

Some common use cases include content summarization and sentiment analysis. A user can generate action items from a meeting transcript, title and hints for documents, and even descriptions for technical briefs.

The **Analyze text** action may return an `Unable to analyse the document provided` error when your input instructions contain certain words or phrases, even in legitimate business contexts. For example:

- `Outline the plan for cutting costs`
- `Summarize steps to kill a program running on a port`
- Other sensitive words or profanity

Rephrase your instructions to avoid sensitive words. For example:

- Use `stop process` or `terminate program` instead of `kill program`
- Use `reducing costs` or `optimizing costs` instead of `cutting costs`
