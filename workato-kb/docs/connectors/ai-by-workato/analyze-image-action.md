# AI by Workato - Analyze image action

The **Analyze image** action analyzes an image or PDF to answer a question you provide. For example, you can pull the vendor name and total from a scanned invoice. The output datapill value is `null` if the action doesn't find an answer in the file.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| File contents | Map the file datapill that contains the image or PDF you plan to analyze. Files can be up to 20 MB, and PDFs can have up to 15 pages. Alternatively, you can switch this field to [formula mode](/en/formulas/formula-mode) and enter a base64-encoded string using `.decode_base64`. For example, `"BASE64_TEXT".decode_base64`. Entering base64 text without decoding it may return a `Server has returned an internal error` message. |
| File name | Enter the file name with its extension, such as `invoice.png`, so Workato can infer the file type. Specify the type in **File type** if you leave this field blank. |
| File type | Select the file type of the contents: `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `webp`, `gif`, or `pdf`. This overrides the type inferred from **File name**. |
| Instruction | Provide instructions on how to analyze the file, such as an analysis technique or a question to answer. |
