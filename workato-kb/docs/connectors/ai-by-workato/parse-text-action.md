# AI by Workato - Parse text action

The parse text action enables you to extract structured data from unstructured text without requiring any coding skills. It allows you to identify and extract specific information from text documents, emails, or other textual sources. This information can include names, addresses, dates, product details, and more.

You can use this action as part of your lead generation workflows to extract customer information from incoming text messages, chat conversations, or social media posts to capture and categorize leads.
