> The Categorize text action in the AI by Workato connector lets you classify or sort text into predefined categories for routing, tagging, and filtering.

# AI by Workato - Categorize text action

The categorize text action enables you to classify or organize text data based on predefined categories automatically. For common categories, you can omit the rules, but in general, we recommend configuring a clear rule description to aid with classification.

This action allows you to efficiently sort, group, or route incoming text information to streamline your business processes. Some possible workflows it can augment are customer support ticket routing, content tagging, spam filtering, and product classification.
