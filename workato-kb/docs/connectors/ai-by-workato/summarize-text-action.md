# AI by Workato - Summarize text action

The summarize text action allows you to summarize long textual information easily. This action enables you to obtain summaries from any source and define the length of the output summary.

This action is versatile and can be used to augment multiple workflows across various departments within an organization. For example, you can use this action in sales workflows to summarize call transcripts and long email threads. Customer support teams can also use this action to quickly summarize long support tickets or product release notes into concise bullet points.
