# Docusign - Create template action

The **Create template** action creates a new template in your Docusign account.

Refer to the Docusign [Templates:create](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/templates/templates/create/) documentation for more information.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |

| Description | Enter a description of the template. |

| Documents | Add the documents to include in the template. Each document is base64-encoded and sent in a single request.
