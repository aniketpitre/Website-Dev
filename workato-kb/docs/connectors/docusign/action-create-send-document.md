> The Create/send document action in the Docusign connector lets you create and send a document for signing, with signers, routing, and signature tabs.

# Docusign - Create/send document action

The **Create/send document** action creates and sends a document for signing in Docusign.

You can send documents to multiple signers with configurable routing order, add signature and date fields (tabs), and position tabs using either anchor text or absolute X/Y coordinates. Refer to the Docusign [Tab concepts](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/tabs/) documentation for more information.

> **FILE URL**
> 
> Ensure the File URL is in a downloadable format when you configure this action. For example, if you're linking to a Google Drive document, you must follow `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=FILE_ID` and replace `FILE_ID`.
