> The New document received trigger in the Docusign connector fires when a new document arrives in a single mailbox for the authenticated user.

# Docusign - New document received trigger

The **New document received** trigger is similar to the [New recipient event](/en/connectors/docusign/trigger-new-recipient-event) trigger except that it's scoped to a single mailbox for the authenticated user in Docusign. This trigger is useful in scenarios where you want to focus on a specific mailbox.
