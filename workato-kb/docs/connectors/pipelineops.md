## Supported triggers

The following trigger is supported for this connector:

- [Sync completed trigger](/en/connectors/pipelineops/sync-completed): Runs after each sync completes in the selected data pipeline. You can configure it to trigger on every sync completion or failed syncs.

Workato recommends using **Every sync completion** to ensure your workflows detect all failure scenarios.

## Example use cases

You can use this connector to respond to pipeline sync results in real time. For example, you might send email or chat alerts when any object fails during a sync, log sync statuses to a monitoring dashboard, or trigger corrective automations when issues occur.

Refer to the [Monitor data pipelines using recipes](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/pipeline-triggers) guide for a step-by-step example.
