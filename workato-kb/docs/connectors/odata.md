> The OData connector lets you automate workflows with any OData API: create, update, delete, search, and get records, and trigger on new or updated records.

# OData

The OData connector is a universal connector you can use with any application that describes its API endpoints using OData. This connector parses a user-provided OData document and uses the content to generate a user interface, including actions, input and output fields, and objects in Workato. Use this connector when no app-specific connector is available and the application exposes an OData document.

## API version

The connector uses the following APIs:

- [OData v4 API](https://www.odata.org/odata-services/)
- [OData v2 API](https://www.odata.org/odata-services/): Select the `OData v2` tab.
