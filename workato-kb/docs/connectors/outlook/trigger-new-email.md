# Outlook - New email trigger (real-time)

The new email trigger in Outlook monitors an inbox or a shared inbox for new incoming emails. It is a real-time trigger, meaning that new emails received in the inbox will trigger the recipe and create a trigger event instantly.

By default, the trigger monitors emails sent to the connected Outlook account. However, you can choose to monitor emails in a shared mailbox by providing the email address of that shared mailbox.

If the connected user has no permissions to access the shared mailbox, or if an incorrect shared mailbox email address is entered, a `404` error occurs.

## Trigger behavior when recipe is stopped and restarted

Even if the recipe is stopped, when it's restarted again, all emails created in the time during which the recipe was stopped will be picked up by the recipe.
