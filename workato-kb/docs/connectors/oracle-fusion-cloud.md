11. Click **Connect**.
    

### JWT token

The following steps are required to connect to Oracle Fusion Cloud using JWT token authentication:

1. [Generate a X.509 key pair](#generate-a-x-509-key-pair)
2. [Retrieve the certificate fingerprint](#retrieve-the-certificate-fingerprint)
3. [Configure token-based authentication in Oracle Fusion Cloud](#configure-token-based-authentication-in-oracle-fusion-cloud)
4. [Complete setup in Workato](#complete-setup-in-workato)

You can also refer to the Oracle [Configure JWT Authentication Provider](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/fusionapps/HCM/JWT_API_Authentication_OBE/html/index.html#GenerateaX.509KeyPair) tutorial for more information about this process.

#### Generate a X.509 key pair

X.509 key pairs are used to establish secure communication by verifying the authenticity of the public certificate.

Complete the following steps to generate a X.509 key pair:

1. Open a new terminal window.
   
2. Run the following command to generate a private key:
   
   ```shell
   openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048
   ```
   
   This command creates a 2048-bit RSA private key and saves it to `private.key`.
   
3. Run the following command to generate an X.509 certificate containing the public key:
   
   ```shell
   openssl req -new -x509 -key private.key -out publickey.cer -days 365
   ```
   
   This command generates a self-signed X.509 certificate (`publickey.cer`) valid for 365 days.
   
4. Open the `private.key` file in a text editor and copy the contents, starting from `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and ending with `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.
   
   Store this key securely, as it is required to [complete setup in Workato](#complete-setup-in-workato).
   

#### Retrieve the certificate fingerprint

The certificate fingerprint is a unique identifier used to verify the authenticity of a certificate.

Complete the following steps to retrieve the certificate fingerprint:

1. Run the following `openssl` command to generate the x5t value from the `publickey.cer` file:
   
   ```shell
   openssl x509 -sha1 -in publickey.cer -noout -fingerprint
   ```
   
   The fingerprint output is in hexadecimal format:
   
   ```plaintext
   Fingerprint=00:6D:6F:4A:5F:36:71:10:24:F8:F0:FD:33:89:6D:C5:EB:92:00:0F
   ```
   
2. Convert the fingerprint to base64 format. Replace the string with your actual certificate fingerprint:
   
   ```shell
   echo "00:6D:6F:4A:5F:36:71:10:24:F8:F0:FD:33:89:6D:C5:EB:92:00:0F" | xxd -r -p | base64
   ```
   
   The fingerprint output is in base64 format:
   
   ```plaintext
   AG1vSl82cRAk+PD9M4ltxeuSAA8=
   ```
   
3. Copy the base64-encoded certificate fingerprint and store it securely. This value is required to [complete setup in Workato](#complete-setup-in-workato).
   
   > **REMOVE TRAILING CHARACTERS OR SYMBOLS**
   > 
   > Remove any trailing `=` when you store the fingerprint.
