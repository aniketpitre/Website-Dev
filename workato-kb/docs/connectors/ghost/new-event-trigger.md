# Ghost - New event trigger

The **New event** trigger monitors Ghost for the webhook event you select. Starting the recipe registers a webhook in Ghost, and stopping the recipe removes it.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Event | Select the Ghost webhook event to listen for. You can select `Post published`, `Published post edited`, `Post unpublished`, `Post scheduled`, `Member added`, or `Member edited`. Defaults to `Post published` if left blank. |

## Output

Output fields dynamically generate based on the event you select: post fields for post events, member fields for member events. Refer to the [Ghost Admin API](https://docs.ghost.org/admin-api) documentation for more information on available output fields.
