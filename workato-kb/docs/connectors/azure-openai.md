# Azure OpenAI

[Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service) is a collaboration between Microsoft Azure and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), an artificial intelligence research organization. Azure OpenAI is a cloud-based platform that enables users to build and deploy AI models. These models allow you to edit text, generate images, and perform classification. You can fine-tune and create models that are exposed internally using Azure OpenAI.

## API version

The Azure OpenAI connector uses the [Azure OpenAI Service REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference).

## How to connect to Azure OpenAI

Workato supports the following types of connections to Azure OpenAI:

- [OAuth 2.0 authentication](#oauth2)
- [API key authentication](#api-key-authentication)

> **MICROSOFT MFA ENFORCEMENT**
> 
> Microsoft is rolling out mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA) gradually to different applications and accounts in phases. This enforcement continues throughout 2025 and beyond. Refer to the Microsoft [Mandatory multifactor authentication for Azure and admin portals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication?tabs=dotnet) documentation for more information.
> 
> We strongly recommend enabling MFA now for all Microsoft accounts used with Workato to avoid service disruptions from short-notice enforcement changes.
> 
> Complete the following steps to maintain uninterrupted service:
> 
> 1. Enable MFA for your Microsoft organization following the Microsoft MFA setup guide. Refer to [Set up multifactor authentication for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide) for more information.
>    
> 2. Reconnect your Microsoft connection in Workato.
>    
> 3. Complete the OAuth flow with MFA when prompted.
>    
> 4. Test your recipes to ensure they work with the updated connection.
