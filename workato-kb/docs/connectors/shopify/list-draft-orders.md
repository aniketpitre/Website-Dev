# Shopify - List draft orders action

This action retrieves a list of draft orders on Shopify. A draft order represents the intent of ordering by a customer. It can be transitioned into an order.

Refer to the [Shopify documentation](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/2022-01/resources/draftorder) for more information on the draft order resource.
