# Microsoft OneLake - Download file action

The **Download file** action downloads the contents of an existing file from Microsoft OneLake storage. Subsequent recipe steps can use the file contents to upload the file into another app.

There is no fixed limit on file size. The maximum file size depends on whether the download can finish within the [job timeout limit](/en/recipes/jobs#timeouts).
