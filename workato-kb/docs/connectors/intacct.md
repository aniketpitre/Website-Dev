## How to connect to Sage Intacct on Workato

To establish the Sage Intacct integration workflow on Workato, you have to establish a connection between Workato and your Intacct instance.

This is a 2-step process.

1. Configure the [Intacct Web Services](#intacct-web-services) to accept Workato requests.
2. Complete the [Connection setup](#connection-setup) on Workato.

## Intacct Web Services

Configuring Intacct Web Services requires the following steps:

- Ensure that your Intacct account is subscribed to **Web Services**. To add this to your list of subscription products, please contact your manager at Intacct. You should be provided the associated credentials for a XML Gateway/ API Access User.
- Next, set up a **Web Services User** in your Intacct instance for the integration access. Refer to [Set up Web Services User on Intacct](#setup-web-services-user-on-intacct) for more information.
- Lastly, authorize Workato to access Intacct **Web Services**. Refer to [Authorize Workato on Intacct Web Services](#authorize-workato-on-intacct-web-services) for more information.

### Set up Integration System User for Workato

Workato recommends that you set up an Integration System User (ISU) on Intacct. This allows you to log all Workato integration and workflow processes on one dedicated ISU account. Furthermore, this allows you to exercise control over security policies for this integration system.

The ISU should have all the permissions needed to perform the required actions for your integration scenario. Otherwise, you may encounter `Error: 403` during recipe building.

For security reasons, each ISU should be restricted to a single integration system (like Workato).

## Setup Web Services User on Intacct

### 1\. Add Web Services User

Go to **Company** > **Admin** tab > **Web Services Users**.

![Find Web Services Users page](/assets/find-web-service-user.BrbhgVSD.png)_Find Web Services Users page_

## Authorize Workato on Intacct Web Services

According to the Intacct workflow, creating a WSU does not grant Workato access to the web service itself. It requires an additional **sender ID** credential which is required to send requests to the web service endpoint.

> **OBTAIN A SENDER ID**
> 
> You can obtain a sender ID by contacting your Sage Intacct account representative.

Find **Company** > **Setup** tab > **Company**

![Locate Company Information](/assets/view-company-information.yW3JWYPJ.png)_Locate Company Information_

Select **Edit**, look under the **Setup** tab for **Web Services authorizations**.

![Locate Web Services authorizations](/assets/view-web-services-authorizations.DNb-Dl9z.png)_Locate Web Services authorizations_

Click **Add** and configure the Web Services authorization according to the example below:

![Adding Web Services authorization](/assets/add-web-services-authorization.BgLv5jt_.png)_Adding Web Services authorization_

| User field | Recommended input | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sender ID | `Workato` | Sender IDs are case sensitive. |
| Description | \- | Describe the purpose of the authorization. |
| Status | `Active` | Ensure that the status is set to `Active`, inactive sender ID's are not able to make Web Services requests. |

## Connection Setup

To complete your Sage Intacct integration workflow, you have to connect Workato recipes to your Intacct instance. You can access this connection page from the Recipe's **connection** tab, or from the main [App connections](https://www.workato.com/connections) page on Workato.

![Workato connection setup](/assets/workato-connector-setup.CmY5V848.png)_Workato connection setup_

| Input Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Connection name | Give this connection a unique name that identifies which Intacct WSU it is connected to. |
| Login username | Provide the [User ID](#_2-configure-web-services-user-information) of the WSU. |
| Login password | The login secret for your Intacct instance. |
| Company ID | The company ID for your Intacct instance. |
