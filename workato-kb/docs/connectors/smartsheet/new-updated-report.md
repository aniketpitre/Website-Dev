# Smartsheet - New or updated row in report trigger

The **New or updated row in report** trigger activates when a row is added or changed in a Smartsheet report. This trigger fetches all existing rows in the report initially, and then captures updates to rows as they occur. It does not pick up comments or attachments when they are added or updated in a row.
