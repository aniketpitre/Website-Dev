# Smartsheet - New or updated row in a sheet trigger

The **New or updated row in a sheet** trigger activates when a row is added or updated in a Smartsheet. This trigger operates in real-time, initiating actions immediately after a row is added or modified. Events that occur when the recipe is stopped are not processed. Use the [Get row by ID](/en/connectors/smartsheet/get-row) action if you plan to monitor changes to rows when the recipe is stopped.
