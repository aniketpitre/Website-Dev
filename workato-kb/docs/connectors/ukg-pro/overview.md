# UKG Pro

[UKG Pro](https://www.ultimatesoftware.com/hcm-solutions) is an industry-leading HCM tool that helps enterprises manage the entire employee life cycle.

The UKG Pro connector allows you to **trigger off and retrieve data in UKG Pro**. Use the [UKG Pro SOAP connector](/en/connectors/ukg-pro-soap) to create or update data in UKG Pro.

## How to create an API key on UKG Pro
