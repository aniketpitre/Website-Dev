## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Folder | The folder to monitor for new files or folders. Subfolders are not monitored. Select a folder from the picklist or enter the folder ID directly. If entering the folder ID for a shared drive (formerly Team Drive), this value must be in the form `folder_id/shared_drive_id` (for example, `1fm6iCMYrN7roZZ-ynpVFRTVq9mellrWp/0AB6ZFCw3XdamUk9PAA`). IDs can be found at the end of folder and drive URLs. |
| When first started, this recipe should pick up events from | When you start recipe for the first time, it picks up new files or folders created from this specified date and time. If left blank, the recipe picks up files or folders created an hour ago. After the recipe has been run or tested, the value cannot be changed. Refer to [Triggers](/en/recipes/triggers#since-from) to learn more about this input field. |
| Chunk size (KB) | Configure this to optimize throughput. Larger chunk size increases throughput, but may hit API quotas. Defaults to 1024 KB. Refer to [File streaming](/en/features/file-streaming) for more information. |

## Output
