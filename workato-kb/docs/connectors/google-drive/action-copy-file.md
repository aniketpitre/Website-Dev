## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| File | The file you plan to copy. Select a file or enter its ID. To find the file ID, right-click the file and select **Share > Copy link**. For example, if the URL is `https://drive.google.com/file/d/123nyR2IjW_Rq84d3qEYRoq1/view`, the file ID is `123nyR2IjW_Rq84d3qEYRoq1`. Alternatively, you can find the file ID in the output of other Google Drive triggers and actions. |
| File name | The name for the newly copied file. |
| Destination folder | The folder you plan to place the newly copied file in. Select a folder or enter its ID. You can find the folder ID at the end of the folder URL. If entering the folder ID for a shared drive (formerly Team Drive), this value must be in the form `folder_id/shared_drive_id` (for example, `1fm6iCMYrN7roZZ-ynpVFRTVq9mellrWp/0AB6ZFCw3XdamUk9PAA`). By default, the copied file is placed in the same folder as the source file. |
