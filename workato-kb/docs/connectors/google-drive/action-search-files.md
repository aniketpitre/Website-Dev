## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Files or folders | Select whether to search for files or folders. |
| Folder | Narrow down the search to within this folder. Does not include matching files and folders in subfolders. Leave blank to search through My Drive. |
| Name | Search for files or folders whose names partially match the given name. |
| Modified after | Search for files modified after this date. |
| Trashed files? | Set to **Yes** to search for files that have been trashed. |
| Starred files? | Set to **Yes** to search for files that have been starred. |
| Owner email | Search for files or folders belonging to this user. |
| Writer email | Search for files or folders that this user has permissions to edit. |
| Reader email | Search for files or folders that this user has permissions to read. |
| Shared with me? | Search for files or folders shared with the connected user. |
| Query | Filter the search results by an exact query. Refer to the [Google Drive documentation](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/search-files) for the supported syntax. To filter by **Name**, **Modified after**, **Trashed files?**, **Starred files?**, **Owner email**, **Writer email**, **Reader email**, and/or **Shared with me?**, you can use the **Query** field with the [appropriate syntax](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/search-files), or you can use the preceding fields in this table, but not both. Adding any entry twice will lead to query errors. For example, if you enter the **Name** field, do not enter a `name` query. |
| Next page token | Specify the `nextPageToken` from a previous search request to retrieve the next page of search results. |
| Page size | The maximum number of files or folders to return per page. Partial or empty result pages are possible even before the end of the files list has been reached. Acceptable values are `1` to `100`, inclusive. Default is `100`. |

## Output

Note that in Google Drive API, the terms `folder` and `file` are used interchangeably. A `folder` is technically a special `file`. As a result, whenever the field name or field description mentions `file`, it also applies to `folder`.
