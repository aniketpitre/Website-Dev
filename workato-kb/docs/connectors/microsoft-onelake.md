## Connection setup

The Microsoft OneLake connector supports the following authentication types:

- [Authorization code grant authentication (OAuth 2.0)](#authentication-auth-code): Acts as the Microsoft user who authorizes the connection
- [Client credentials-based authentication (OAuth 2.0)](#authentication-client-credentials): Acts as a service principal, without a signed-in user

> **MICROSOFT MFA ENFORCEMENT**
> 
> Microsoft is rolling out mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA) gradually to different applications and accounts in phases. This enforcement continues throughout 2025 and beyond. Refer to the Microsoft [Mandatory multifactor authentication for Azure and admin portals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication?tabs=dotnet) documentation for more information.
> 
> We strongly recommend enabling MFA now for all Microsoft accounts used with Workato to avoid service disruptions from short-notice enforcement changes.
> 
> Complete the following steps to maintain uninterrupted service:
> 
> 1. Enable MFA for your Microsoft organization following the Microsoft MFA setup guide. Refer to [Set up multifactor authentication for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide) for more information.
>    
> 2. Reconnect your Microsoft connection in Workato.
>    
> 3. Complete the OAuth flow with MFA when prompted.
>    
> 4. Test your recipes to ensure they work with the updated connection.
>    

### Authorization code grant authentication (OAuth 2.0)

Use authorization code grant authentication for delegated user access. The connection inherits the OneLake permissions of the Microsoft user who authorizes it.

#### Minimum and default scopes

The connector requests the `https://storage.azure.com/user_impersonation` scope automatically. You don't need to assign API permissions in the Azure portal or request additional scopes.

#### Microsoft OneLake setup for authorization code grant authentication

Complete the following steps to set up Microsoft OneLake for authorization code grant authentication:

- [Register the Workato app in the Azure portal](#auth-code-register)
- [Generate a client secret](#auth-code-secret)
- [Obtain the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID from the Azure portal](#auth-code-ids)

### Client credentials-based authentication (OAuth 2.0)

Use client credentials-based authentication for service principal access that connects using the app identity instead of a signed-in user. This authentication type suits server-to-server automation that runs without a user present.

This authentication type requires the following values:

- Client ID
- Client secret
- Tenant ID

> **ENABLE SERVICE PRINCIPAL ACCESS**
> 
> A Fabric administrator must enable **Service principals can use Fabric APIs** in **Admin portal > Tenant settings > Developer settings**. Microsoft enables this setting by default for new tenants. Refer to the Microsoft [Developer admin settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/admin/service-admin-portal-developer) documentation for more information.

> **DON'T ASSIGN API PERMISSIONS**
> 
> Don't add Azure Storage permissions to the app registration. OneLake authorizes a service principal through Fabric workspace roles and OneLake security instead. Refer to the Microsoft [Data security in OneLake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/security/get-started-security) documentation for more information.

## Connect Microsoft Entra ID to the Microsoft OneLake connector

The Microsoft OneLake connector requests the `https://storage.azure.com/user_impersonation` delegated scope, which users can consent to themselves in most tenants. Complete this section only if your tenant restricts user consent and requires an admin to approve consent requests.

View connect Microsoft Entra ID to the Microsoft OneLake connector steps

To connect to the Microsoft OneLake connector using a Microsoft Entra ID account, ensure that all the consent requests are granted by admins.

Complete the following steps to grant admin consent using an admin account:

1. Sign in to your Azure portal and navigate to **Enterprise Applications > Activity > Admin consent requests**.
   
2. Approve the necessary consent requests.
