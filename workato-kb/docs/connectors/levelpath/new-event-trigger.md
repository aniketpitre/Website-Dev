# LevelPath - New event trigger (real-time)

The **New event** trigger monitors LevelPath in real-time for events you configure.

You must register a webhook in your LevelPath account to enable this trigger. Go to **Company Settings > Webhooks**, then add a new destination endpoint using your connector's static webhook URL. To find this URL, open the **Test code** tab in the connector SDK and go to the **Source code** section. Expand the **Static webhook URI** section to copy the webhook URL.
