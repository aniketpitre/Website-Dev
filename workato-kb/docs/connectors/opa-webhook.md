# OPA Webhook

[OPA Webhook](https://www.workato.com/) is a webhook HTTP request forwarder. OPA Webhook runs on a Workato On‑Premise Agent (OPA). This connector lets internal services send webhook events to Workato.

Example OPA Webhook workflow:

1. Workato calls the connector trigger `webhook_subscribe` when a recipe starts.
2. The connector registers the recipe’s Workato webhook URL with the OPA extension for a specified routing key.
3. Your internal service sends HTTP requests to `http://<opa-host>:<listenPort>/<routing_key>`.
4. The OPA extension forwards the request body to all running recipes with that routing key.

## Install OPA Webhook from the community library

## Connection setup

The OPA Webhook connector uses an external secrets manager for authentication.

Secure your data in the OPA Webhook connector by using an external secrets manager. Refer to [Secret management for connection credentials](/en/security/data-protection/secrets-management/secrets-management) for more information about using an external secrets manager.

### On-premise agent setup

Complete the following steps to set up OPA Webhook for external secrets manager authentication:

1. Install an on-prem agent and connect it to the workspace where you plan to use OPA webhooks. Refer to [On-prem agent](https://docs.workato.com/en/on-prem/agents) for detailed instructions.
   
2. Download the OPA Webhook extension ZIP file.
   
3. Extract the JAR file from the OPA Webhook extension ZIP file.
   
4. Save the JAR file in your OPA extension folder, such as `lib_ext/`.
   
5. Update your OPA `config.yml` to include the following:
   
   ```yml
   extensions:
     webhook:
       controllerClass: com.workato.extension.webhook.ExtensionController
       listenPort: 8081
       maxRetries: 3
       retryDelayMs: 2000
       connectionTimeout: 30000
       readTimeout: 30000
   ```
   

### Connect to OPA Webhook with external secrets manager authentication
