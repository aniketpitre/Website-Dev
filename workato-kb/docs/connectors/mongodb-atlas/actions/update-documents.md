# MongoDB Atlas - Update documents action

This action updates documents in a [MongoDB](/en/connectors/mongodb-atlas) Collection that match an optional custom query.

* * *

## Limitations

Updates to `array` fields have a few limitations:

- Updates to `array` fields will replace values entirely
  
- Partial updates (appending and/or removing fields) to `array` fields isn't currently supported.
  
  To make partial updates, we recommend that you:
  
  1. Use the [Search documents action](/en/connectors/mongodb-atlas/actions/search-documents) to obtain a copy of the field's existing values
     
  2. Manipulate the field
     
  3. Update the field using this action

| **Document schema** | Defines the schema of the documents to be updated. You can add fields manually or provide sample JSON using the **Schema generator**. **Note:** For `integer` and `decimal` data, there are a few [limitations](/connectors/mongodb-atlas/typing-fields-in-mongodb.html) to be aware of. |
| **Custom filter query** | A JSON query used to filter documents. Documents that match the query's criteria will be updated. Refer to the [Custom Filter Queries for MongoDB guide](/connectors/mongodb-atlas/guides/using-custom-filter-queries.html) for more info. |
