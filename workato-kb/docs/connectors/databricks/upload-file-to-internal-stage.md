# Databricks – Upload file to volume action

The **Upload file to volume** action uploads a file to a specified Databricks volume.

Use this action to stage large datasets in a Databricks volume before you load them into physical tables. After you upload the data, run the **Run custom SQL** action to execute SQL commands that load the staged data into Databricks tables.

## Input
