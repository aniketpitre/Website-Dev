## Input

| Input Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Table | Select the target table from the picklist, or enter the full table name. |
| WHERE condition | Define the condition to filter the rows you plan to update. All matching rows receive the same updated values. You can use simple expressions like `id = 123`, or complex expressions with subqueries. Refer to the [WHERE condition](/en/connectors/postgresql#where-condition) guide for more information. |
| Columns | Map datapills into the input fields that correspond to the table columns. |

> **CHARACTER LIMITS**
> 
> Columns in your PostgreSQL table have a character limit. The connector stores only the characters up to the defined limit if you map a value that exceeds it. It doesn't return an error. PostgreSQL returns an error when you insert the same value directly.

## Output

| Output field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Number of rows updated | The number of rows that matched the condition and were updated. |
