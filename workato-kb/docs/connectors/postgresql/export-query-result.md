# PostgreSQL - Export query result action

## Export query result

This bulk long action executes a SQL query and exports the results as a CSV file. If you are using a cloud connection, you can stream the exported CSV content via the File Contents datapill. When using a cloud connection, the maximum timeout is **120 minutes**. If you are using an OPA connection, you can upload the CSV file to a local directory or a cloud storage like an S3 bucket.

If the CSV file is uploaded to a local directory, the query results are processed and stored locally. This means that your data doesn't leave your secure network.

> Remember to configure a staging area in your on-prem agent profile. Learn how to set up a staging area in the [OPA server profile](/en/on-prem/agents/connection/profile#server-profile).
