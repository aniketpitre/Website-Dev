> Automate spend management in Ramp: manage cards, transactions, reimbursements, vendors, and more from Workato recipes.

# Ramp

[Ramp](https://ramp.com/welcome) automates finance operations so businesses spend less time and money on expenses. The Ramp connector lets you create, retrieve, update, delete, and search Ramp records directly from Workato recipes. Refer to the Ramp [REST API](https://docs.ramp.com/developer-api/v1/api/) documentation for endpoint details.

Use the Ramp connector to:

- Manage accounts, cards, and spend limits.
- Track transactions, receipts, and reimbursements.
- Manage departments, locations, and subsidiaries.
- Manage users, vendors, and merchants.

You can also use [custom actions](/en/developing-connectors/custom-actions) to build a custom HTTP request to any Ramp API endpoint.
