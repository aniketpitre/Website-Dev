> The IFS connector lets you automate ERP workflows: create, update, search, and delete records and trigger on new or updated records.

# Industrial and Financial Systems (IFS)

[Industrial and Financial Systems (IFS) Cloud](https://ifspsc2-d07.demo.ifs.cloud/landing-page/) is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform that helps organizations manage complex business processes including project management, manufacturing, supply chain, and field service operations. This connector allows you to automate business workflows, synchronize data across systems, and streamline operations so your team can focus on delivering value to customers.

## Prerequisites

You must complete the following to establish a connection to IFS in Workato:

- [Create an IAM client ID and client secret](#client-create)
- [Obtain your IFS realm](#realm-get)
- [Download the IFS connector from the Community library](#connector-download)

### Create an IAM client and client secret

Complete the following steps to create an IAM client and client secret in IFS:

1. Go to **Solution Manager > Access Control > Identity and Access Manager > IAM Clients** in the IFS sidebar.
   
2. Click **+** (plus) to create a new IAM client.
   
3. Set up your IAM Client for OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant and OAuth 2.0 client credentials authentication:
   
   Authorization code grant
   
   1. Provide a **Client ID**.
      
   2. Ensure the **Enabled** toggle is enabled.
      
   3. Enable **Direct Access Grants**.
      
   4. Enable **Service Accounts**.
      
   5. Click **+**(plus) and enter Workato's **Redirect URI**:
      
      ```
      https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback
      ```
      
   6. Click **OK**.
      
   
   Client credentials
   
   1. Provide a **Client ID**.
      
   2. Ensure the **Enabled** toggle is enabled.
      
   3. Enable **Direct Access Grants**.
      
   4. Enable **Service Accounts**.
      
   5. Click **OK**.
      
   
4. Copy the generated **Client Secret** and **Client ID** to use in your connection.

Refer to [Grant Permission Sets to Users](https://docs.ifs.com/techdocs/24r1/030_administration/010_security/020_permission_sets/070_grant_permission_sets_to_users/#grant_a_permission_set_to_multiple_users) for information on to grant permissions to service account users. This is required for client credentials authentication and not necessary for authorization code grant authentication.
   

### Obtain your IFS realm

Complete the following steps to obtain your IFS realm in IFS:

1. Go to **Solution Manager > Integration > API explorer** in the IFS sidebar.
   
2. Select any API from the list.
   
3. Select **Documentation > API Doc**.
   
4. Choose an endpoint and expand the **AUTHORIZATIONS** section.
   
5. Click the **Connect URL**.
