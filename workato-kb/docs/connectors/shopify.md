> The Shopify connector enables you to automate e-commerce workflows, managing online store orders, products, and customers across your applications.

# Shopify

[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) is an e-commerce platform that allows businesses to create online stores and sell products.

## API version

The Shopify connector uses the [Shopify REST Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest) version `2026-01` and the [Shopify GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest) version `2026-01`. You can monitor the availability of the API and other services through the Shopify Status page. Refer to [Shopify Status](https://www.shopifystatus.com/) for more information.

> **HOW DOES SHOPIFY HANDLE ITS API VERSION UPGRADES?**
> 
> Shopify generally releases a new version every three months, and maintains each release version for a maximum of twelve months. There are four stable versions supported at any point in time.
> 
> After one year, Shopify stops maintaining released versions. API calls to unsupported versions are automatically routed to the oldest currently supported stable version.
> 
> For instance, if the current available stable versions are `2025-07`, `2025-10`, `2026-01`, and `2026-04`, then any API calls requesting for `2025-04` version are automatically routed to the `2025-07` version by Shopify.
> 
> Refer to the Shopify [API versioning](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/versioning#release-schedule) documentation for more information.
