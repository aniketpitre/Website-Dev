# Snowflake - Upload file to internal stage action

Workato offers bulk loading of data to an internal stage in Snowflake. This action uses the Snowflake `[PUT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/put)` to upload files to Snowflake internal stage. This action takes in either a CSV file, or a [Workato FileStorage](/en/features/workato-filestorage#workato-filestorage) file path, and uploads it to the specified internal stage.

This action gives you the flexibility of using any type of internal stage. It is intended to work together with Workato bulk triggers (Jira, Marketo, and so on), and also works well when building [ELT/ETL recipes](/en/features/etl-elt-guide#data-orchestration-etl-elt). It also works together with the [bulk load from stage action](/en/connectors/snowflake/bulk-load-to-table-from-stage) to bring data from an external source to a Snowflake table.

| --- | --- |
| Source Type | Specify the source of your data. It can be the contents of a CSV file, referenced as a File Contents datapill, or a Workato FileStorage path. |

| Overwrite | Specify whether to overwrite an existing file in the internal stage with the same name during upload. **Defaults to `No`.** |
