> **SEND EMAIL TO MULTIPLE ADDRESSES USING A LIST DATAPILL**
> 
> Complete the following steps to send an email to multiple email addresses using a list datapill in Gmail, with the [pluck](/en/formulas/array-list-formulas#pluck) and [join](/en/formulas/array-list-formulas#join) list formulas:
> 
> 1. Set the **To** field to **Formula** mode by clicking the formula icon next to the field.
>    
> 2. Drag the list datapill containing the email addresses into the **To** field.
>    
> 3. Type `.pluck("email_address").join(",")` after the list datapill. Use the field's API name to extract the email addresses instead of the label or name displayed in the datapill.
>    
> 
> The `.pluck("email_address")` function extracts the email addresses from each item in the list, and `.join(",")` combines them into a single string separated by commas.
