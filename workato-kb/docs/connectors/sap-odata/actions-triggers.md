### Extract bulk data action

Extract bulk data action has the following limitations in comparison to search object action:

| Parameters | Search object action | Extract bulk data action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Request timeout | Up to 120 seconds | Up to 1 hour |
| Response size | Soft response size quota of up to 200 MB | Hard response size quota of 2 GB |
| Connection types | All connection types are possible | Connections that use OPA are not supported. |
| Job processing | Jobs in the queue will be processed in order | Jobs may not be processed in order |
| Authentication | Client certificate (x509) authentication is supported | Client certificate (x509) authentication is not supported |

We recommend that you use the search object action instead of extract bulk data action and paginate the records using **Limit** and **Skip token**.

### Batch request action

This action enables customers to execute multiple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a single request, significantly improving efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

1. Select the service. ![OData batch service selection](/assets/batch-select.iMTn5NVv.png)_Select service_
   
2. Click Add operation group. ![OData batch operation group selection](/assets/batch-operation-group.8a0SioKb.png)_Add operation group_
   
   > **FURTHER READING**
   > 
   > The uniqueness of the schema generated would be a combination of operation type and object selected for a particular service in the batch action.
   
3. Select operation type and object. ![OData batch operation type](/assets/batch-operation-type.BT2KYivR.png)_Select operation type_
   
   ![OData batch object](/assets/batch-object.C8fKcpto.png)_Select object_
   
4. Add more operation groups to be processed in batch by repeating steps 2 and 3.
   
5. For every operation group added, there will be an extended schema created where must add operation.

6. You can add multiple operations for the same operation group with a unique operation type and object. Also, within the operation, you can add optional fields to be used for respective use-cases. ![OData batch multiple operation](/assets/batch-multiple-operations.wd73OaQz.png)_Operations_

### Configure actions for OData V4 services

To configure the action for an OData V4 API, you need to create a separate connection using the service URL corresponding to V4 and select V4 from the OData version drop-down on the connection page.

1. For creating an action corresponding to OData v4, navigate to the service group in the drop-down. For example, if the service URL configured in the connection is `https://<S4host>/sap/opu/odata4/sap/api_bank/srvd_a2x/sap/bank/0003/`, then the service group is `api_bank`.
   
   ![OData v4 action](/assets/odata-v4-action.be3Impgl.png)_OData v4 action_
   
   > **SERVICE GROUP NAME**
   > 
   > You can confirm the service group name in the API Business Hub documentation. Visit [SAP's documentation](https://api.sap.com/api/CE_BANK_0003/overview) and locate the **Service Group Name** in the **Attributes** tab.
   
2. As recommended practice, select the latest API version which can be identified based on the serial number like `<service name>_1`, `<service name>_2`, etc. Here, `API_BANK_3` is the latest and is corresponding to the service URL `https://<S4host>/sap/opu/odata4/sap/api_bank/srvd_a2x/sap/bank/0003/`.
   
3. If it is not shown in the drop-down due to the limited items we populate in the drop-down, then enter the **Service Name** manually. For example, if the service URL is `https://<S4host>/sap/opu/odata4/sap/api_bank/srvd_a2x/sap/bank/0003/`, then service name would be `api_bank/srvd_a2x/sap/bank/0003/`.

> **ODATA V4 API LIMITATIONS**
> 
> OData v4 API returns 100 records by default for the **Search object** action and the **Extract bulk data** action. You must adjust the `Limit` parameter in the action if you require a higher number of records.

## Triggers supported

The SAP OData connector supports the following triggers:

- New object - Triggers when an object is created in SAP.
- Updated object - Triggers when an object is updated in SAP.
