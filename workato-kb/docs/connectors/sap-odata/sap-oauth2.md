> Connect SAP OData to Workato using OAuth 2.0, including Authorization Code Grant and Client Credentials Grant flows for SAP and S/4HANA Cloud.

# OAuth2.0 Authentication

Workato supports OAuth 2.0 (Open Authorization 2.0), a widely adopted protocol that enables secure, standards-based third-party access to user or system data. This protocol is commonly used to grant limited, secure access to APIs without exposing user credentials.

Workato now supports both Authorization Code Grant and Client Credentials Grant flows:

- **Authorization Code Grant** is ideal for applications where a user is present to authorize access and where the client can securely store the client secret. This flow is commonly used in interactive applications and is considered highly secure because it requires the exchange of an authorization code for an access token.
- **Client Credentials Grant** is used for server-to-server communication, where no user is involved. Instead, the client application authenticates directly using its client ID and secret to obtain an access token. This method is suitable for system integrations where background processes or services need access to protected resources.

Both of these grant types are applicable for on-premise SAP applications and SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition.

## Enable OAuth2.0

Complete the following steps to enable OAuth2.0 for OData V2 services:

> **ENABLE OAUTH2.0 FOR ODATA V4 APIS**
> 
> Please refer to the SAP Note [3304204](https://me.sap.com/notes/3304204) to create an OAuth scope for OData V4 APIs.

1. Log in to SAP system through SAP Logon and go to transaction code `/n/iwfnd/maint_service`![Service catalog transaction](/assets/service-maint.DDPDBWJe.png)
   
2. Click **Add Service**, maintain LOCAL in **System Alias** and press Enter. ![Activate and Maintain service](/assets/activate-maintain.Bh7-vmzx.png)
   
3. Select the service you plan to use and click **Add Selected Services**. This example adds `API_SALES_ORDER_SRV`, a standard SAP API. ![Add service](/assets/add-service1.ByR-gVF6.png)
   
4. Provide a custom name for the technical service, for example: `ZAPI_SALES_ORDER_SRV`.
   
5. Click **Local Object** to save the service in the local package and select the **Enable OAuth for Service** checkbox under OAuth enablement.
   
   ![oauth2 enablement](/assets/oauth2-service.D23M4qfC.png)![service catalog](/assets/service-catalog.BRmd4QUN.png)
   
6. Double-click **Alias** and validate that the **SAP System Alias** is correct for the **Service Doc. Identifier**. ![Service alias](/assets/service-alias.1vTzcqRm.png)
   
7. If the service already existed in the service catalog, then you can directly navigate to the service and click on OAuth to enable OAuth authentication. ![oauth2 enable](/assets/oauth2-enable.SJPwPWVd.png)
   

## Prerequisites for OAuth2.0

Complete the following prerequisite steps to configure OAuth:

1. Go to transaction code `SICF`. ![service browser](/assets/service-browser.B-1nl8v_.png)
   
2. Navigate to the service `authorize` under path: `default_host/sap/bc/sec/oauth2/`. ![Pick-up URL for service authorize](/assets/oauth-sicf-authorize.XNEyMW0H.png)
   
3. Right-click the `authorize` service and select **Activate Link**.
   
4. Right-click the service a second time and select **Test Link** to verify the URL for the service. The URL should be: `https://<hostname>:<port>/sap/bc/sec/oauth2/authorize?sap-client=<XXX>`
   
5. Navigate to the service `token` under path: `default_host/sap/bc/sec/oauth2/`.
   
   ![Pick-up URL for service token](/assets/oauth-sicf-token.-wgT6-Ek.png)
   
6. Right-click the `token` service and select **Activate Service**.
   
7. Right-click the service again and select **Test Service** to verify the service URL: `https://<hostname>:<port>/sap/bc/sec/oauth2/token?sap-client=<XXX>`
   
8. Go to transaction code `SU01`.
   
   > **INTEGRATION USER TO BE USED AS CLIENT ID**
   > 
   > Refer to the [SAP minimum permissions](/en/connectors/sap-odata/connection-setup#sap-permissions) section for the minimum permissions required to establish an OAuth connection.
   
   ![user creation tcode](/assets/user-create-tcode.BulWwd9u.png)
   
9. Create an integration user to whom you plan to assign OAuth scopes and ensure that `Last name` and `New Password` in the **Address** and **Logon Data** tabs are maintained.
   
   ![user creation address](/assets/user-create-int.ClkH7Fxq.png)
   
   > **PASSWORD AND USER RECOMMENDATION**
   > 
   > We recommend that you use the **Generate** option to obtain a complex string for enhanced security. This string is used as the client secret. Additionally for this user, maintain the user type as `System` user which will restrict GUI access for this user.

## Configuration for OAuth2.0 Client ID

Complete the following steps to set up the OAuth Client ID:

1. Go to transaction code `SOAUTH2`. ![soauth2 configuration](/assets/soauth-tcode.Gvjo5aKr.png)
   
2. Click **Create** and fill in the required user details and values.
   
   > **CLIENT ID USAGE RECOMMENDATION**
   > 
   > We recommend that you create multiple client IDs for individual connections to avoid connection loss if you plan to create multiple connections in Workato that point to the same SAP system.
   
   ![soauth2 configuration](/assets/soauth2-create.DfNDu3h1.png)
   
   ![soauth2 client configuration](/assets/soauth2-client.BW0sX6Fl.png)
   
3. Based on the chosen grant type, select the **Grant Type Authorization Code Active** or **Grant Type Client Credentials Active** and **Refresh Allowed** checkboxes. Maintain the **Redirect URI** with [callback URI](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/guides/authentication/oauth/auth-code#step-3-defining-client-id-client-secret-authorization-url-and-token-url) for your data center. ![soauth2 grant type settings](/assets/soauth2-granttype.HwpY7oGk.png)
   
4. Click **Add** and select the scope you plan to use from the list. For example: the selected scope `ZAPI_SALES_ORDER_SRV_0001` provides access to the `API_SALES_ORDER_SRV` service. ![scope assignment](/assets/soauth2-scope.lgO72Y00.png)
   
5. Click **Next**, review the summary, and then click **Finish**.
   
6. Your OAuth2.0 Client ID setup is complete. ![scope assignment](/assets/soauth2-created.eZdHMspC.png)
   

## Connection fields

Complete the following fields in Workato to finish establishing your connection:

> **ODATA VERSIONS**
> 
> We recommend that you create dedicated connections for V2 and V4 APIs.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Connection name | Provide the connection with a descriptive name so you can reuse it in other recipes. |
| Connection type | Choose an on-prem agent running on the same domain as the on-premise SAP system. Before attempting to connect, make sure you have an active on-prem agent. |
| Authentication type | Select `OAuth2.0 Authorization code` or `OAuth2.0 Client credentials`. |
| OData version | Select the OData version for the API you plan to use in this connection - `v2` or `v4`. |
| Client ID | Enter the userID created during the OAuth connection setup. |
| Client Secret | Enter the password. This is the password you either generated or added during the OAuth connection setup. |
| Scopes | Provide the scopes you plan to use to access your SAP OData system. For example: `ZAPI_SALES_ORDER_SRV_0001`. You must separate multiple scopes with a comma. |
| Host | The base path of your SAP OData services. For example, if the service URL is `https://www.myS4HanaSystem.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_SALES_ORDER_SRV`, then your host is `https://www.myS4HanaSystem.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/`. |
| Service | Provide a sample service that you can use to test authentication. This can be the first service that you configured. For example, if the service URL is `https://www.myS4HanaSystem.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_SALES_ORDER_SRV`, then your Service is `API_SALES_ORDER_SRV`. |
| SAP client | Provide the SAP client in which this OData service exists. For example, if the service URL is `https://www.myS4HanaSystem.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_SALES_ORDER_SRV?sap-client=100`, then your sap client is `100`. If you do not specify a client, the default client set in SAP is used. |
| Bypass SSO/SAML2 | Only valid for `OAuth2.0 Authorization code`. Select `Yes` to establish a connection to the SAP system by bypassing SAML 2.0 setup with a non-federated user. |
