> Connect SAP OData to Workato using OAuth 2.0 SAML Bearer Assertion through SAP BTP destination authentication for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition.

# OAuth Business Technology Platform (BTP) Authentication

Workato supports OAuth 2.0 (Open Authorization 2.0) through SAP BTP Destination Authentication Method using OAuth2SAMLBearerAssertion. OAuth 2.0 SAML Bearer Assertion is a way of using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) assertions as authorization grants in OAuth 2.0. This flow allows systems that rely on SAML for authentication to leverage OAuth 2.0 for accessing OAuth-protected resources, combining the strengths of both protocols. This authentication is applicable for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition.

## Configuration prerequisites for OAuth BTP

- Access to SAP S/4HANA Cloud with the catalogs `SAP_CORE_BC_EXT` and `SAP_CORE_BC_COM` assigned to the business user.
- Access to SAP Business Technology Platform.
- Admin access to a SAP Cloud Identity provider such as SAP Cloud Identity Services.

### Establish trust and federation

Complete the steps to [manually establish trust and federation between SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service and Identity Authentication](https://help.sap.com/docs/authorization-and-trust-management-service/authorization-and-trust-management/manually-establish-trust-and-federation-between-uaa-and-identity-authentication) and do the following:

- **Establish Trust with an SAML 2.0 Identity Provider in a Subaccount**: You must use a SAML 2.0 identity provider, for example, SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication. The identity provider authenticates business users for SAP BTP.
- **Register SAP BTP Subaccount in the SAML 2.0 Identity Provider**: To establish trust between an identity provider and a Subaccount, you must register your subaccount by providing the SAML metadata to the identity provider. The identity provider is SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication.

### Create signing certificate from SAP BTP

The SAML assertion sent to SAP S/4HANA Cloud is signed using the private key of the local service provider. To enable SAP S/4HANA Cloud to verify this signature, the relevant certificate is required.

1. Log in to SAP BTP Cockpit.
   
2. Create a Signing Certificate from the SAP BTP Account by navigating to **Destinations** under Connectivity and clicking **Download Trust**. ![OAuth BTP Trust](/assets/oauth-btp-trust.DyscsEoF.png)
   

## Implementation steps in the SAP S/4HANA Cloud System

Complete the steps to [allow inbound communication to the SAP S/4HANA tenant](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_EXTENSIBILITY_EXPLORER/8ce29283d61a4bca96e9e7d87c95baa3/a53d6d9c482f47a1b9e65712db544d70.html) and do the following:

1. Create Communication System and User.
2. Create Communication Arrangement.
3. Maintain Business User in the SAP S/4HANA Cloud System.

## Implementation steps on SAP Business Technology Platform

1. Complete these steps to [create and configure a destination in SAP BTP](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_EXTENSIBILITY_EXPLORER/8ce29283d61a4bca96e9e7d87c95baa3/4673c0fb402c45a78ff78b4baef8f73e.html).  
     
   Maintain the values of the properties as suggested in the following sample table:
