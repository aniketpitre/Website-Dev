> The Okta connector lets you automate identity workflows: create, update, delete, activate, and suspend users, manage group membership, and trigger on events.

# Okta

[Okta](https://www.okta.com/) is a cloud service that organizes workforce and customer identities.

It provides cloud software that helps companies to manage secure user authentication for modern applications and helps developers to build identity controls into applications, web services, and devices.

## API version

The Okta connector uses the [Core Okta API v1](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api-overview/).

## Connection setup

Okta supports the following authentication types:

- [Authorization code grant authentication (OAuth 2.0)](#authorization-code-grant-authentication)
- [Client credentials-based authentication (OAuth 2.0)](#client-credentials-based-authentication)
- [API key-based authentication](#api-key-based-authentication)

Workato recommends using either authorization code grant authentication (OAuth 2.0) or client credentials-based authentication (OAuth 2.0) for improved security in your connection. These methods also let you define granular permissions that control which resources Workato can access in Okta.

> **VIRTUAL PRIVATE WORKATO (VPW) CUSTOMERS**
> 
> This feature requires configuration steps that are specific to your Virtual Private Workato (VPW) instance. If you are a VPW customer, refer to your VPW private documentation for the configuration details for your instances.

### Authorization code grant authentication

Authorization code grant authentication requires generating a client ID and secret in Okta.

#### Minimum and default scopes

OAuth 2.0 scopes define the level of access Workato has to your Okta instance. Review the following sections to determine which scopes to assign to your app integration for OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant authentication.

View minimum scopes

The Okta connector requires the following minimum scopes to establish a connection to Okta using authorization code grant authentication:

- `okta.logs.read`
- `okta.schemas.read`
- `offline_access`
- `openid`

View additional scopes

Select any additional scopes required for your use case from those defined in your Okta instance in \*\*Applications > Applications > Okta API Scopes\*\*. Select \`okta.users.read\` to connect using a custom role.

View default scopes

Workato requests the following default scopes if you don't select specific scopes:

- `okta.logs.read`
- `okta.schemas.read`
- `offline_access`
- `openid`
- `okta.eventHooks.manage`
- `okta.users.manage`
- `okta.groups.manage`
- `okta.apps.read`

#### Create an app integration and secret for authorization code grant authentication

Complete the following steps to create an app integration and secret for authorization code grant authentication:

1. Sign in to your Okta organization as a user with administrator privileges.
   
2. Go to the Okta **Admin Console** and select **Applications > Applications**.
   
3. Click **Create App Integration**.
   
4. Find the **Sign-in method** section, and select **OIDC - OpenID Connect**.
   
5. Go to the **Application type** section and select **Web Application**.
   
6. Enter a unique **App integration name** on the **New Web App Integration** page.
   
   ![Create a new app integration](/assets/okta-create-new-app-integration.BLeNUhIg.png) _Create a new app integration_
   
7. Ensure the **Require Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) header in token requests** field is deselected.
   
8. Select the following checkboxes in the **Client acting on behalf of a user** field of the **Grant type** section:
   
   - Authorization Code

12. Go to **General Settings** and ensure the **Proof of possession** field is deselected.
    
13. Go to the **Okta API Scopes** tab and assign the necessary [scopes](#authorization-code-grant-scopes) to the app integration. The connection requires the following scopes at a minimum:
    
    - `okta.logs.read`
    - `okta.schemas.read`
    
    `offline_access` and `openid` permissions are assigned automatically.
    
    The connection requires the following additional scope if you are using a custom role:
    
    - `okta.users.read`

8. Provide your **Client secret**.
   
9. Expand the **Advanced settings** section and use the **OAuth 2.0 scopes** drop-down menu to select additional OAuth 2.0 scopes for this connection. The scopes must match the scopes defined in your Okta instance in **Applications > Applications > Okta API Scopes**.
   
   Workato requests the scopes you specify in addition to the [minimum required scopes](#authorization-code-grant-scopes). Workato requests the default scopes if you don't select specific scopes.
   
10. Click **Connect**.
    

### Client credentials-based authentication

Client credentials authentication requires creating a client and private key in Okta.

#### Minimum and default scopes

OAuth 2.0 scopes define the level of access Workato has to your Okta instance. Review the following sections to determine which scopes to assign to your app integration for OAuth 2.0 client credentials authentication. Your app integration must be assigned the `Read-only Administrator` role in Okta if your connection uses more than the minimum required scopes. If your app integration uses a custom role, you can assign it an applicable custom role instead.

### API key-based authentication

API key authentication requires generating an API key in Okta.

#### Generate an API key

  

> **API KEY PRIVILEGES AND LIMITATIONS**
> 
> You must have administrator privileges in Okta to create an API key. Ensure that you're logged in as an administrator before you proceed.
> 
> Workato requires that the user and API key used in the connection have **Organization Administrator** or **Super Administrator** permissions. API keys inherit all permissions from the administrator who created them and can't be restricted to specific resources or operations. We recommend that you use a scoped OAuth 2.0 access token for improved security.
> 
> Refer to [Create an API token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/create-the-token/) for more information.

Complete the following steps to generate an API key in Okta:

1. Sign in to Okta.
   
2. Go to **Security > API > Token**.
   
3. Click **Create token** to generate an API key. The key inherits the permissions of the administrator who created it.
