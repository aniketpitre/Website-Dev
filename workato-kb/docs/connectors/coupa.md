> The Coupa connector lets you automate spend management: create and search objects, manage purchase orders and suppliers, and trigger on object changes.

# Coupa

[Coupa](https://www.coupa.com/) is a business spend management platform. It supports procurement, invoicing, expense, and payment functions for enterprises. Coupa enables you to create and approve procurement processes including requisitions and invoices. It also has an integrated expense module that enables you to submit and approve expense reports directly in Coupa. This information is typically synced with ERP systems such as [NetSuite](/en/connectors/netsuite), [Oracle EBS](/en/connectors/oracle-ebs), or [SAP](/en/connectors/sap) for other business functions such as accounting or making payments.

## API version

The Coupa connector uses the [Coupa Core REST API](https://compass.coupa.com/en-us/products/product-documentation/integration-technical-documentation/the-coupa-core-api).

## Coupa OAuth 2.0 connection setup

The Coupa connector has supported OAuth 2.0-based connectivity since January 2022. OAuth connections are more secure than API key-based connections. OAuth lets you specify the exact scopes you plan to use in the Workato connection settings. The Coupa connector supports OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials and OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant connections. Refer to [OpenID Connect Clients](https://compass.coupa.com/en-us/products/product-documentation/integration-technical-documentation/the-coupa-core-api/oauth-2.0-and-oidc/openid-connect-clients) for more information.

### API key authentication

API keys are keys you generate to let Coupa know this Workato connection is allowed to work with your information. Complete the following steps to generate your Coupa API key.

1. Sign in to your Coupa account or go to your Coupa instance. For example: `https://[your-instance-name].coupacloud.com/api_keys`.
   
2. Go to **Setup > Integrations > API Keys**.
   
3. Provide a unique name for the connection in the **Connection name** field.
   
4. Enter the **Host** and **API key**.
   
5. Click **Link your account**.
   

> **API KEY AUTHENTICATION DEPRECATED**
> 
> Coupa no longer supports API key authentication for connection to Workato. Use an OAuth method to connect Coupa to Workato. Refer to [OAuth 2.0 and OIDC](https://compass.coupa.com/en-us/products/product-documentation/integration-technical-documentation/the-coupa-core-api/oauth-2.0-and-oidc) for more information.

## Coupa connector objects

Use the following objects, fields, and return types with the Coupa connector:

### Objects

Coupa data is grouped into objects in Workato actions and triggers. You must specify whether you plan to create a purchase order or an invoice when you select an action such as **Create Object**.

The following list provides common Coupa objects. Refer to the Coupa [Resources](https://compass.coupa.com/en-us/products/product-documentation/integration-technical-documentation/the-coupa-core-api/resources) documentation to view a complete list of Coupa objects. You can use custom actions to send custom HTTP requests if you plan to use an action that isn't included in the connector.

### Custom object fields in Coupa

The Coupa connector on Workato automatically pulls all custom fields when you request an object. Use the **Add/remove optional fields** drop-down menu to select the custom fields you've defined.

### Return types in Coupa

Records in Coupa can be large due to multiple attributes. This may result in time outs or slow performance when retrieving a batch of records. Use the **Return type** input field to control the amount of data retrieved per record to improve retrieval. The output datatree that describes the record changes automatically updates to match the input fields you select. The following return types are available:

- **Default**: This is the default option on the Coupa Connector. All fields and child attributes are returned.
- **Shallow**: All attributes or fields of the object are called, and the IDs and natural keys of the one-deep associations are returned.
- **Limited**: Only ID's are returned. This is supported for all commands.
