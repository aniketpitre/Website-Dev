> Register a custom OAuth 2.0 client with the scopes your use case needs and use it with the Workato HTTP connector or SDK.

# Registering a new client

The prebuilt Workato connectors are designed to meet most of your business needs. However, there are instances with requirements that go beyond the scope of Workato's prebuilt connectors.

## Why register a new client

In cases where the scope of the prebuilt connector is insufficient, you must register a custom client with relevant scopes to satisfy your use-case.

This applies only to connectors that use OAuth 2.0 authentication. These connectors use OAuth 2.0 clients to interact with the API on behalf of your account, and usually have a fixed set of scopes attached to it. This means that the connector may not be able to interact with all the endpoints of an API.

#### Use custom clients with Workato connected apps

To use a custom client, you must create a custom connector. Use your custom client credentials with the [HTTP universal connector](/en/developing-connectors/http-v2) or the [SDK](/en/developing-connectors/sdk). This enables you to use the additional scopes from your custom client together with other connectors on Workato's platform.

## Callback URL

Many cloud apps use OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Part of the OAuth 2.0 flow involves a callback URL (or **Redirect URL**). Some cloud apps, like Google, require you to register this callback URL at the point of client registration. It may also involve authorizing this URL. This is a security measure to prevent unwanted access to your account. If you do not register the callback URL, you may encounter an error like this.

### Universal Callback URL

Use the following callback URL to complete the OAuth flow with Workato, regardless of your data center region:

- If you are using platform connectors or a custom OAuth profile, configure the callback URL:
  
  - `https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback`
- For custom connectors, use the URL configured in the custom connector code:
  
  - `https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback` or
  - `https://app.workato.com/oauth/callback`

The universal callback URL ensures you avoid any "400 Error. Redirect URI mismatch" issues.

## Register a new client with a callback URL

The following steps provide an example of how to register a new client on the Google Cloud Platform.

1. Select **Create credentials > OAuth client ID**.
   
   ![Google Cloud Platform API Credentials](/assets/gcp-api-credentials.ktlPu9lO.png)_Google Cloud Platform API Credentials_
   
2. Select **Web application** and enter the name you plan to use in the **Name** field.
   
3. Enter the callback URL in the **Authorized redirect URIs** field:
   
   - If you are using platform connectors or a custom OAuth profile, configure the callback URL as `https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback`.
   - For custom connectors, use the URL configured in the custom connector code:
     - `https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback` or
     - `https://app.workato.com/oauth/callback`
   
   ![Create OAuth client ID](/assets/create-oauth-client-web-app.B3Xj3S14.png)_Create OAuth client ID_
   
   > **INVALID REDIRECT MESSAGE**
   > 
   > This step is where most people encounter an **Invalid Redirect** message. To resolve this, select **authorized domains list**.
   >

4. Click **Create > [Client credentials](#retrieve-client-credentials)**. The OAuth consent screen page displays. Alternatively, you can access this page by selecting **APIs & Services > Credentials > OAuth consent**.

5. Enter `Workato` in the **Application name** field.

6. Select **Add scope** and enter the following scopes:
   
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user`
   
   ![Add scope](/assets/add-scope.OtQ0HeSa.png)_Add scope_
   
7. Enter `workato.com` in the **Authorized domains** field and click **Save**.
   
   ![Authorize Workato.com](/assets/authorize-workato.bzYBQOT2.png)_Authorize Workato.com_
   
8. Click **Create credentials > OAuth client ID**.
   
   ![Google Cloud Platform API Credentials](/assets/gcp-api-credentials.ktlPu9lO.png)_Google Cloud Platform API Credentials_
   
9. Click **Web application** and enter the name you plan to use in the **Name** field.
   
10. Enter `https://app.workato.com/oauth/callback` in the **Authorized redirect URIs** field and click **Create**.
    
    ![Accepted redirect URL](/assets/valid-authoized-redirect-uri.Br9eVZpE.png)_Accepted redirect URL_
    
    Your custom client is now on Google Cloud Platform.

## Retrieve client credentials

Now your custom client is ready to be connected to Workato. Open your custom client (for example, `Workato`) to view the client credentials. You will need the **client ID** and **client secret** for OAuth 2.0 authentication.

#### Frequently encountered problems

We noticed that some of our customers were misdirected to verify the domain `http://www.workato.com` on Google Cloud Platform like in the screenshot below.

**This is not a required step.** If you find yourself at this page, return to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials** ([Step 1](#register-a-new-client-with-a-callback-url)).
