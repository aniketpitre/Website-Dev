> Configure the New event via polling trigger in Workato to fetch events from an API endpoint at each polling interval with a GET request.

# HTTP connector - New event via polling trigger

The **New event via polling** trigger fetches events at each polling interval. Workato makes a `GET` request to the URL you provide. The number of events retrieved for each poll depends on the API endpoint that you send the request to.

You must create an [HTTP connection](/en/developing-connectors/http/connection-setup) before you can configure an HTTP trigger.

> **REAL-TIME TRIGGER**
> 
> You can use the [New event via webhook trigger](/en/connectors/workato-webhooks/wizard) if your use case requires your recipe to respond to trigger events in real-time.

> **PAGINATION NOT SUPPORTED**
> 
> This trigger only reads the first page of records in APIs that enforce pagination. You can set up a trigger with the [connector SDK](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/guides/building-triggers) if your use case expects a paginated response.

## Response body example

### JSON

For JSON responses, please enclose the sample payload with square brackets. For example:
