> Create an HTTP connection in Workato using auth types like basic, header, query params, OAuth2, and AWS to enable HTTP triggers and actions.

# Create an HTTP connection

You must set up your connection to the app you plan to use before you can configure HTTP [triggers](/en/developing-connectors/http/building-http-trigger) and [actions](/en/developing-connectors/http/building-http-action).

The steps required to create an HTTP connection in Workato vary based on the authentication type you plan to use. The HTTP connector supports the following authentication types:

- [None](#authentication-type-none)
- [Basic](#authentication-type-basic)
- [Header auth](#authentication-type-header-auth)
- [Query params](#authentication-type-query-params)
- [Custom](#authentication-type-custom)
- [OAuth2 (authorization code grant)](#authentication-type-oauth-2-0-authorization-code-grant)
- [OAuth2 (client credentials grant)](#authentication-type-oauth-2-0-client-credentials)
- [AWS access key auth](#authentication-type-aws-key-auth)
- [AWS IAM role auth](#authentication-type-aws-iam-role-auth)
- [Azure OAuth 2 (authorization code grant)](#azure-oauth2-authorization-code-grant-authentication-type)
- [Azure OAuth 2 (client credentials grant)](#azure-oauth2-client-credentials-grant-authentication-type)

## None authentication type

The None authentication type enables you to create a connection without providing authentication details. Use this authentication type when you plan to receive a webhook trigger from an app. Workato generates a URL to direct your webhooks to, and retrieves information from the webhook payload.

Complete the following steps to set up an HTTP connection with the None authentication type:

1. Provide a **Connection name** that identifies your HTTP instance.
   
   ![HTTP connector authentication type: None](/assets/none-authentication.jLHIHRrY.png)_HTTP connector authentication type: None_
   
2. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
3. Use the **Connection type** drop-down menu to select the connection type you plan to use.
   
4. Use the **Authentication type** drop-down menu to select **None**.
   
5. Use the **Endpoint has case-sensitive headers?** drop-down to set the case sensitivity for your connection.

## OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant authentication type

The OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant authentication type enables you to provide third parties with access to your apps without disclosing your username and password. Confidential and public clients use this authentication type to exchange an authorization code for an access token. Workato redirects you to your app to enter your login credentials when you use this authentication type. This enables Workato to act on your behalf when making API requests.

Complete the following steps to set up your HTTP connection with OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant authentication:

1. Provide a **Connection name** that identifies your HTTP instance.

OAuth2 client credentials grant example

#### Connect to Eventbrite with OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant

Go to the app's documentation page to obtain your authorization URL and the access token URL. You must append additional parameters to the URL as specified by the app. For example, Eventbrite requires the following format for a post request:

```
https://www.eventbrite.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_KEY`
```

![Eventbrite OAuth 2.0 authentication page](/assets/eventbrite-authentication.CS42SO4b.png)_Eventbrite OAuth 2.0 authentication page_

The following information is required to enable Workato to handle the client key:

Eventbrite authorization URL:

```
https://www.eventbrite.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code
```

Eventbrite access token URL:

```
https://www.eventbrite.com/oauth/token
```

You must have a client ID and client secret to connect to your Eventbrite account successfully. You must register an app with Eventbrite to obtain these credentials.

Complete the following steps to obtain your credentials:

1. Log in to Eventbrite and navigate to **Account Settings > App Management**.
   
   ![Eventbrite's App Management screen](/assets/eventbrite-app-management.DeyvrOEv.png)_Eventbrite's app management screen_
   
2. Locate your client ID (also called key) in the **App Management** page.
   
3. Expand the **Show Client Secret and OAuth Token** section to retrieve the client secret.
   
4. Navigate to the **App Extension** section to input the callback URL: `https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback`
   

## AWS access key auth authentication type

AWS Access key authentication enables you use access keys you have created as either a root user or an IAM user in AWS. You can assign a maximum of two access keys per user (root user or IAM user). A disabled key can't be used, but it does count toward your quota of two access keys. When you delete an access key, it is permanently removed from the app but can be replaced with a new access key. Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#programmatic-access) for more information.

> **AWS IAM AUTHENTICATION RECOMMENDED**
> 
> We recommend that you use AWS IAM authentication instead of access key authentication.

Complete the following steps to set up your HTTP connection with AWS access key authentication:

1. Provide a **Connection name** that identifies your HTTP instance.
   
   ![HTTP (AWS access key auth) connector's connection fields](/assets/aws-access-key-authentication.BgwqkpTV.png)_HTTP (AWS Access key auth)_

   > The **Endpoint has case-sensitive headers?** field has no effect when the **Wait for response** field is set to **Yes** (async mode) in the [HTTP action](/en/developing-connectors/http/building-http-action). Configure this option only when **Wait for response** is set to **No**.
   
10. Provide your base URL in the **Base URL** field. Recipes can't override this setting.
    
11. Click **Connect**.
    

## AWS IAM role auth authentication type

AWS IAM role authentication enables you to provide a dedicated role in your AWS instance for Workato to use. By provisioning a dedicated IAM profile, the owner of the AWS instance can grant Workato access to AWS resources without sharing AWS security credentials. It also helps to maintain permission boundaries, including controlled access to specific AWS services and actions that are permitted by a third-party application, such as Workato.

We recommend that you only grant required permissions, and avoid using AllAccess policies whenever possible.

> **AWS IAM AUTHENTICATION RECOMMENDED**
> 
> We generally recommend that you use AWS IAM authentication instead of access key authentication.

Complete the following steps to set up your HTTP connection with AWS IAM role authentication:

1. Provide a **Connection name** that identifies your HTTP instance.
   
   ![HTTP (AWS IAM) connector's connection fields](/assets/aws-iam-role-authentication.DYPjy0KJ.png)_HTTP (AWS IAM role auth) connector's connection fields_
   
2. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
3. Use the **Connection type** drop-down menu to select the connection type you plan to use.
   
4. Use the **Authentication type** drop-down menu to select **AWS IAM role auth**.
   
5. Provide your AWS service name in the **AWS name** field.
   
6. Provide your account region in the **Region** field. For example, if your account URL is `https://eu-west-1.console.s3.amazon.com`, your region is `eu-west-1`.
   
7. Provide your IAM role ARN in the **IAM role ARN** field. Refer to the [How to retrieve IAM role ARN](/en/developing-connectors/http/connection-setup#authentication-type-aws-iam-role-auth) section for more information.
   
8. Use the **Endpoint has case-sensitive headers?** drop-down menu to set the case sensitivity for your connection.
   
   > **ASYNC MODE LIMITATION**
   > 
   > The **Endpoint has case-sensitive headers?** field has no effect when the **Wait for response** field is set to **Yes** (async mode) in the [HTTP action](/en/developing-connectors/http/building-http-action). Configure this option only when **Wait for response** is set to **No**.
   
9. Provide your base URL in the **Base URL** field. Recipes can't override this setting.
   
10. Click **Connect**.
    

### How to retrieve IAM role ARN

Use the following steps to retrieve the **Role ARN** required for the connection setup. Remember to use the Workato generated external ID found on the connection page.

1. Go to IAM and select **Roles** > **Create role**.
   
   ![AWS IAM authentication page - create role](/assets/create-new-iam-role.CFxiz0jB.png)
   
2. Select **Another AWS account** and input Workato's Account ID.
   
3. Select **Require external ID** and provide the Workato generated **External ID**.Every Workato user has a unique **External id**, for example, `workato_iam_external_id_77630`. You can find this value in the **IAM role ARN** section of the [connection setup](#authentication-type-aws-iam-role-auth).
   
   ![AWS IAM authentication page - entity type - Another AWS account](/assets/select-trusted-entity.C9aV4iGZ.png)
   
   If you require more granular control over how your HTTP connector is used in Workato, you can configure the connection at the project level by changing the scope of the external ID, [learn more](/en/security/data-protection/secrets-management/iam-role-based-authentication-for-aws)
   
4. Attach permission policies to this role when prompted. This step enables you to provide fine-grained permission controls for Workato. The policies that you attach to this role should be as narrow as possible.
   
5. Select an appropriate tag for the IAM role if you are using object tagging.
   
6. Provide the IAM Role with an appropriate name and description. Workato recommends that you avoid using a non-guessable resource-id in the URN and that you don't include the external ID.
   
   ![Review role](/assets/review-role.Ca7P2F3y.png)
   
   The IAM Role is created.
