## Create authentication logic

Connector Copilot can assist you with creating authentication logic for various APIs. You can share API documentation with Connector Copilot for specific authentication options or proceed without it in a free-form chat. The following sections offer guidance on configuring the authentication for your connector.

### Provide API documentation

Connector Copilot searches for relevant API documentation by browsing the web. If it does not find the necessary information, you can provide the API documentation directly. Provide a URL or copy and paste the documentation. Note that URLs are limited to 10,000 characters. If the URL exceeds this quota, use copy and paste.

> **GET BETTER RESULTS WITH COPY AND PASTE**
> 
> When using copy and paste, specify parts of the documentation that are most relevant for Connector Copilot to generate your authentication. For example, for OAuth 2.0 connections, copying and pasting a guide from the API for the entire flow provides better results.

Based on the provided documentation, Connector Copilot suggests authentication methods compatible with your API. If no suitable options are found, you can [provide your own authentication method](#build-custom-authentication).

### Build custom authentication

Alternatively, you can build the authentication step by step with Connector Copilot’s assistance. Connector Copilot prompts you for the necessary details, such as the type of authentication, endpoints, and any specific parameters required, helping you construct the method one step at a time.

### General guidance for all authentication types

When setting up authentication, it is crucial to provide Connector Copilot with comprehensive information. This includes specifying the authentication type, the base URI of the external system, and a test endpoint to verify the connection. These commonalities ensure that Connector Copilot can accurately construct the necessary code.

### Common authentication types

To ensure Connector Copilot can generate precise and effective authentication logic, provide as much relevant context as possible. Here are the details needed for specific authentication types:

#### OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant

The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant is typically used for web server applications. This flow involves redirecting the user to an authorization server to obtain an authorization code, which is then exchanged for access tokens. For this method, provide Connector Copilot the following details:

- Authorization URL
  
- The endpoint where users are redirected to authenticate.
  
- Token URL
  
- The endpoint used to exchange the authorization code for access tokens.
  
- Logic for acquiring access tokens
  
- Provide logic for how to obtain access tokens after authorization.
  
- Logic for refreshing access tokens
  
- Provide logic for how to refresh access tokens when they expire.
  

#### OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant

The OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant is used for server-to-server communication, where no user interaction is involved. This flow involves using client credentials to obtain access tokens directly. For this method, provide Connector Copilot with the following details:

- Token URL
  
- The endpoint used to obtain access tokens using client credentials.
  
- Logic for acquiring access tokens
  
- Provide logic for how to obtain access tokens using client credentials.
  

#### Basic authentication

Basic authentication involves sending a username and password with each API request. These credentials are typically encoded in base64. Provide Connector Copilot logic for including the basic auth credentials in API requests, covering the encoding process and the exact HTTP header format required.

#### API key authentication

API key authentication involves sending an API key with each API request, either in the request headers or as a query parameter. Provide Connector Copilot logic for including the API key in the API requests, detailing whether the key should be in the header or a query parameter and the exact format expected by the API.

### Additional authentication types

Connector Copilot is also capable of handling other types of authentication. When using these methods, provide as much relevant context as possible, such as specific endpoints, parameters, and logic required to authenticate effectively. By providing detailed and accurate information, you enable Connector Copilot to structure your code precisely and effectively.

### Review and adjust your connection

After Connector Copilot generates the connection block code, complete the following steps to review, adjust, and test your connection:

1. Review the generated code and make any necessary adjustments. Connector Copilot uses the provided details to generate the connection block code.
   
2. Copy and paste the code Connector Copilot generated into the connector code interface. Remember to replace the existing `connection: { }`.
   
3. Switch to the **Test code** tab to test the generated connection. You must supply the relevant credentials to authenticate your connection.
   
   ![Test your connection](/assets/test-connection.BpcBef-P.png)_Test your connection_
   
4. Review the authentication logic in the **Recent tests** tab. You can also review the input and output of the authentication and any API calls that were made in the process.
   

## Generate an action

Creating an action involves defining how to interact with a specific API endpoint. After creating the connection, Connector Copilot may ask if you plan to create an action. Alternatively, you can type in the prompt saying you plan to create an action.

### Provide API documentation

Connector Copilot searches for relevant API documentation by browsing the web. If it does not find the necessary information, you can provide the API documentation directly. Provide a URL or copy and paste the documentation. Note that URLs are limited to 10,000 characters. If the URL exceeds this quota, use copy and paste.

> **GET BETTER RESULTS WITH COPY AND PASTE**
> 
> When copying and pasting API documentation, specify the parts that are most relevant for Connector Copilot to generate your action. For example, for a **Create Invoice** action, copying and pasting the documentation that includes the verb, endpoint, input and output parameters provides better results.

Based on the provided documentation, Connector Copilot suggests action components compatible with your API. If no suitable options are found, you can manually [define the action components](#define-action-components) with Connector Copilot’s assistance.

### Define action components

Connector Copilot assists you in defining the components of an action. While Connector Copilot gathers this information automatically, you can enhance the accuracy by providing the following details:

- Action name
  
- A unique identifier for the action, typically in the format `verb_object`. For example, `create_contact`.
  
- Action title
  
- A title for the action in verb-object format. For example, `Create contact`.
  
- Action description
  
- A detailed description of the action.
  
- HTTP method
  
- The HTTP method to use for the API request, such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, or HEAD.
  
- Execute URI
  
- The API endpoint to call, with any path parameters denoted by curly braces. For example: `/v1/contacts/{id}`.
  
- API content type
  
- The content type expected by the API endpoint, such as JSON, XML, URL\_FORM\_ENCODED, or MULTIPART.
  
- Request headers
  
- Optional. Any required request headers except for those related to authentication and content type.
  
- Request path parameters
  
- Optional. Any path, query, or body parameters required by the API endpoint.
  

### Review and adjust your action

After Connector Copilot generates the action code, complete the following steps to review, adjust, and test your action:

1. Review the code Connector Copilot generates for the action. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure it meets your requirements.
   
2. Copy and paste the code Connector Copilot generated into the connector code interface. Remember to replace the existing `actions: { }`.
   
3. Switch to the **Test code** tab to test the generated action. You must have a working [connection](#create-authentication-logic) to perform the test.
