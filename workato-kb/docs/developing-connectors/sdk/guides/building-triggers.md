> Learn how to build triggers in the Workato connector SDK, including polling, static webhook, dynamic webhook, and hybrid triggers.

# Building triggers

Triggers are a crucial part of any connector. They allow users of your connector to trigger recipes in Workato based on events in your target application. There are multiple types of related triggers available in Workato:

- Polling triggers
- Static webhook triggers
- Dynamic webhook triggers
- Hybrid triggers (Webhooks + polling)

> **TIP**
> 
> Before we start, it is also important to get familiar with the different types of [HTTP request methods](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/http) which power all triggers.

### General structure of triggers
