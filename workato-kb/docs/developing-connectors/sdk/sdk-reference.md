> Reference for the Workato connector SDK root keys, including connection, actions, triggers, object_definitions, methods, and streams.

# SDK Reference

This is the full list of all possible attributes that you can include in your Workato connector. This section is organized by the root keys of a connector:

- `connection` - Handles all aspects pertaining to how your connector should establish a connection with a target API.
- `test` - Works hand in hand with the `connection` key to verify that a connection has been successfully established.
- `actions` - Contains the definition of all actions in your connector.
- `triggers` - Contains the definition of all triggers in your connector.
- `object_definitions` - Define commonly used input or output fields and reference them later on in your actions and triggers.
- `pick_lists` - Used to generate drop-downs in input fields.
- `methods` - Create reusable methods which can be called from anywhere in your connector.
- `secure_tunnel` - Used to created OPA compatible connectors to communicate with on-premise systems.
- `webhook_keys` - Used in conjunction with Static webhook triggers.
- `streams` - Used in conjunction with actions and triggers to implement file streaming.

In addition to this, the SDK reference also contains the following information regarding

- Defining input and output fields
- Using HTTP Methods to send requests
- Available ruby methods that can be used in your connector code

## Sample Connector Skeleton

Each connector in Workato is a big hash that contains the root keys detailed above. Below, we have an example of a summarized connector. Not all keys are required.

```ruby
{
  title: 'My sample connector',

  connection: Hash,

  test: lambda do
    Boolean
  end,

  custom_action: Boolean,

  custom_action_help: Hash,

  actions: Hash,

  triggers: Hash,

  object_definitions: Hash,

  pick_lists: Hash,

  methods: Hash,

  secure_tunnel: Boolean,

  webhook_keys: lambda do
    String
  end,

  streams: Hash
}
```
