* * *

## workato

Root command of the Workato gem. Synonymous with [`workato help`](#workato-help).

### Usage

```shell
$ workato
```

### Output

Description of commands available in the Workato gem.

| **\-n or --connection** | The connection name in the `settings.yaml` file. Only required if there are multiple credential sets. |
| **\-i or --input** | The path to the JSON file that stores the input. Used for `execute`, `webhook_notification`, or `poll` lambdas. |

| **\--redirect-url** | The redirect-url used to invoke the `refresh` lambda function. |
| **\--refresh-token** | The refresh-token used to invoke the `refresh` lambda function. |
| **\--verbose** | Include this option to make the execution verbose. This means that all HTTP requests and request payloads will be shown. Response bodies won't be shown but can be inspected with `byebug`. |
| **\--debug** | Include this option to show errors from the entire stacktrace, rather than just the last encountered error. |

### Result

The output of the lambda function.

### Examples

Invoke a specific method.

```bash

```

Invoke the acquire lambda. Connector and settings are all specified.

```bash
workato exec connection.authorization.acquire --connector='zoominfo.rb' --settings='settings.yaml' --connection='My Valid Connection' --verbose

## workato new

Creates a new connector project in your chosen directory.  
  
When you create a new connector project, you will be asked if you want to select `secure` or `simple` for your HTTP mocking behavior:

```bash
Please select default HTTP mocking behavior suitable for your project?

1 - secure. Cause an error to be raised for any unknown requests, all request recordings are encrypted.
            To record a new cassette you need set VCR_RECORD_MODE environment variable

            Example: VCR_RECORD_MODE=once bundle exec rspec spec/actions/test_action_spec.rb

2 - simple. Record new interaction if it is a new request, requests are stored as plain text and expose secret tokens.
```

When you select `secure`, VCR recordings made for your unit tests are encrypted. **This is recommended.** You'll need to set your environment variable for `VCR_RECORD_MODE` as well.

### Usage

```bash
$ workato new <PATH>
```

### Input

| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **PATH** | The path where the connector project should be created. |

### Result

Generates a new connector project.

### Example

```bash
$ workato new ~/Desktop/my-new-connector
```

## workato oauth2

Use this to implement the OAuth2 Authorization code grant flow for applicable connectors. Applicable connectors are ones where the connection hash has \`type: 'oauth2\`. For more information, check out this handy [Okta article](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/04/10/oauth-authorization-code-grant-type).

> **GEM VERSION REQUIREMENT**
> 
> The command `workato oauth2` requires SDK Gem version 0.1.2 and above.

### Usage

```bash
$ workato oauth2 <OPTIONS>
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **\-c or --connector** | The path to the connector source code. Defaults to `connector.rb` if not provided. |
| **\-s or --settings** | The path to the `settings.yaml` file that stores the credentials. Defaults to `settings.yaml.enc`, then `settings.yaml` if not provided. |
| **\-n or --connection** | The connection name in the `settings.yaml` file. Only required if there are multiple credential sets. |
| **\--key, -k** | The path to the encrypt/decrypt key. If this isn't provided, defaults to `master.key`. If a `master.key` file doesn't exist and no option is provided, a new `master.key` file is created. |
| **\--port** | By default, the SDK Gem spins up a webserver at "http://localhost:45555/oauth/callback" which is used to receive the OAuth callback. Use this option to change the port. i.e. --port='3010' will spin up the webserver at "http://localhost:3010/oauth/callback" This is useful when your OAuth app is configured to a specific redirect uri. |
| **\--ip** | Allows you to override the default ip address. Defaults to "127.0.0.1" |
| **\--https, --no-https** | Allows you to start the webserver with a self-signed certificate. Required in cases where the OAuth App requires a redirect uri with a "https://" prefix. |
| **\--verbose** | Include this option to make the execution verbose. This means that all HTTP requests and request payloads will be shown. Response bodies won't be shown but can be inspected with `byebug`. |

### Result
