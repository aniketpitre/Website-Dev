# How-to guides - Running Picklists on CLI

In this segment, we will be going through how you can run methods Picklists the Workato Gem.

## Prerequisites

- You have installed and can run the Workato SDK Gem. Read our [getting-started guide](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/cli/guides/getting-started) to know more.
- You have a working connector with at least 1 method. You use the sample connector provided below.
- You have a working set of credentials. If you are using a sample connector code, ensure that you have the appropriate credentials for the connector.

## Sample connector - Chargebee

The code in `connector.rb`.

```ruby
{
  title: 'Chargebee-demo',

  connection: {
    fields: [
      {
        name: 'api_key',
        control_type: 'password',
        hint: 'You can find your API key final change3' \
          "under 'Settings'=>'Configure Chargebee'=>'API Keys and Webhooks'" \
          " in Chargebee's web console.",
        label: 'Your API Key'
      },
      {
        name: 'domain',
        control_type: 'subdomain',
        url: 'chargebee.com'
      }
    ],

    authorization: {
      type: 'basic_auth',

      apply: lambda do |connection|
        user(connection['api_key'])
      end
    },

    base_uri: lambda do |connection|
      "https://#{connection['domain']}.chargebee.com"
    end
  },

  test: lambda do |_connection|
    get('/api/v2/plans', limit: 1)
  end,

  pick_lists: {

    static: lambda do
      [
        %w[Subscription subscription],
        %w[Customer customer],
        %w[Plans plan]
      ]
    end,

    dynamic: lambda do
      get('/api/v2/customers')['list'].map do |index|
          [
            index['customer']['first_name'],
            index['customer']['id']
          ]
      end
    end,

    dependent: lambda do |connection, params|
      get('/api/v2/customers', params)['list'].map do |index|
          [
            index['customer']['first_name'],
            index['customer']['id']
          ]
      end
    end,

    dependent_with_names: lambda do |connection, limit:|
      get('/api/v2/customers', limit: limit)['list'].map do |index|
          [
            index['customer']['first_name'],
            index['customer']['id']
          ]
      end
    end

  },
}
```

Credentials in `settings.yaml.enc` .

```yaml
api_key: valid_api_key
domain: valid_domain
```

> **TIP**
> 
> If you're using an encrypted settings.yaml file, you will need to use `workato edit <PATH>` to edit or create the file. Refer to [workato edit](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/cli/reference/cli-commands#workato-edit) for more information on editing encrypted files.

With the SDK Gem, you'll be able to invoke a picklist individually.

## Example 1. Running the `static` pick\_list

The first pick\_list we will cover in the example above is the `static` pick\_list. Like it's name suggests, it stores a static list of values and when invoked, will just return this value.

Here is an example the pick\_list being run:

```shell
$ workato exec pick_lists.static
[
  [
    "Subscription",
    "subscription"
  ],
  [
    "Customer",
    "customer"
  ],
  [
    "Plans",
    "plan"
  ]
]
```

## Example 2. Running the `dynamic` pick\_list

The next pick\_list is one that sends a request out and massages the response into a pick\_list format. Here, the connection settings required to authorize the request is assumed to be the default `settings.yaml.enc` file. If this is not what you want, you can use `--settings` to override this.

Here is an example the pick\_list being run:

```shell
$ workato exec pick_lists.dynamic
[
  [
    "dd",
    "AzyuHzSiORQAo1JUb"
  ],
  [
    "fdsfdf",
    "16Bji8SfZHHDm7v"
  ]
]
```

## Example 3. Running the `dependent` pick\_list

The next pick\_list is one that sends a request out and massages the response into a pick\_list format. Here, the connection settings required to authorize the request is assumed to be the default `settings.yaml.enc` file. If this is not what you want, you can use `--settings` to override this.

The `fixtures/pick_lists/dependent/input.json` file in this example contains the following:

```JSON
{
    "limit": "1"
}
```

Here is an example the pick\_list being run:

```shell
$ workato exec pick_lists.dependent --args='fixtures/pick_lists/dependent/input.json'
[
  [
    "dd",
    "AzyuHzSiORQAo1JUb"
  ]
]
```

## Example 4. Running the `dependent_with_names` pick\_lists

In other cases, you might have a picklist that accepts named arguments. In this case, this picklist has the named argument `limit:`.

When you pass the arguments via CLI, the contents of the file `fixtures/pick_lists/dependent_with_names/input.json` should look like this:

```JSON
{
    "limit": "1"
}
```

Here is an example the pick\_list being run:

```shell
$ workato exec pick_lists.dependent_with_names --args='fixtures/pick_lists/dependent_with_names/input.json'
[
  [
    "dd",
    "AzyuHzSiORQAo1JUb"
  ]
]
```
