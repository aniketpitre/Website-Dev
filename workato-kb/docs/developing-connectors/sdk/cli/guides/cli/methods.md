# How-to guides - Running methods on CLI

In this segment, we will be going through how you can run methods using the Workato Gem.

## Prerequisites

- You have installed and can run the Workato SDK Gem. Read our [getting-started guide](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/cli/guides/getting-started) to know more.
- You have a working connector with at least 1 method. You use the sample connector provided below.
- You have a working set of credentials. If you are using a sample connector code, ensure that you have the appropriate credentials for the connector.

## Sample connector - Chargebee

The code in `connector.rb`.

```ruby
{
  title: 'Chargebee-demo',

  connection: {
    fields: [
      {
        name: 'api_key',
        control_type: 'password',
        hint: 'You can find your API key final change3' \
          "under 'Settings'=>'Configure Chargebee'=>'API Keys and Webhooks'" \
          " in Chargebee's web console.",
        label: 'Your API Key'
      },
      {
        name: 'domain',
        control_type: 'subdomain',
        url: 'chargebee.com'
      }
    ],

    authorization: {
      type: 'basic_auth',

      apply: lambda do |connection|
        user(connection['api_key'])
      end
    },

    base_uri: lambda do |connection|
      "https://#{connection['domain']}.chargebee.com"
    end
  },

  test: lambda do |_connection|
    get('/api/v2/plans', limit: 1)
  end,

  methods: {
    get_customers: lambda do
      get('/api/v2/customers')
    end,

    sample_method: lambda do |string1, string2|
      string1 + ' ' + string2
    end,
  },
}
```

Credentials in `settings.yaml.enc` .

```yaml
api_key: valid_api_key
domain: valid_domain
```

> **TIP**
> 
> If you're using an encrypted settings.yaml file, you will need to use `workato edit <PATH>` to edit or create the file. Refer to [workato edit](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/cli/reference/cli-commands#workato-edit) for more information on editing encrypted files.

With the SDK Gem, you'll be able to invoke a method individually and gain greater control over how each method works.

## Example 1. Running the `get_customers` method

The `get_customers` method in the preceding example has no declared input arguments. The method fetches customers and returns the API response when the SDK Gem invokes it.

```shell
$ workato exec methods.get_customers
{
  "list": [
    {
      "customer": {
        "id": "abc",
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "doe",
        "email": "john@gmail.com",
        "phone": "+100",
        "auto_collection": "on",
        "net_term_days": 0,
        "allow_direct_debit": false,
        "created_at": 1630848839,
        "taxability": "taxable",
        "updated_at": 1630848840,
        "locale": "en-US",
        "pii_cleared": "active",
        "resource_version": 1630848840782,
        "deleted": false,
        "object": "customer",
        "card_status": "valid",
        "promotional_credits": 0,
        "refundable_credits": 0,
        "excess_payments": 0,
        "unbilled_charges": 0,
        "preferred_currency_code": "SGD",
      }
    }
  ],
  "next_offset": "[\"1630848839000\",\"42903379\"]"
}
```

> **TIP**
> 
> You can also use other options like `--verbose` to see the detailed logs of any HTTP requests sent when your method is ran and `--output` to save the output of the function to a JSON file.
> 
> If no `settings.yaml` file is defined, the SDK Gem will assume the default `settings.yaml.enc` file to utilize for any HTTP requests.

## Example 2. Running the `sample_method` method

The second method we will cover in the example above is the `sample_method` method, which has 2 arguments. You can see that we have referenced an `args` in the command which points to a JSON file stored in our `fixtures` folder. This file should contain an array **where each index in the array corresponds to a single argument.**

The `fixtures/triggers/new_updated_object/customer_input_poll.json` file in this example contains the following:

```JSON
[
    "Hello",
    "world"
]
```

Here is an example the method being run:

```shell
$ workato exec methods.sample_method --args='fixtures/actions/search_customers/customer_config.json'
"Hello world"
```
