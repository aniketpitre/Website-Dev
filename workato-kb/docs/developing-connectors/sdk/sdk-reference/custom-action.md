# SDK Reference - `custom_action`

This section enumerates all the possible keys to define a custom action.

> **Quick Overview**
> 
> The `custom_action` key allows you to quickly define custom actions to unblock users of your connector when no standard action is available to them. Keep in mind that these actions require users to understand certain API concepts like how to find the relevant API endpoints and payload schema.
