> Reference for the connection key in the Workato connector SDK, including fields, extended_fields, authorization, and base_uri.

# SDK Reference - `connection`

This section enumerates all the possible keys available when defining your connection.

> **Quick Overview**
> 
> To put it simply, the `connection` hash contains all the instructions your connector needs to establish a successful connection.
> 
> - The `fields` key tells your connector what input fields to show so it can collect information for authorization.
> - The `extended_fields` key allows you to dynamically show more connection fields based on previous inputs. This field is optional to define.
> - The `authorization` key tells your connector what to do with the information it has collected - use that to exchange it for an access\_token.
> - The `base_uri`key tells your connector what to prepend to every HTTP request after connection is successful. This allows you to use relative paths in your connector code when defining actions and triggers.

## Structure

```ruby
  connection: {
    fields: Array,

    extended_fields: lambda do |connection|
      Array
    end,

    authorization: Hash,

    base_uri: lambda do |connection|
      String
    end
  }
```

* * *

## fields

The 'fields' key has the following attributes:

<dl><dt>Key</dt><dd><code>fields</code></dd><dt>Type</dt><dd>Array</dd><dt>Required</dt><dd>False</dd><dt>Description</dt><dd>Accepts an array of hashes. Each hash in this array corresponds to a separate input field.<br>To learn how to define input fields in Workato, see <a href="/en/developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/schema.html">SDK Reference - Schema</a>.</dd></dl>

### Picklists in connection fields

For fields with `control_type` defined as `select` or `multiselect`, use the `options` attribute to define a static picklist instead of the `pick_list` attribute.

> **Picklist does not apply to connection hash**
> 
> References to any picklists you defined in your connector are not accessible in the `connection` hash because no credentials have been received at this time.

### Example: Connection fields with picklist nested in advanced settings

```ruby
    fields: [
      {
        name: 'api_key',
        control_type: 'password',
        hint: 'You can find your API key final change3' \
          "under 'Settings'=>'Configure Chargebee'=>'API Keys and Webhooks'" \
          " in Chargebee's web console.",
        label: 'Your API Key',
        default: "helloaaaabbb",
        optional: false
      },
      {
        name: 'domain',
        control_type: 'subdomain',
        url: 'chargebee.com'
      },
      {
        name: "advanced_settings",
        type: "object",
        optional: "true",
        properties: [
          {
            name: "environment",
            optional: true,
            control_type: "select",
            options: [
              ["Development", "dev"],
              ["Production", "prod"]
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
```

## extended\_fields

The 'extended\_fields' key has the following attributes:

<dl><dt>Key</dt><dd><code>extended_fields</code></dd><dt>Type</dt><dd>lambda function</dd><dt>Required</dt><dd>False</dd><dt>Description</dt><dd>Allows you to optionally display more input fields based on your connection. The output is expected to be a valid Workato schema. Find out more about <a href="/en/developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/schema.html">SDK Reference - Schema</a>.</dd></dl>

### How to use extended\_fields

With `extended_fields`, you can dynamically display additional fields based on previous input fields. If your connection setup is complex and consists of many input fields, consider limiting the number of fields that a user can see. Instead of displaying all fields at the same time, use `extended_fields` to control how many fields to display to the user initially, and when to display additional fields.

In this case, `extended_fields` provides you with the added benefit of controlling which fields to display for the users during connection setup, and guiding them through the experience. In some cases, you may also restrict some fields from the display when they are not relevant.

### Example: Connection fields with extended\_fields

```ruby
    fields: [
      {
        name: "api_key",
        control_type: "password",
        hint: "You can find your API key " \
          "under 'Settings'=>'Configure Chargebee'=>'API Keys and Webhooks'" \
          " in Chargebee's web console.",
        label: "Your API Key"
      },
      {
        name: "custom_domain",
        label: "Are you using a custom domain?",
        extends_schema: true,
        control_type: "checkbox"
      }
    ],

    extended_fields: lambda do |connection|
      if connection['custom_domain'] == "true"
        [
          {
            name: "domain",
            control_type: "subdomain",
            extends_schema: true,
            url: ".acme.com"
          }
        ]
      end
    end,
```

Workato passes the connection hash to all other lambdas, including `authorization` and `execute`. The connection hash contains values from both `fields` and `extended_fields`.

### Example: Connection fields with extended\_fields and extends\_schema

The following example shows how to use `extends_schema` within `extended_fields` to create a connection setup that has multiple steps.

```ruby
  connection: {
    fields: [
      {
        name: "api_key",
        control_type: "password",
        hint: "You can find your API key " \
          "under 'Settings'=>'Configure Chargebee'=>'API Keys and Webhooks'" \
          " in Chargebee's web console.",
        label: "Your API Key"
      },
      {
        name: "custom_domain",
        label: "Are you using a custom domain?",
        extends_schema: true,
        control_type: "checkbox"
      }
    ],

    extended_fields: lambda do |connection|
        [
          (
            if connection['custom_domain'] == "true"
              {
                name: "domain",
                control_type: "subdomain",
                optional: false,
                url: ".acme.com"
              }
            end
          ),
          (
            if connection['custom_domain'] == "true"
              {
                name: "instance_type",
                control_type: "select",
                extends_schema: true,
                optional: false,
                options: [ ["Production", "production"], ["Sandbox", "sandbox"]]
              }
            end
          ),
          (
            if connection['instance_type'] == "sandbox"
              {
                name: "protocol",
                control_type: "select",
                optional: false,
                options: [ ["HTTPS", "https://"], ["HTTP", "http://"]]
              }
            end
          )
        ].compact
    end,

    authorization: {
      type: 'basic',

      apply: lambda { |connection, access_token|
        headers("x-api-key": "#{connection['api_key']}")
      }
    },

    base_uri: lambda do |connection|
        if connection['custom_domain'] == "true"
          "#{connection['protocol']}#{connection['domain']}.acme.com/"
        else
          "https://api.acme.com/"
        end
    end
  },
```

## authorization

The 'authorization' key has the following attributes:

<dl><dt>Key</dt><dd><code>authorization</code></dd><dt>Type</dt><dd>Hash</dd><dt>Required</dt><dd>True</dd><dt>Description</dt><dd>Accepts an object with child keys corresponding to different types of authentication</dd></dl>

Find out more about the `authorization` hash in [SDK Reference - authorization](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/connection/authorization).

* * *

## base\_uri

The 'base\_uri' key has the following attributes:

<dl><dt>Key</dt><dd><code>base_uri</code></dd><dt>Type</dt><dd>lambda function</dd><dt>Required</dt><dd>False. However, we recommend it.</dd><dt>Description</dt><dd>Defines the base URI for all future HTTP requests.</dd><dt>Possible Arguments</dt><dd><dl class="horizontal-dl"><dt>connection</dt><dd>Hash that represents user-provided inputs defined in <code>Connection</code>.</dd></dl></dd><dt>Expected Output</dt><dd><code>String</code>, such as one of:<br><ul><li><code>"https://#{connection['host']}.com/"</code></li><li><code>"https://api.acme.com"</code></li></ul></dd></dl>

### Configuring your base\_uri

When you define your `base_uri` key, make sure to note the final URI that you provide. There are two scenarios when using `base_uri` in conjunction with any downstream HTTP requests.

1. When you have a preceding "/" (forward slash) in the verb method (such as `get('/hello/there')`), we ignore any path parameters in the `base_uri`.
   
   For example, `https://api.hubapi.com/test/` defined as your `base_uri` effectively becomes `https://api.hubapi.com`. The request is sent to `https://api.hubapi.com/hello/there`.
   
2. If you **don’t** have a preceding "/" (forward slash) in the verb method (such as `get('hello/there')`), we adopt the path parameters in your `base_uri`.
   
   For example, `https://api.hubapi.com/test/` defined as your `base_uri` remains `https://api.hubapi.com/test/`. The request is sent to `https://api.hubapi.com/test/hello/there`.
