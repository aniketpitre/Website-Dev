> Reference for the methods key in the Workato connector SDK, used to define reusable functions callable from any lambda in your connector.

# SDK Reference - `methods`

Reusable methods are supported in Workato. Reusable methods help keep your custom adapter code DRY and may be used in any lambda function in your connector.

> **Quick Overview**
> 
> Reusable methods are the same as custom functions that can be called in any portion of the code. Use them to keep your code concise and maintainable.

## Structure

```ruby
    methods: {

      [Unique_method_name]: lambda do |[unique_argument_name]|
        Array, Hash, String, Int, Boolean
      end,

      [Another_unique_method_name]: lambda do |[unique_argument_name], [another_unique_argument_name]|
        Array, Hash, String, Int, Boolean
      end
    },
```

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Key | `[Unique_method_name]` |
| Type | lambda function |
| Required | True |
| Description | This lambda function can be invoked anywhere in the connector code such as actions, triggers, object\_definitions, or even other methods. This is done by the using the special syntax `call('unique_method_name', input)` |
| Possible Arguments | Arguments can be defined by you. There can be any number of arguments. Splat operators are not allowed. |
| Expected Output | Variable |

Example - methods: - Using a reusable method

Use the `call()` method to reference a method. This method takes in two parameters:

1. The method name - You can use either "method\_name" (string) or :method\_name (symbol) representations.
2. Input fields - This is mapped to the arguments defined in the method definition.

Here we have the definition of a recursive method which returns the factorial of a number.

```ruby
    methods: {
      factorial: lambda do |input|
        number = input['number']
        if number > 1
          number * call('factorial', { number: number - 1 })
        else
          number
        end
      end
    }
```

```ruby
    actions: {
      factorial: {
        input_fields: lambda do
          [
            { name: "number", type: :integer }
          ]
        end,

        execute: lambda do |connection, input|
          { factorial: call(:factorial, { number: input['number'] }) }
        end
    },
```
