> Learn how removing the Ruby whitelist gives connector SDK developers full access to Ruby 2.7 methods, libraries, and pre-installed gems.

# Removal of Ruby whitelist for SDK

Following the migration of custom connector code execution to **isolated containers**, **Ruby whitelisting** is removed from the connector SDK. This change significantly expands the range of capabilities SDK developers can use within the platform. Developers can now leverage the **full functionality of Ruby 2.7**, including built-in libraries and Ruby gems available in the SDK container.

## Key capabilities

With the removal of Ruby whitelisting, developers can now access the full functionality of Ruby 2.7, including built-in libraries and Ruby gems available in the SDK container.

- **Access to Ruby 2.7 standard methods**
  
  Developers now have access to the full range of Ruby 2.7 standard methods. Developers can also use Ruby’s `require` method to import built-in libraries, such as JSON, CSV, socket, and others.
  
- **Pre-installed Ruby Gems**
  
  Developers can now directly use a selection of pre-installed Ruby gems without restrictions:
  
  - `activesupport` (5.2.8.1)
  - `aws-sigv4` (1.2.4)
  - `charlock_holmes` (0.7.7)
  - `concurrent-ruby` (1.2.3)
  - `gyoku` (1.3.1)
  - `i18n` (0.9.5)
  - `jwe` (1.1.1)
  - `jwt` (2.1.0)
  - `loofah` (2.21.3)
  - `mime-types` (3.5.2)
  - `nokogiri` (1.15.6)
  - `rails-html-sanitizer` (1.4.4)
  - `rest-client` (2.1.0)
  - `ruby_rncryptor` (3.0.2)
- **TCP sockets**
  
  Developers can now leverage TCP sockets for low-level TCP connections. [Learn more](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/socket/rdoc/TCPSocket.html).
  
  - Example use case: Implement MQTP protocol over UDP or WebSocket connections.
- **Classes and modules**
  
  Developers can now define classes and modules, improving code reusability, organization, and maintainability.
  
- **Dynamic code execution**
  
  Using the `eval` method, developers can now dynamically load and execute code. Code can be generated on the fly based on runtime data and executed immediately.
  
- **Multi-threaded and concurrent code**
  
  Developers can now write multi-threaded and concurrent code.
  

## Example connector ideas

- **E-commerce data scraper**
  
  A connector that uses `nokogiri` to scrape product data from various e-commerce websites, transforms the data using `gyoku`, and uploads it to a central database for analysis.
  
- **Secure API Gateway**
  
  A connector that uses `jwt` for secure API authentication and `rest-client` to interact with multiple third-party APIs, aggregating data and providing a unified interface.
  
- **Amazon S3 file manager**
  
  A connector that uses `aws-sigv4` to securely upload and download files from Amazon S3, with MIME type handling using `mime-types` to ensure correct file processing.
  
- **HTML sanitization**
  
  A connector that uses `loofah` and `rails-html-sanitizer` to sanitize HTML content, removing potentially harmful elements and ensuring data integrity.
  
- **Real-time data processor**
  
  A connector that uses `concurrent-ruby` to process multiple data streams in parallel, such as Internet of Things sensor data, performing real-time analysis and actions.
  
- **Concurrent processing**
  
  A connector that uses `concurrent-ruby` to handle concurrent tasks, improving the performance and responsiveness of connectors.
  
- **JWT authentication**
  
  A connector that uses the `jwt` gem to create and verify JSON web tokens for secure API authentication.
  
- **XML and HTML data handling**
  
  A connector that uses `nokogiri` and `gyoku` for parsing, transforming, and generating XML and HTML data. This can be useful for integrating with systems that use XML-based APIs or for web scraping tasks.
