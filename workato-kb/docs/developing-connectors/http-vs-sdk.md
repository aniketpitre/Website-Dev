> Compare the Workato HTTP connector and Connector SDK by authentication methods and data types to choose the right approach for your connector.

# HTTP connector and the Connector SDK

Workato provides the following options to enable you to build your own connector:

- **HTTP connector**: Allows you to make API requests using a visual interface
- **Connector SDK**: Provides programmatic control over connector behavior and advanced customization options

The Connector SDK supports advanced customization and works for users with development experience. You can use the [Connector Copilot](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/copilot) to generate code, explore examples, and streamline development.

This document describes the differences between these options and helps you determine the approach for your connector development.
