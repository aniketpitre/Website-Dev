# Customize the Approval bot accelerator for Slack

If you plan on implementing the **Approval bot accelerator** in Slack, you must configure the following recipes:

- [ABS | Call-006 | Slack Update Homepage](#update-homepage)
- [ABS | REC-001 | Slack Request Parent Recipe](#parent-recipe-modify)
- [ABS | REC-003 | Approve/Reject Request from Slack](#request-recipe-modify)

> **DEFAULT APPROVAL WORKFLOW**
> 
> The approval workflow in this accelerator triggers from a new/updated row in Google Sheets by default. If you decide to use an application other than Google Sheets as the basis of your approval workflow, you must also change the connection in the preceding recipes. Contact Customer Success for support.
