# BambooHR - 403 Forbidden errors

The BambooHR connector returns 403 errors when the connection lacks access to specific employee fields or data categories.

## Troubleshooting steps

Refer to the [403 Forbidden error](/en/troubleshooting/403-forbidden-error) troubleshooting guide to isolate the record that caused the error.

## Why 403 errors happen in BambooHR

Not all 403 errors result from missing access to individual fields. In many cases, BambooHR roles restrict access to entire sections of the employee profile, such as compensation, job information, or custom tabs, while still allowing access to the employee list.

These errors may also occur if the connected user lacks access to certain employee statuses, such as terminated or inactive employees, or to custom profile tabs that require additional permissions.

To resolve the issue, review the connected user's role in BambooHR and confirm they have access to all data types your recipe uses.
