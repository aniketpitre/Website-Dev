# General error codes

When a Workato recipe makes an API call that fails, the external service returns an HTTP error code. These codes appear in job reports and error handling datapills, and help you identify the cause of the failure.

This reference covers the most common HTTP error codes returned in Workato and links to guides that describe their causes and how to resolve them.

## Common HTTP error codes

The following table highlights the most frequently encountered HTTP error codes:

| Error code | Description |
