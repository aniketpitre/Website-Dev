# Build recipes in small steps

Workato recommends that you build and test recipes incrementally to isolate logic and identify errors early. This approach simplifies development and reduces debugging time.

## Use skip step to partially build recipes

You can mark a step as [skipped](/en/recipes/steps/skip-step) to instruct the recipe to bypass that step or block at runtime. Skipped steps don't run, and their datapills are unavailable for use in subsequent steps.

### When to use skip step

Use skip steps in the following situations:

| Objective | Scenario |
| --- | --- |
| Test a recipe incrementally | Build and test part of a recipe while leaving other steps unconfigured. Skip the incomplete steps to run and validate the logic you finished. |
| Compare logic paths | Try different methods to solve the same problem. Skip one branch of logic to focus on testing the other without deleting any steps. |
| Bypass faulty steps | Skip steps that return design-time errors, such as invalid connections, datapills, or missing configurations, to test the rest of the recipe without interruption. |
