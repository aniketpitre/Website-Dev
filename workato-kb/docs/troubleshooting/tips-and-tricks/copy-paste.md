# Copy paste steps

Copy and paste your recipe steps anywhere. Select any number of steps in a recipe to copy. Paste your copied steps anywhere within your recipe, or even into other recipes.

> Copy/paste is limited to the same workspace. You may not log out / log in to a different account between copy and pasting.

## Preserve order and prevent errors

Move entire sections of your recipe with multi-select copy/paste while preserving the order of each step.

This is critical in maintaining the logic of your recipes.

- The order for each step is preserved, ensuring that your are performing your workflow in the correct order.
- Recipe logic like [if-else conditionals](/en/features/if-conditions), [repeat loops](/en/recipes/steps#repeat-step), and [error monitoring blocks](/en/recipes/best-practices-error-handling) is maintained when pasting steps.
- [Formulas](/en/formulas/formula-mode) will also be pasted.

## Replicating app connection when pasting steps

When using copy/paste to duplicate steps in another recipe, the connection configuration is also copied to the target recipe. If the target recipe doesn't have an app connection, the app connection from the source recipe automatically connects.

If there is an existing app connection configured in the target recipe, the app connection does not change.

## Remap datapills and auto-suggestion

A side effect of copy-pasting steps is that some datapill mappings might be broken if their source actions are not copied together, resulting in invalid datapill mappings.

Each invalid datapill mapping is highlighted in the recipe editor upon pasting. You may select **Remap** to replace this datapill with one from the current recipe. Workato ensures that the datapill mapping uses the same app and action to provide the most relevant suggestions.

## Auto-remap datapills

If your action requires multiple remaps, Workato offers **auto-remap** to simplify the remapping process. Remap datapills in one go with intelligent matching suggestions.

1. Remap your first invalid datapill.

2. After you remapped your first invalid datapill, Workato checks for matching datapills for all the other invalid mappings. This is useful for actions with many datapill mappings, including NetSuite, Workday, and Salesforce.

3. Review the datapill suggestion and select **Accept all**.
