> Embed Workato into your product UI using full page and widget iframes to let customers build, manage, and monitor integrations.

# Embedding Workato implementation guide

Workato’s embedding options allow you to integrate powerful tools into your platform. This enables you to deliver a customized and seamless user experience for building, managing, and monitoring integrations.

You can embed Workato into your application's UI by constructing a direct link URL and embedding it within an `iframe`. Workato provides two types of `iframes` for this purpose:

## Full page iframes

Full page `iframes` enable you to embed any Workato page by specifying a direct URL path to the desired page within the `iframe`. This method enables you to display the page's content without the Workato navigation bar.

## Widget iframes

Widget `iframes` enable you to embed specific, function-focused widgets that integrate seamlessly into your application. You can choose from the following widget types:

### Connection widget

The connection widget allows you to securely collect credentials from your customers for any Workato connector directly within your product. Use this widget as part of a Managed Services offering or within a larger integration setup journey on your platform.

#### Error notifications in the connection widget

The connection widget displays the following notifications when specific issues occur:

- Connection lost
  
- Appears when the connection becomes invalid due to modified credentials or insufficient permissions. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and verify your connection credentials.  
  ![Connection lost](/assets/connection-lost._wzvHqXA.png)_Connection lost_
  
- Audit log replication connections
  
- Indicates that changes to the connection may affect the streaming of your audit log data.
  
- External secrets manager
  
- Indicates that changes to the connection may impact the use of secrets stored in your external provider.
  

#### Customize the connection widget

You can customize the connection widget to secure sensitive information, prevent changes to pre-configured settings, and pre-fill field values.

To apply these customizations, pass the `input_schema_ui_extensions` object when calling the [Create a connection](/en/oem/oem-api/connections#create-a-connection) or [Update a connection](/en/oem/oem-api/connections#update-a-connection) API. This schema lets you lock or hide fields, including nested properties. The widget applies these settings automatically during render.

The following example request demonstrates a customized connection configuration:

```shell
curl -X POST https://app.workato.com/api/managed_users/:managed_user_id/connections \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "provider": "databricks",
    "name": "My databricks connection",
    "folder_id": 147,
    "input": {
      "url": "http://oem.databricks.com",
      "password": "Testpwd1234",
      "profile": "Test Profile"
    },
    "input_schema_ui_extensions": {
      "url": {
        "locked": true
      },
      "password": {
        "hidden": true
      },
      "poolingx": {
        "properties": {
          "minSize": {
            "locked": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

  

> **SCHEMA RULES**
> 
> You can't lock or hide a required field if it doesn't have a value. For `array` fields, apply customization at the array level only. You can't apply different settings to individual array items.

After you create the connection, [embed the widget](#connection-widget-2) using the returned connection `id`. The widget renders with the customized field behavior defined in the connection.

### Recipe widget

The recipe widget enables you to embed a focused, streamlined view of an individual recipe page. This widget removes non-essential elements such as top navigation and side panels while preserving the core tabs for recipes, jobs, and versions, delivering a seamless build experience within your application.

### Dynamic field mapping widget

The dynamic field mapping feature lets you map fields from source systems to a destination step in a recipe without modifications to the core recipe logic. This widget provides a structured interface to manage field relationships inside embedded integrations.

## Embedding guidelines

Embedding full page and widget `iframes` follows the same implementation steps.

> **UNIQUE URL REQUIREMENTS**
> 
> Each type of `iframe` points to a unique URL depending on the content you embed.

Workato’s `iframes` enable you to embed your customers’ workspaces into your product’s UI, but embedding your admin workspace is not supported.

To reflect specific user permissions in an embedded iframe, include a [customer user ID](/en/oem/jwt-direct-linking#prerequisites) with a custom role in the JWT. This ensures the `iframe` adheres to the roles and permissions assigned to the user. For example, you can configure a user to view a recipe without being able to edit it. This approach enables you to provide a customized, permission-sensitive experience for each user.

This implementation guide includes the following sections:

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Construct a direct link URL](#construct-url)
- [Embed the URL in an iframe](#embed-url)
- [Communication between apps](#communication)
  - [Supported PostMessages for connection widget](#supported-postmessages-for-connection-widget)
  - [Workato Embedding Client](#workato-embedding-client)

> **CUSTOMIZATION**
> 
> Embedded supports customization, enabling you to customize Workato’s specific style properties using the [theme editor](/en/oem/branding) yourself. Available style changes include brand color, font, and margins.
> 
> Contact your Customer Success Representative for more extensive customization requests.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites before embedding Workato:

- JSON Web Token (JWT)
  
- _Required_. [Generate a JWT](/en/oem/jwt-direct-linking#step3) to facilitate secure access to connections in Workato. JWTs authenticate users and provide verified access to applications and resources.
  
- Origin
  
- _Required_. The origin URL (`<url_schema>`://`<url_host>`) is the default domain where you embed the Workato `iframe`. In specific cases, you must include the origin URL in the [JWT payload](/en/oem/jwt-direct-linking#prerequisites). This enables the parent window to receive messages through PostMessages API. Provide your Workato Success Representative with the origin URL. For example: `https://vendor.com`.
  
- Embedding URL prefix
  
- _Required for full page iframes_. Select an embedding path prefix for your URLs in the format `<embedding_url_prefix>`/`<workato_url>`. For example, if your prefix is `/integration` and the Workato URL is `/foo?a=1#hash`, your vendor URL is `/integration/foo?a=1#hash`.
  
- Workato path
  
- _Required_. Define the path to the Workato resource you plan to embed in your platform.
  
- Data center
  
- _Required_. Construct your direct link URL based on the data center hosting your Workato account. Refer to the [data center](/en/datacenter/datacenter-overview#supported-cloud-regions) page for more details.
  

## Construct a direct link URL

To embed Workato content, start by creating a direct link URL. The URL format varies based on the Data Center where your Workato account is hosted and the type of `iframe` you are embedding. Ensure to use the correct base URL for your data center.

### Base URLS by data center

The following base URLs correspond to each Workato Data Center. Choose the base URL that matches your data center location:

- **Workato accounts hosted in the US Data Center**: `https://app.workato.com`
- **Workato accounts hosted in the EU Data Center**: `https://app.eu.workato.com`
- **Workato accounts hosted in the JP Data Center**: `https://app.jp.workato.com`
- **Workato accounts hosted in the SG Data Center**: `https://app.sg.workato.com`
- **Workato accounts hosted in the AU Data Center**: `https://app.au.workato.com`
- **Workato accounts hosted in the IL Data Center**: `https://app.il.workato.com`
- **Workato accounts hosted in the CN Data Center**: `https://app.workatoapp.cn`
- **Workato accounts hosted in the KR Data Center**: `https://app.kr.workato.com`
- **Workato accounts hosted in the UK Data Center**: `https://app.uk.workato.com`

### Construct the URL by iframe type

After identifying the correct base URL, complete the URL structure for the specific `iframe` type using the following formats:

#### Full page iframe

Use the following URL structure to embed a full page:

```html
https://<base_url>/direct_link?workato_dl_path=<workato_path>&workato_dl_token=<jwt_token>
```

> **REPLACE PLACEHOLDER URL VALUES**
> 
> Replace the placeholders in the URL with the following:
> 
> - `<base_url>`: Use your specific [data center URL](#base-urls).
> - `<workato_path>`: Set this parameter to the path of the Workato page you plan to embed for that specific customer workspace. For example, `/?fid=19769006#assets`.
> - `<jwt_token>`: Use your JWT. Refer to the [Generate a JWT](/en/oem/jwt-direct-linking) page for more information.

#### Connection widget

Use the following URL structure to embed a connection widget:

```html
https://<base_url>/direct_link/embedded/connections/<connection_id>?workato_dl_token=<jwt_token>
```

> **REPLACE PLACEHOLDER URL VALUES**
> 
> Replace the placeholders in the URL with the following:
> 
> - `<base_url>`: Use your specific [data center URL](#base-urls).
> - `<connection_id>`: Set this parameter to the ID of the connection you plan to render for the specific customer workspace.
> - `<jwt_token>`: Use your JWT. Refer to the [Generate a JWT](/en/oem/jwt-direct-linking) page for more information.

#### Recipe widget

Use the following URL structure to embed a recipe widget:

```html
https://<base_url>/direct_link/embedded/recipes/<recipe_id>?workato_dl_token=<jwt_token>
```

> **REPLACE PLACEHOLDER URL VALUES**
> 
> Replace the placeholders in the URL with the following:
> 
> - `<base_url>`: Use your specific [data center URL](#base-urls).
> - `<recipe_id>`: Set this parameter to the ID of the recipe you plan to render for the specific customer workspace.
> - `<jwt_token>`: Use your JWT. Refer to the [Generate a JWT](/en/oem/jwt-direct-linking) page for more information.

#### Dynamic field mapping widget

Use the following URL structure to embed a dynamic field mapping widget:

```html
https://<base_url>/embedded/recipes/<recipe_id>/field_maps?workato_dl_token=<jwt_token>
```

> **REPLACE PLACEHOLDER URL VALUES**
> 
> Replace the placeholders in the URL with the following:
> 
> - `<base_url>`: Use your specific [data center URL](#base-urls).
> - `<recipe_id>`: Set this parameter to the ID of the recipe you plan to render for the specific customer workspace.
> - `<jwt_token>`: Use your JWT. Refer to the [Generate a JWT](/en/oem/jwt-direct-linking) page for more information.

## Embed the URL in an iframe

After you generate the correct direct link URL, embed the URL in an `iframe` in your application using the following format:

```html
<iframe src="https://<base_url>/direct_link?workato_dl_path=<workato_path>&workato_dl_token=<jwt_token>"></iframe>
```

## Communication between apps

The `iframe` and your partner application need to communicate securely to ensure smooth interactions. Workato uses the [PostMessage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) to facilitate cross-origin communication between your app and the embedded `iframe`.

Refer to the following message lists to implement or troubleshoot communication between your application and the `iframe`:

- View [EmbeddingWorkatoMessage](https://workato.github.io/full-embed-sample/types/EmbeddingMessages.EmbeddingWorkatoMessage.html) for the complete list of messages that Workato sends to your web app.
  
- View [EmbeddingVendorMessage](https://workato.github.io/full-embed-sample/types/EmbeddingMessages.EmbeddingVendorMessage.html) for the list of messages that your web app can send to Workato.
  

Use the [Workato Embedding Client](#workato-embedding-client) to streamline communication between your app and the embedded `iframe`. This client provides helper methods to send and receive messages efficiently.

> **EMBEDDING CLIENT LIMITATION**
> 
> The Workato Embedding Client currently only supports communication with Workato’s full page iframes, not widgets.

### Supported PostMessages for connection widget

Workato supports the following two PostMessages for the [connection widget](#connection-widget) only, enabling you to make dynamic adjustments and facilitate communication.

#### heightChange

The `heightChange` event adjusts the height of the content, allowing the `iframe` to resize to fit your UI.

> **LIMITATION**
> 
> We do not recommend using the `heightChange` event handler with full page `iframes`, as they are typically designed to span the full height of the browser window or `iframe`.

- **Payload**:
  
  ```json
  {
     "height": number
  }
  ```
  
- **Sample PostMessage**:
  
  ```json
  {
      "wk": true,
      "type": "heightChange",
      "payload": {
          "height": 467
      }
  }
  ```
  

#### connectionStatusChange

The `connectionStatusChange` event reports any changes in the connection status. You can use this event to trigger workflows, such as starting a recipe or calling external APIs, when the connection status updates.

- **Payload**:
  
  ```json
  {
    "id": number,
    "provider": string,
    "connected": boolean,
    "error": string
  }
  ```
  
- **Sample PostMessage**:
  
  ```json
  {
      "wk": true,
      "type": "connectionStatusChange",
      "payload": {
          "id": 453799,
          "provider": "google_drive",
          "connected": false
      }
  }
  ```
  

#### error

The `error` event reports an error message from the `iframe`.

- **Payload**:
  
  ```json
  {
    "message": string
  }
  ```
  
- **Sample PostMessage**:
  
  ```json
  {
    "wk": true,
    "type": "error",
    "payload": {
      "type": "FatalEmbeddingError",
      "message": "Fatal embedding error: sub_missing",
      "details": {
        "reason": "sub_missing"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  

### Example of supported PostMessages

The following example demonstrates how to handle and process supported PostMessages:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <script>
      window.addEventListener('message', receiveMessage);
      function receiveMessage(event) {
        var data = JSON.parse(event.data);

        switch (data.type) {
          case 'heightChange':
            document.getElementById('workatoId').style.height = data.payload.height + 'px';
            break;
          case 'connectionStatusChange':
            var message = data.error || (data.payload.connected ? 'Connected' : 'Disconnected');
            document.getElementById('statusId').innerText = message;
            break;
          case 'error':
            console.log(data.payload.message);
        }
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h4>Status: <span id="statusId"></span></h4>
    <iframe id="workatoId" src="https://www.workato.com/direct_link/embedded/connections/<connection_id>?workato_dl_token=<token>" style="width: 500px; height: 150px; border: 0"></iframe>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Workato Embedding Client

The `Workato Embedding Client` script enables streamlined communication between your web app and the embedded Workato platform. It provides helper methods to synchronize the embedded `iframe` and URLs seamlessly.

> **WORKATO EMBEDDING CLIENT SCRIPT REQUIRED BEFORE IFRAME**
> 
> Inject the Workato Embedding Client script before embedding any Workato full page `iframe`. Ensure the script loads synchronously so that a global Workato object is created, which you can then configure and use for helper methods.

Complete the following steps to insert the Workato Embedding Client into your web app:

1. Inject the following script on every page where you embed a full page Workato `iframe`:
   
   ```html
   <script src="https://embedding.workato.com/r/embedding-client.js">
   ```
   
   > **DATA CENTER**
   > 
   > Select the appropriate URL based on your Workato account’s data center. The data center identifier appears at the end of the URL before `.js`:
   > 
   > - Workato accounts hosted in the US Data Center: `https://embedding.workato.com/r/embedding-client.js`
   > - Workato accounts hosted in the EU Data Center: `https://embedding.workato.com/r/embedding-client-eu.js`
   > - Workato accounts hosted in the SG Data Center: `https://embedding.workato.com/r/embedding-client-sg.js`
   > - Workato accounts hosted in the JP Data Center: `https://embedding.workato.com/r/embedding-client-jp.js`
   > - Workato accounts hosted in the AU Data Center: `https://embedding.workato.com/r/embedding-client-au.js`
   > - Workato accounts hosted in the IL Data Center: `https://embedding.workato.com/r/embedding-client-il.js`
   > - Workato accounts hosted in the CN Data Center: `https://app.workatoapp.cn/r/embedding-client-cn.js`
   > - Workato accounts hosted in the KR Data Center: `https://embedding.workato.com/r/embedding-client-kr.js`
   > - Workato accounts hosted in the UK Data Center: `https://embedding.workato.com/r/embedding-client-uk.js`
   
   This script creates a global `Workato` object that is an instance of the `[[EmbeddingClient]]` class.
   
2. Insert the following configuration script after the Embedding Client script to set up your Workato integration:
   
   ```html
   <script>
     Workato.configure({
       // Value of `Embedding URL prefix` parameter
       embeddingUrlPrefix: '/integration'
     });
   </script>
   ```
   

> **BEST PRACTICE**
> 
> - Insert this script before embedding any Workato `iframe`.
> - Do not use `async` or `defer` attributes as the script loads synchronously.

#### Available methods

The Workato Embedding Client script enables you to use all properties and methods of the `EmbeddingClient` class, including the following key methods:

- handleNavigation
  
- Use the [handleNavigation](https://workato.github.io/full-embed-sample/classes/EmbeddingClient.EmbeddingClient.html#handleNavigation) method to synchronize the Workato URL in the embedded `iframe` with the partner web app's current URL.
  
- generateIframeURL
  
- Use the [generateIframeURL](https://workato.github.io/full-embed-sample/classes/EmbeddingClient.EmbeddingClient.html#generateIFrameUrl) method to generate a value for the `iframe`'s src attribute.
  

Refer to the [EmbeddingClient](https://workato.github.io/full-embed-sample/classes/EmbeddingClient.EmbeddingClient.html) documentation for additional helper methods.
