# Embedded API - Project grants

Use the following endpoints to manage a collaborator or group's [project grants](#what-are-project-grants) in an Embedded customer workspace.

> **API CLIENT ACCESS**
> 
> Project grant endpoints can only assign project roles to environments and projects that the API client can access. For example, an API client assigned to the `TEST` environment can only manage `TEST` projects. Additionally, if an API client is assigned to specific projects, it can only manage those projects. Refer to [Create a client role](/en/workato-api/api-clients#create-an-api-client) to configure an API client's access.

## Rate limits

The project grants resource has the following rate limit:

| Type | Resource | Quota |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All[](/en/oem/oem-api/project-grants.html) | All [Project grants](/en/oem/oem-api/project-grants.html) endpoints | 60 requests per minute |

## What are project grants?

A project grant assigns a [project role](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/access-control-v2#project-roles) to a collaborator or group. Refer to [Manage project access and roles](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/access-control-v2#manage-project-access-and-roles) to manage assigned project roles in the UI.

  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "bad_request",
      "title": "Assignment has already been taken"
