### Response

A successful request returns a `204 No Content` status code. The API deletes the project role and returns an empty response body.

400 BAD REQUEST

A `400 Bad Request` error indicates that the server couldn't process the request due to client-side issues. Common causes include malformed requests, invalid fields, or violations of field constraints, such as unsupported data types.

In the following example, the request fails because the role is still assigned to collaborators:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "bad_request",
      "title": "You can’t delete a role when collaborators are assigned to the role."
    }
  ]
}
```
