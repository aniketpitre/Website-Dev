> **RETRIEVE QUICKBOOKS REALM ID**
> 
> Retrieve your company's Quickbooks Realm ID using the [List connections](/en/oem/oem-api/connections#list-connections) API. Disconnect and reconnect your Quickbooks connection in Workato before calling the API to ensure the latest information is retrieved. The API returns the Realm ID in the `identity` field of the response, following your email address. In the preceding example, ACME's Realm ID is `1029384756102938`. For other connections, the identity field is returned as `null`.
> 
> Refer to the [SDK identity lambda documentation](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/connection/authorization#identity) for more details on setting up the `identity` field. The lambda’s output value is returned in the `identity` field of the list connections API.

## Create a connection

Creates a connection in a customer's account. This endpoint supports the following in customer workspaces:

- Adding a shell connection, OR
- Adding and authenticating a connection

> **OAUTH CONNECTIONS**
> 
> The Workato API allows you to create OAuth 2.0 connections. However, connections types that would normally redirect you to a sign-in screen, such as `oauth` or `oauth2_auth_code_grant`, require an `oauth_token_pair` object containing an access token and a refresh token. Client credentials grant connections don't require an `oauth_token_pair` object. You can create a shell connection in cases where you don't have an access token and refresh token.
> 
> Refer to the [Connection parameters reference](/en/oem/oem-api/connections-parameters#oauth-authentication) page for more information.
