> Reference for Embedded API endpoints to list and copy legacy custom roles in customer workspaces. Legacy roles are being replaced.

# Embedded API - Legacy roles

Use the following endpoints to manage legacy roles in an Embedded customer workspace.

Refer to the Developer API [Legacy roles](/en/workato-api/roles) documentation to manage legacy roles in the admin team.

> **LEGACY ROLES**
> 
> This page describes legacy roles. Workato is replacing legacy roles with the new permissions model, which uses environment roles and project roles. You can migrate legacy roles using the [Role migration API](/en/oem/oem-api/role-migration) or the [in-app migration wizard](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/migrate-roles). Refer to the [New permissions model](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/access-control-v2) documentation for more information.
> 
> After migration, these endpoints are deprecated. Refer to [RBAC 2.0 migration - Developer and Embedded API changes](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/rbac2-migration-api-changes) for the exact behavior.

## Rate limits

The roles resource has the following rate limit:

| Type | Resource | Quota |
