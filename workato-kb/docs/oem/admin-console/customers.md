> Use the Customers tab in the Embedded Admin console to view usage, add and manage customers, and access their workspaces and settings.

# Customers

The Customers tab is an essential tab within the Embedded Admin Console that gives partners a detailed look into usage and statistics within customer workspaces. Here, partners can view more details of each customer, add/remove and manage customers, and access their workspaces.

The following sections cover how to use the information provided in the customer tab to your advantage.

## Customer table

## Add a customer

There are two ways to add customers:

- Directly in the user interface
- Using a [Embedded platform API](/en/oem/oem-api/managed-users)

To add a customer in the Workato app:

1. Click the **\+ Add customer** button.
   
2. Enter the following information for the customer:
   
   - Customer name
   - Notification email
     - This email receives notifications for the events listed under **Workspace admin > Settings > Notifications**.
   - Plan
   - External ID (optional)

## Customer information

Individual customer information pages are available when you click a customer in the table. This page lets admins view the customer's dashboard and customer team collaborators. You can also change customer workspace settings.

### Customer dashboard

The dashboard displays the number of active recipes running and the success/error rates across the recipes. You can filter the recipes by **time period**.

## Collaborators

The Collaborators tab displays the team members in the account, including their names, emails, and roles. A unique tag identifies [Customer managers](/en/oem/admin-console/customer-managers).

![Embedded: Customer collabs](/assets/customer-team.mx6_Zjec.png)_Customer team collaborators_

### Switching to customer workspaces

To access a customer's account, [customer managers](/en/oem/admin-console/customer-managers) and collaborators of the customer's workspace can select the **Switch to this account** button on the top right of the page.

If additional team members require access to the workspace, you can manually add them to the team while in the customer workspace.

* * *

## Settings

The Settings tab controls the configuration for the customer's account, including:

- [Plan](#plan)
- [App access](#app-access)
- [External ID](#external-id)
- [`iframe` origin URL](#iframe-origin-url) (for Embedded/Embedded connection widget only)
- [Account deletion](#delete-account)

> **Updating customer name**
> 
> To update a customer's name, navigate to the Customer's workspace to edit the workspace name. Learn more about how to [update a customer name](#update-customer-name).

### Plan

Complete the following steps to change a customer's plan or trial status:

1. Go to **Manage customers**.
   
2. Select the customer you plan to update.
   
3. Go to **Settings > Plan**.
   
   ![The Customer > Settings > Plan tab](/assets/customer-settings.8cDoJwjV.png)_The **Customer > Settings > Plan** tab_
   
4. Configure plan settings for the workspace:
   
   - Use the **Plan** drop-down menu to select an existing plan. Contact your Customer Success Manager to add or remove plans.
     
   - Click the **Enable trial** toggle to put a new customer workspace on a temporary plan with 100 jobs allocated. You can only enable trial plans for workspaces that are less than 5 days old. If enabled, trial plans automatically expire 30 days after the workspace is created. When a trial plan expires, the workspace returns to the plan assigned during setup.
     

### App access

Customers you create can access all available apps by default. You can select the apps a customer can access in the **App access** tab.

Customers can only discover and connect to the apps you selected. This also applies to apps in the [Community Library](/en/oem/oem-community).

Complete the following steps to modify the list of available apps for a customer:

1. Open the customer's **Settings > App access** tab in your partner account.
   
2. Click the **Edit** button in the **App access** tab.
   
3. Select the apps you plan to allow the customer to access.
   
4. Click **Apply changes**.
   

> **Adding apps**
> 
> You must manually add new apps to the accessible apps list to grant the customer access after selecting apps.

### External ID

The external ID is a customer ID assigned to the customer by the Embedded partner. This ID usually corresponds to a customer ID within your CRM. You can change the value anytime, but doing so affects any [APIs](/en/oem/oem-api/managed-users) using the external ID as an input.

Additionally, Workato assigns each customer a unique customer workspace ID. This ID appears in the URL of the **Customer Information** page:

`https://app.workato.com/admin_console/customers/4676/dashboard`

In this example, the **customer workspace ID** is `4676`.

### `iframe` origin URL

Entering a URL into the `iframe` origin URL field appends the value set in the Embedded partner admin account.

Consider a situation where an Embedded partner workspace has an origin URL of `https://company.com`. If you don't configure an origin URL in the customer workspace, the customer inherits the origin from the partner account.

If the customer has a unique domain they log in with, for example, `https://customer.company.com`, you can use the **iframe origin URL** setting to define and apply this only to that specific customer.

If your application supports multiple custom domains or workspaces, this setting enables those features.

> **Feature availability**
> 
> The **iframe origin URL** setting is available only for customers using [Embedded](/en/oem/workato-embedded).

#### Multiple origins per customer

In addition to setting customer-specific origin URLs, you can define multiple origins per customer.

In the **iframe origin URL** field, enter a list of URLs separated by commas. For example:

```
https://na1.company.com,https://eu1.company.com,https://na2.company.com
```

When defined, the origins should be provided as `origin` after generating the JWT. After the user signs in using the JWT, the provided origin is saved into the session object and used for the session's lifetime until the user signs out. For more info about JWT direct linking, refer to this [guide](/en/oem/jwt-direct-linking).

### Delete account

The Embedded partner may delete a customer at any time. Deleting a customer is permanent and removes all data and recipes associated with the account. You cannot recover deleted customers.

## Update customer name

To update a customer name, you must first switch to the customer workspace.

> **Required privileges**
> 
> Only customer managers with [Collaborator privileges](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/privileges-reference#workspace-access) are allowed to update the customer name.

1. Select the customer to update from the [Customer table](#customer-table) > Click on **Switch to this account** located on the top right.

2. Log in to the customer workspace and navigate to **Workspace admin** on the left side navigation bar.
   
3. In the **Settings** tab, you will be able to update the Team name.
