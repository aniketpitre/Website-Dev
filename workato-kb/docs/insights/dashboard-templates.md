> Learn about Insights dashboard templates, including the workspace overview, project overview, and blank templates for building dashboards.

# Dashboard templates

Insights is designed to provide you with an overview of your automations' functionality out of the box and provides templates pre-configured with queries to give you insights into your workspace and projects. Dashboard templates are available from the Insights homepage when you [create a new dashboard](/en/insights/workspace-dashboards).

Insights has the following dashboard templates:

- [Workspace overview template](/en/insights/dashboards#workspace-overview)
- [Project overview template](/en/insights/dashboards#project-overview)

Alternatively, you can start with a blank template to build your dashboard from scratch:

- [Blank template](#blank-template)

Refer to the [usage inspiration](/en/insights/usage-inspiration) section of our documentation for examples of the custom dashboards you can build.
