> Create a simple dashboard showing active recipes in your workspace using either the report builder or query builder.

# Build your first dashboard

In this walkthrough, you'll build a workspace activity overview with three at-a-glance metrics and a breakdown of your most active projects.

![Example dashboard showing active recipes](/assets/first-dashboard-complete.Cv-h46rZ.png)_Example: Active recipes dashboard_

## Before you start

This walkthrough assumes your workspace has some recipes running. If you're new to Workato, [create your first recipe](/en/getting-started/build-first-recipe) first, then return here.

Follow the **Report builder** or **Query builder** tabs throughout. The query builder requires more manual configuration: you'll build filter conditions, summarize data, and sort results for each chart.

> **PRIVATE BETA**
> 
> The report builder is in private beta. Private beta features are available by invite only. Contact your Customer Success Manager to enable this feature.
> 
> Workato may update feature functionality or change availability without prior notice during the private beta.

## Create a new dashboard

Complete the following steps to create your dashboard:

1. Go to **Platform > Insights** and select **Create dashboard**.
   
   ![Create new dashboard](/assets/create-dashboard.CyVefYA4.png)_Create a new dashboard_
   
2. Name your dashboard `Workspace activity` and select the **Blank** template.
   
   ![Name and select template](/assets/name-dashboard.BkLtDtFz.png)_Name your dashboard_
   
   > **DASHBOARD TEMPLATES**
   > 
   > The **Blank** template lets you build a dashboard from scratch. [Dashboard templates](/en/insights/dashboard-templates) are also available for common workspace and project views.
   
3. Click **Create dashboard** to open the dashboard editor.
   

### About the dashboard editor

The dashboard editor has [four main areas](/en/insights/navigate#dashboard-editor):

- **Components panel**: contains the components you can add to your dashboard, including containers, text, dividers, and chart components.
- **Dashboard canvas**: the area your viewers see. Drag components here to build your layout.
- **Editor panel**: contains buttons to preview, save, and exit the dashboard.
- **Component properties panel**: appears when you select a component, letting you configure it.

Clicking **Edit** on a chart component opens the chart editor, where you set up the data query and choose how to display the results.

The components panel looks different depending on whether you have report builder access:

**Report builder**

![Dashboard editor with Report builder](/assets/dashboard-editor-v2.pKFt99_J.png)_Dashboard editor with Report builder: the components panel shows specific chart types (KPI, Table, Bar, and others) along with a Filter group option_

**Query builder**

![Dashboard editor with Query builder](/assets/dashboard-editor-v1.BqKTi-tp.png)_Dashboard editor with Query builder: the components panel shows a generic Chart component and a Filter group option_

## Set up your layout

Complete the following steps to set up your layout:

1. Clear the existing charts from the canvas by selecting each component and clicking **Delete**.
   
2. Drag chart components from the components panel onto the canvas:
   
   **Report builder**
   
   - 3 **KPI** chart components
   - 1 **Table** chart component
   
   **Query builder**
   
   - 4 **Chart** components
   
3. Drag chart edges and corners to resize and arrange the charts.
   
   **Report builder**

   **Query builder**
   
   ![Dashboard with three Chart components across the top row and one Chart spanning the full width below](/assets/layout-setup-query-builder.Cgcn3_ay.png)_Target layout: three charts on the top row, one chart spanning full width below_
   
     
   
   > **DISPLAY COMPONENTS**
   > 
   > Add **Container** and **Text block** components to provide context and help viewers understand what each chart represents. Use headings and descriptions to add background.
   

## Configure your charts

Select a chart on the canvas and click **Edit** to open the chart editor. The **Report builder** lets you pick a pre-built metric with minimal configuration. The **Query builder** requires you to build the query yourself step by step.

> **QUERY BUILDER PATTERN**
> 
> Each chart in the query builder follows the same pattern:
> 
> - Select a **data source**
> - Add **Filter** steps to narrow the data
> - Add a **Summarize** step to aggregate it into a metric
> - Configure **Chart settings** to choose how it's displayed
> 
> The results table updates after each step so you can see what your query returns.

### Chart 1: Active recipes

This KPI chart shows how many recipes are currently running in your workspace. Use this to verify that your automations are running as expected.
