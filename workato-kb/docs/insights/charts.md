# Chart types

![Chart editor](/assets/insights-pie-graph-setup.DLr9X1fr.png)_Chart editor_

You can create custom charts with your data after you've chosen a [data source](/en/insights/data-sources) and prepared it by performing [queries](/en/insights/queries). Visualizing your data involves determining the metrics and dimensions you plan to represent.

- **Metric**: Quantitative values that you plan to analyze, track, and present visually. Metrics can be aggregated to find the sum, average, or count. It's typically the key performance indicator (KPI) or main value you plan to report on.
- **Dimension**: Categorical variables that give context or descriptive information to the metrics in your report. Dimensions are used for slicing, grouping, and filtering data.

For example, you might plan to analyze the number of successful and failed jobs (metric) by Environment (dimension). You can use the Environment dimension to determine if integrations are performing well in your DEV, TEST, or PROD environments. Similarly, you can analyze money saved (metric) by project (dimension) to understand which projects are saving you the most money.

Insights displays your data as a table by default. You can use the **Type** drop-down menu to select a chart and customize it. Insights supports the following chart types for data visualizations:

- [Table](#table)
- [Line graph](#line-graph)
- [Area graph](#area-graph)
- [Bar graph](#bar-graph)
- [Pie chart](#pie-chart)
- [KPI chart](#kpi-chart)

## Table

Tables are a structured way to present organized information with rows and columns. They are particularly useful when presenting data with multiple dimensions, comparisons, or detailed information.

For example, the following table contains data for all business processes and provides detailed, exact data on the cost for each workflow run.

By default, Insights displays your data as a table. To customize this table, configure the following input fields:

- Title
  
- Name your chart. The name you enter here displays on your Insights dashboard.
  
- Displayed columns
  
- Select the columns you plan to display in your chart. Click **Select all** to select/deselect all columns for display or select columns individually. Reorganize your columns by dragging and dropping them into place. This output is dynamic and depends on the **data source** you select. See [Data sources](/en/insights/data-sources) for a description of the data available, organized by source.

## Line graph

Line graphs are suited for displaying trends and changes over time. They are particularly effective at illustrating how a variable or multiple variables change in relation to each other as time progresses.

**Visualize request volume**

The following line graph represents the number of onboarding requests an HR team receives each day.

## Area graph

Area graphs are useful for displaying quantitative data over time, typically illustrating how values change in relation to one another. They are particularly suited to displaying trends, such as task consumption over time.

**Visualize task consumption**

The following area graph displays cumulative task consumption for the past 365 days. ![Area graph](/assets/insights-area-setup.CUMuy9kA.png)_Use an area graph to visualize task consumption_

**Customize colors**
