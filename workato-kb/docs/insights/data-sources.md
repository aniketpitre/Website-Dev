> Learn about Insights data sources that pull from your workspace, including projects, recipes, job history, data tables, and workflow apps.

# Data sources

Data sources pull from a specific part of your workspace, such as the project catalog, job history, or data tables. The data sources available to you depend on your role and permissions in the workspace. For example, you can only see [data tables](/en/data-tables) in the projects you can access. Refer to [Manage roles and privileges](/en/insights/permissions) for more information.

## Query builder

The following table describes the type of data available for each data source.

| Data source | Description | Available data |

This additional data depends on the [columns](/en/data-tables/user-interface/column-types.html) present in your workflow app's corresponding [data table](/en/data-tables.html). |

## Report builder

The report builder uses prebuilt metrics and dimensions to populate charts.

![Data sources](/assets/insights-data-source-report-builder.BqDkbWRF.png)_Select a data source_

The report builder offers metrics and dimensions for a range of reporting needs. Choose the area that matches the question you're answering:

- **Automation health**: Job success and failure rates, active recipes, and unused recipes (active but not processing jobs). Refer to [Integrations](#integrations).
- **API traffic and governance**: Request volume, latency, failure rates, or inactive clients. Refer to [APIs](#apis).
- **Workspace activity**: Who joined, which connections changed, or when recipes were created and modified. Refer to [Audit and governance](#audit-governance).
- **Platform consumption and chargeback**: Credits, business actions, or API calls a team or process consumes. Refer to [Usage](#usage).

The available metrics and dimensions are the same across all chart types, but the terminology varies:

| Chart type | Metric label | Dimension label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Line, Bar, Area | Y-axis | X-axis |
| Pie | Metric | Dimension |
| Table | Metrics | Dimensions |
| KPI | Metric | — |

> **COMPATIBLE METRICS AND DIMENSIONS**
> 
> Metrics and dimensions aren't all interchangeable. Workato filters the list of dimensions to show only compatible options when you select a metric, and does the same when you select a dimension. For example, **Job status** is available when reporting on jobs, but not when reporting on collaborators.

> **PRIVATE BETA**
> 
> The report builder is in private beta. Private beta features are available by invite only. Contact your Customer Success Manager to enable this feature.
> 
> Workato may update feature functionality or change availability without prior notice during the private beta.

This reference groups the available metrics and dimensions into four reporting areas. Each area lists the metrics you can measure and the dimensions you can group and filter by.

> **DATA RETENTION**
> 
> The report builder currently retains data for a limited window:
> 
> - **Integrations**, **APIs**, and **Audit and governance** report on up to the last 365 days.
> - **Usage** reports on the current active accounting period only.

### Integrations

Measure the health of your recipes and jobs.

#### Metrics

| Metric | Category | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active recipes | Recipe | The number of active recipes in the workspace. |
| Active projects | Recipe | The number of unique projects that contain at least one active recipe. |
| Unused recipes | Recipe | The number of active recipes that didn't process any jobs in the last 30 days. |
| Recipe success rate | Recipe | The proportion of jobs that completed successfully, as a ratio of successful jobs to total jobs. |
| Recipe failure rate | Recipe | The proportion of jobs that failed, as a ratio of failed jobs to total jobs. |
| Total jobs | Job | The total number of jobs that started during the selected time period and have since completed, regardless of outcome. |
| Successful jobs | Job | The total number of jobs that completed successfully. |
| Failed jobs | Job | The total number of jobs that failed. |
| Jobs tasks | Job | The number of task steps executed across jobs. Use `SUM` for total task consumption or `AVG` to understand recipe complexity. _This metric will be moved to the usage dataset in the future_. |
| Jobs duration | Job | The total execution duration of jobs, in milliseconds. |

> **METRICS WITHOUT A TIME AXIS**
> 
> **Active recipes**, **Active projects**, and **Unused recipes** report the current state of your workspace, so you can't add the **Date** dimension to chart them over time.

> **RATE METRICS**
> 
> **Recipe success rate** and **Recipe failure rate** return a ratio, such as 0.94. Use the chart's number formatting to display it as a percentage.

> **ABOUT THE DATE DIMENSION**
> 
> Use the **Date** dimension to add a time axis to metrics that measure activity over a time period. Workato automatically maps it to the correct time column for each metric, so it works consistently across any metric.

### APIs

This section provides visibility into your API Platform through two types of metrics:

- **Inventory**: Current counts of configured API Platform resources, including access profiles, clients, collections, and endpoints.
