> Calculated columns enable you to perform basic data manipulations and transformations within the dashboard.

# Calculated columns

The calculated columns feature enables you to create calculated columns within Insights dashboards. This allows you to perform custom data manipulations directly within the dashboard environment and eliminates the need for recipe-driven data processing. Calculated columns support [arithmetic, comparison, and logical](/en/insights/operators) operators and numerous built-in [datetime](/en/insights/datetime-functions), [mathematical](/en/insights/math-functions), and [string](/en/insights/string-functions) functions. This enables you to calculate date differences, report on calculated columns you define, manipulate strings, and more without leaving your Insights dashboards.

## How to create calculated columns

Creating a calculated column in Insights follows a similar process to other data manipulations. You can begin with an existing dashboard or create a new one and add calculated columns using the query builder. Calculated columns can be used on their own or combined with other queries to help you extract the specific information you require.

![Query builder](/assets/insights-queries.pnyT96qh.png)_Build a calculated column in the query builder_

## Supported operators and functions

Calculated columns support the following operators and functions:

- [Operators](/en/insights/operators): Use arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators to manipulate your data.
- [Datetime functions](/en/insights/datetime-functions): Extract, modify, and calculate time-based values.
- [Mathematical functions](/en/insights/math-functions): Round and manipulate numerical values.
- [String functions](/en/insights/string-functions): Manipulate, format, and analyze text-based values.

## Example use case: Resume screening automation

This use case illustrates how to create a series of calculated columns to track and report on an automated resume screening process. In this example, we log all activities related to this workflow in a data table called `Resume screening`, and capture key details such as ticket IDs, statuses, start dates, and more. All calculated columns in our dashboard rely on this underlying data source.

**Underlying data source**

![Data table](/assets/data-table.0KyksEuQ.png)_The `Resume screening` data table is the underlying data source_

This example use case includes instructions on how to create calculated columns that accomplish the following tasks:

- [Report total time saved in hours](#time-report)
- [Convert currency](#currency-convert)
- [Get open vs. resolved tickets as a ratio](#tickets-get)
- [Show new tickets per quarter](#tickets-new-show)
- [Transform text](#text-transform)

### Getting started

The following steps are common to all calculated columns created in this use case. Complete these steps to get started:

1. Go to **Platform > Insights**. Create a new dashboard or select one of your existing dashboards.
   
2. Add a new chart component to your dashboard and click **Edit chart data**.
   
3. Select a data source
   
   Select the event data source you plan to report on. Our example reports on the time saved from an automated resume screening process, which we capture in a data table.
   
   1. In the **Use data from** field, select `Data tables` as the **Source type** and `Resume screening` as the **Data source**.

### Get resolution rate as a percentage

This example demonstrates how to get a resolution rate as a percentage. In this example, we are interested in reporting on the efficiency of our resume screening process as it relates to our effectiveness in filling positions. To accomplish this, we track each position in a data table, where tickets with the `closed` status are filled and tickets with the `new` status are open.

Complete the following steps to create a calculated column that displays the ticket resolution rate as a percentage:

1. Click **+** (plus) and select the **Summarize** step.
   
   ![Available queries](/assets/insights-queries.pnyT96qh.png)_Select **Summarize**_
   
2. Configure the summarize step to get a count of rows
   
   1. Select `Count of rows` from the **Metrics** drop-down.
      
   2. Select `Status` from the **Data column** drop-down.
      
   3. Preview your data in the **Results table**. This table displays the number of closed and open tickets.
      
      ![Preview results table](/assets/percentage-summarize.BkqMgmNB.png)_Preview your data in the **Results table**_
      
   
3. Click **+** (plus) and select the **Summarize** step.
   
   ![Available queries](/assets/insights-queries.pnyT96qh.png)_Select **Summarize**_
   
4. Configure the Summarize step to obtain the minimum, maximum, and cumulative row count
   
   **_This step operates under the assumption that there are fewer resolved tickets than open tickets. If the contrary is true for your use case, adjust the logic accordingly. You can view the distribution of statuses in the results table of the preceding step._**
   
   1. Select `Min of` from the **Metrics** drop-down and `Count of rows` from the **Data column** drop-down. This step counts the number of resolved tickets (tickets with the `closed` status).
      
   2. Click **\+ New metric**.
      
   3. Select `Max of` from the **Metrics** drop-down and `Count of rows` from the **Data column** drop-down. This step counts the number of open tickets (tickets with the `new` status).
      
   4. Click **\+ New metric**.
      
   5. Select `Cumulative sum of` from the **Metrics** drop-down and `Count of rows` from the **Data column** drop-down. This step adds the number of open and closed tickets together to obtain the total number of tickets.
      
   6. Preview your data in the **Results table**. This table displays the number of closed, open, and total tickets.
      
      ![Preview results table](/assets/percentage-summarize-2.4JAs0Xl4.png)_Preview your data in the **Results table**_
      
   
5. Click **+** (plus) and select the **Calculated column** step.
   
6. Configure the calculated column to calculate the percentage of resolved tickets
   
   1. Provide a **Column name**, such as `Percentage`.
      
   2. Select the `round` function, divide the number of closed tickets (Min of Count of rows) by the number of total tickets (Cumulative count of rows), and multiply the result by 100.
      
      **Column expression** (required):
      
      \= `round(`{{Min of Count of rows}}`/`{{Cumulative count of rows}}`*100, 1)`
      
   3. Preview your data in the **Results table**. This table displays the number of resolved tickets as a percentage.

7. Visualize your data
   
   1. Select `KPI` from the **Type** drop-down.
      
   2. Select `Percentage` from the **Data column** drop-down.
      
   3. Optionally, provide a unique label for this chart, such as `% Placement rate`. When you leave this field blank, the label is the column name you selected in the previous step.
      
   4. Click **Save to page** to save the chart to your dashboard.

### Show new tickets per quarter (custom date unit)

Calculated columns enable you to create custom date units, allowing you to track business events quarterly, regardless of when your fiscal year begins (January, February, or March).

Complete the following steps to create a calculated column that displays new tickets per quarter:

1. Click **+** (plus) and select the **Calculated column** query.
   
   ![Available queries](/assets/insights-queries.pnyT96qh.png)_Select **Calculated column**_
   
2. Configure the calculated column
   
   1. Provide a unique name for the new calculated column, such as `Quarter`.
      
   2. Select the `floor` and `month` function and map in the Created at datapill. This expression extracts the month from the date the ticket was created, rounds the input down, and divides the result to determine the quarter.
      
      **Column expression** (required):
      
      \= `floor((month(`{{Created at}}`)-2+12)/3%4)+1`
      
   3. Preview your data in the **Results table**. This table displays the quarter in which each ticket was created.
