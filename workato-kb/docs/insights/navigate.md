> Learn how to navigate Insights through its three main interfaces: the homepage, the dashboard editor, and the chart editor.

# Navigate Insights

Insights has three main interfaces: the Insights homepage, the dashboard editor, and the chart editor.

- [Insights homepage](#insights-homepage): The central hub for managing your dashboards. View, rename, download, create, and delete dashboards from this page.
- [Dashboard editor](#dashboard-editor): Add charts and filter groups to your dashboard, and customize its appearance with text blocks, containers, and dividers.
- [Chart editor](#chart-editor): Build and edit charts by defining your data source, calculated fields, and display formats.

## Insights homepage

The Insights homepage is where you manage all your dashboards.

Use the dashboard tabs to switch between dashboards, create new dashboards, or clone, rename, and delete existing dashboards. Click **Edit dashboard** to open the dashboard editor.

You can also [download a dashboard](/en/insights/view-dashboards#download-a-dashboard) as an image. Note that downloaded images don't include the underlying dataset.

## Dashboard editor

The dashboard editor is where you build and arrange your dashboard.

![Dashboard editor](/assets/dashboard-editor-annotated-2.DnWYhY1l.png)_Dashboard editor_

The dashboard editor has four main areas:

- **Components panel**: Contains all available components, organized into two types:
  - **Dashboard components** (**Chart**, **Filter group**) display and filter your data.
  - **Display components** (**Text block**, **Container**, **Divider**) control the visual appearance of your dashboard.
- **Dashboard canvas**: The area that displays to your end users. Click a component to edit, resize, arrange, or delete it.
- **Editor panel**: Use **Editor** and **Preview** to switch modes. Click **Save** to save your dashboard, and **Exit** to return to the homepage.
- **Component properties panel**: Customize the selected component. Select a **Display** component to edit its style, a **Filter group** to configure filters, or a **Chart** to edit chart data or clone and delete it.

> **REPORT BUILDER**
> 
> The **Dashboard** section of the components panel displays specific chart types such as **Bar**, **Pie**, and **Line** instead of a single **Chart** component for users with [report builder](#report-builder) access.
>

## Chart editor

The chart editor is where you build and configure charts for your dashboard. Insights provides two chart editors: the [report builder](#report-builder) and the [query builder](#query-builder). Refer to [Concepts](/en/insights/concepts#chart) for the difference between the two and when to use each.

You can open the chart editor in the following ways:

- Click an unconfigured chart.
- Select a chart and click the **Edit** icon.
- Select a chart and click **Edit chart data** in the component properties panel.

### Report builder

The report builder is a streamlined interface for building charts from a single data source. You can access it by dragging a chart type, such as **Bar**, **Pie**, **Line**, **Area**, **KPI**, or **Table**, onto your dashboard canvas.

> **PRIVATE BETA**
> 
> The report builder is in private beta. Private beta features are available by invite only. Contact your Customer Success Manager to enable this feature.
> 
> Workato may update feature functionality or change availability without prior notice during the private beta.

![Report builder](/assets/chart-editor-report-builder.o0TFpO7P.png)_The report builder. This example shows active recipes by environment._

The report builder has three main areas:

- **Setup panel**: Configure your chart data and appearance. Use it to:
  - Select metrics and dimensions
  - Add optional filters and sort
  - Customize formats and labels
- **Chart canvas**: Displays a live preview of your chart. Updates automatically as you adjust settings.
- **Results table**: Shows the data behind your chart. Use it to confirm your filters are returning the expected results.

Click **Save to page** to save your chart. Click **Exit** to return to the dashboard editor.

> **REQUIRED DATA**
> 
> You can't save a chart until you select the data it requires. Each chart type needs a different combination, but most require at least one metric and one dimension.

> **SWITCHING EDITORS**
> 
> You can't switch to the query builder for an existing report builder chart. Drag **Chart (Custom Query)** onto your canvas to use the query builder.

### Query builder

The query builder is a step-by-step interface for complex data transformations. You can access it by dragging the **Chart** component onto your dashboard canvas, or **Chart (Custom Query)** if you have [report builder](#report-builder) access.

![Query builder](/assets/chart-editor-query-builder-1.m9ccgaBx.png)_The query builder. This example returns unused recipes, or active recipes that didn't process any jobs since the start of the year._

The query builder has four main areas:

- **Data query**: Select a [data source](/en/insights/data-sources) and build your query using steps, such as Filter, Summarize, Join, Sort, Row limit, and Calculated column. Refer to [Query components](/en/insights/queries) for a full reference.
- **Chart preview and settings**: Displays a live preview of your chart and lets you configure how it appears. Options include:
  - Chart type and chart data
  - Chart title and axis labels
  - Chart colors
  - (For table widgets) Column order
- **Results table**: Shows the output of your query. Updates after each query step so you can verify your transformations as you build.

Click **Save** to save your chart. Click **Exit** to return to the dashboard editor.

> **SAVE AT DASHBOARD LEVEL**
> 
> Saving a chart doesn't save the dashboard. After saving your chart, return to the dashboard editor and click **Save** to apply your changes.
