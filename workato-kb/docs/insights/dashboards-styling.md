## Best practices for dashboard design

Follow these best practices to design dashboards that are both functional and easy to read:

- Give your dashboard meaningful titles, headings, and chart labels so your audience immediately understands what they're looking at. For example, label a metric `Number of jobs` instead of the default `Count of Rows`.
- Use color to convey meaning so your dashboard is intuitive. For example, use green for successful jobs and red for failures.
- Group related charts in containers, and use dividers and padding to separate components and reduce visual clutter. For example, group high-level job and recipe metrics in one container and usage data in another.
- Apply [filters](/en/insights/filter-groups) at the dashboard or container level so your audience can focus on a specific project, recipe, or date range.
