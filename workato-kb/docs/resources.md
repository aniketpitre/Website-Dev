> Learn how Workato resources let you define common files once, including XSD, XSLT, and WSDL, and reference them across recipes.

# Resources

Resources are assets you can define once and reference across multiple recipes and files. Use resources as a single source of truth for common files, including XSD, XSLT, WSDL, Ruby, JavaScript, Python, and WEL files.

Resources provide the following additional benefits:

- **Version management**: Workato retains the last 100 versions of a resource in the [Versions](/en/resources/resource-management#versioning) tab. You can download and re-upload a previous version to [restore it](/en/resources/resource-management#restore-a-resource-version).
  
- **Security**: Workato parses resources without resolving external references. This protects your environment from potential vulnerabilities. Workato also scans uploaded files for threats and blocks malicious files from view or use.
  
- **Automatic updates**: Recipes automatically update to use the newest version of a resource after it passes security checks.
  

> **RESOURCES ARE LIVE REFERENCES**
> 
> Resource references store static paths to files and resolve the paths at runtime, so changes to a resource's active version or availability immediately affect the assets that consume it.

Refer to the following pages to get started with resources:

- [Recipe integration](/en/resources/recipe-integration): Use a resource as a data source in supported recipe actions.
- [Resource management](/en/resources/resource-management): Upload, view, update, download, delete, move, and version resources using the Workato UI.
- [Resources API](/en/workato-api/static-assets): Manage resources programmatically.
