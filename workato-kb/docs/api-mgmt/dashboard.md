> Use the Workato API platform dashboard to monitor endpoints and collections, track requests, errors, and policy violations in real time.

# API Platform dashboard

The API platform dashboard allows owners of the API platform to visualize real-time data pertaining to the endpoints and API collections at a glance.

Monitor the performance of your API platform as a whole, or get granular data about a specific endpoint collection or requesting customer.

**Successful request** and **Errors** provide a big picture view of the health of your API endpoints.

Use the **Policy violations** metric to identify key clients or collections that produce abnormal API calls. See here for more information on [API Access Policies](/en/api-mgmt/api-access-policies).

## Filters

Use filter parameters to adjust the API dashboard view. The dashboard shows data for the last 30 days, all clients, and all collections by default. You can change the filters to find your preferred dashboard view. Filters reset after you leave the page.

You can filter dashboard results by the following:

- **Period**: Choose a time window such as the last 30 days or a custom range.
- **Status**: Filter based on API request status.
- **Clients**: View metrics for one or more API clients.
- **Gateway**: Select either **Cloud** or **Edge** to filter traffic routed through specific gateways. The **Collections** filter shows only API proxy collections deployed to edge gateways when you select **Edge**.
- **Collections**: Narrow results by specific API collections or endpoints.

## API Activity

The **API Activity** graph summarizes all API requests processed. This visualization helps identify trends, spikes, or drops in API usage, highlighting periods of high activity or potential issues with your API.

## Peak concurrent API requests

The **Peak concurrent API requests** graph summarizes the peak number of API requests that were processed simultaneously. The height of the bars indicates the number of concurrent requests at the highest points of activity.

This section enables you to understand the API load at any given time. It helps identify peak usage times, which can be important for capacity planning and ensuring the infrastructure can handle high loads without performance degradation.

## Top request count

The **Top clients by request count** and **Top endpoints by request count** graphs visualize your most active API consumers and most popular endpoints. This display changes according to your selected [filters](/en/api-mgmt/dashboard#filters).

To see details of each endpoint request, navigate to the **Logs** tab.
