# API platform by Workato - New API request trigger

The **New API request** trigger defines the request and response structure for a [recipe endpoint](/en/api-mgmt/api-recipes/) and creates a job when it receives an API request.

> **ACCESS REQUIREMENTS**
> 
> API recipes require access to the [API Platform](/en/api-management) feature. Contact your Customer Success Manager if you don't have access to the **Platform > API platform** page in Workato.

## Input

Input fields in the **Request** section define the structure of API requests to the endpoint:

| Input fields | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Content type** | Defines the data format of the request. Choose `application/json`, `text/plain` or `multipart/form-data`. Use `multipart/form-data` to upload large attachments (up to 5GB). |
| **Request header** | Defines the parameters request headers must have. |
| **Path parameters** | Defines the parameters to accept in the endpoint path for `JSON` and `Text/XML` requests. |
| **Query parameters** | Defines the parameters to accept in the endpoint's query string for `JSON` and `Text/XML` requests. |
| **Request structure** | Defines the outermost structure of the request body: a single `Object`, or a top-level array, such as an `Array of objects`, `Array of strings`, `Array of integers`, `Array of numbers`, `Array of booleans`, `Array of dates`, or `Array of date-times`. Defaults to `Object`. |
| **Request body** | Only appears when Request structure is set to `Object` or `Array of objects`, and when the legacy Request schema is empty. Defines the expected schema request bodies must have. Datapills for these fields appear in the Request body group. |
| **Request schema** | Legacy field that remains fully supported. Appears in recipes that defined a request schema before the Request body field was available. Defines the expected schema request bodies must have. Datapills for these fields appear in the Request parameters group and show as deprecated. Clear this field to define the Request body field instead. |

Input fields in the **Response** section define the structure of responses the endpoint sends:

| Input fields | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Content type** | Defines the data format of the response. Defaults to JSON if left blank. |
| **Response header** | Defines the parameters response headers will have. |
| **Responses** | Defines the possible responses to a request sent to the endpoint. This field has the following subfields:
| Input fields | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | The name of the response. For example: Unauthorized or Created |
| **Code** | The HTTP status code to be associated with the response which identifies the type of response. For example: Unauthorized responses are associated with 401 status codes. |
| **Response structure** | Defines the outermost structure of the response body: a single Object, or a top-level array, such as an Array of objects, Array of strings, Array of integers, Array of numbers, Array of booleans, Array of dates, or Array of date-times. Defaults to Object. |
| **Response schema** | Only appears when Response structure is set to Object or Array of objects. Defines the expected schema response bodies will have. |
