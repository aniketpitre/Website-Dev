# Extract JWT payload claims

Identity providers who manage employee identities often load several pieces of information about the subject, such as **Email**, **Employee ID**, or assigned **Permissions or scopes**. They write this information in the JWT as payload claims.

> **PAYLOAD SIZE QUOTA**
> 
> JWT payloads must not exceed a size quota of 10,240 bytes. Requests will fail if the payload exceeds this quota.

The following example shows a decoded JWT payload. The `sub` claim identifies the [API client](/en/api-mgmt/jwt-token#how-to-generate-jwt-tokens), while other claims describe the API caller:

```json
{
    "sub": "588dec828cc4fc6f579e5252ca4a3acb3d24527efa588e0329a9490a0d1dc062",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@acme.com",
    "acme_id": "A0122152",
    "admin": true
}
```

Workato parses the JWT and reads all payload claims. It prioritizes [standard claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims) and claims required for [API client authentication](/en/api-mgmt/jwt-workato-claim). If the payload exceeds the size quota, Workato truncates it, and some claims may become unavailable.

## How to extract JWT payload claims

Use the JWT claims datapill to access payload claims from the JWT in a recipe. Switch an input field to [formula mode](/en/formulas/formula-mode) and parse the datapill as a JSON object. You can then reference any available claim by key.

For example, to extract the `email` claim, map the JWT claims datapill and append `["email"]`:

Workato automatically parses the JWT at runtime and makes the claims available for use in your recipe logic.
