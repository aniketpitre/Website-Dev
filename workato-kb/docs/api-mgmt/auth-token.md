# Auth token

## Header

An Auth token is the simplest way to authenticate an API request with Workato.

How can I retrieve a new Auth token?

You can retrieve an Auth token when you [create a new API key](/en/api-mgmt/api-client-mgmt#create-a-new-application). You can only view this token once. If you lose the token, you will need to refresh and retrieve a new token.

1. Go to **Platform > API Platform > Clients** and select the client, then go to the **Applications** tab.
   
2. Click the **Refresh** button next to the API key you plan to retrieve an Auth token for. Refreshing your Auth token revokes access for clients using the current Auth token.

3. Save your Auth token in a secure place.
   

Configure a header with your Auth token. For example:

```shell
-H 'api-token: ed776fdfbf5003b4aa6bcaafea8f9003ffb6986454822ce7ebb3c1a8efc08348'
```

Workato reads this header value and recognizes that the request is from a verified API key when an API request is made.

## Basic authentication

You can authenticate the API request using the [basic auth scheme](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617). Use `api-token` as the username and your token value as the password. For example, in curl, you can pass the following credentials with the `-u` option:

```shell
-u api-token:ed776fdfbf5003b4aa6bcaafea8f9003ffb6986454822ce7ebb3c1a8efc08348
```

This command automatically constructs the `Authorization` header in the following format:

```shell
-H 'Authorization: Basic <encoded api-token:token>'
```
