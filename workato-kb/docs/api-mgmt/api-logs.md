# API logs

Use API logs to view a detailed record of all incoming API requests across your workspace. Logs help you monitor usage, troubleshoot failures, and track performance over time.

The logs table includes the request date and time, status, API collection, endpoint, client identity, IP address, and response time.

## Filters

Use the filters at the top of the **Logs** tab to narrow the results. You can filter by the following:

| Filter type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Period | Filter logs by time period, such as `Last 30 days`. |
| Status | Filter logs by status, such as `200 OK` or `404 Not Found`. |
| Gateway | Filter by the gateway used to route traffic, such as `Cloud` or `Edge`. |
| Client | Filter logs by specific clients, such as `Customer Success Team`. |
| Collection type | Filter logs by [Recipe collections](/en/api-mgmt/api-collections#create-api-recipe-collection) or [Proxy collections](/en/api-mgmt/api-collections#create-api-proxy-collection) types. |
| Collection | Select specific API collections to include in the results. |

Filters reset after you leave the page.

## Download logs as a CSV file

Select the **Download results** button to export the logs table as a CSV file. The CSV includes all visible fields from the logs UI and additional details to help diagnose API behavior.

The exported CSV includes the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Date | Timestamp when the API request was received. |
| Type | General outcome of the request, such as `Success` or `Error`. |
| Code | HTTP status code returned, such as `200`, `401`, or `404`. |
| Status | HTTP status text corresponding to the code, such as `OK` or `Not Found`. |
| Gateway code | Extended diagnostic code for failed requests, such as `4011` or `4012`. |
| [Status details](/en/api-mgmt/api-logs#status-details-for-failed-requests) | Diagnostic message for failed requests, such as `Unrecognized token`, `Missing token`, and `Recipe is inactive`. |
| IP | Client IP address. |
| Timing | Time taken to process the request. |
| Delay | Time between receiving the request and starting execution. |
| API collection | Collection associated with the API endpoint. |
| Endpoint | API endpoint path defined in the collection. |
| Client | Name of the client making the request. |
| Job details | Link to the recipe job triggered by the request, if applicable. |

### Status details for failed requests

The **Status details** column includes diagnostic messages for common client-side errors, such as `401` and `404`. These messages appear in downloaded logs, but not in the logs UI or client-facing responses.

Refer to [Status details for 401 and 404 errors](/en/api-mgmt/calling-apis#status-details-for-401-and-404-errors) for more information on status codes and messages.
