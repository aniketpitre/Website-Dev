> Learn how API endpoint caching stores GET responses to cut duplicate requests, speed up recipe actions, and reduce jobs.

# API endpoint caching

API caching improves recipe performance by reducing duplicate API requests.

Workato temporarily stores responses in a cache when you enabled this feature. If a recipe sends a duplicate request within the [retention period](#cache-retention), Workato returns the cached response instead of calling the endpoint again.

**Benefits**:

- Faster response times in recipe actions
- Fewer total jobs
- Decreased job duration
- Reduced traffic between applications

> **PREREQUISITES**
> 
> You must have the following prerequisites to use API endpoint caching:
> 
> - Access to the [API Platform](/en/api-management) feature
> - The [API platform](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/privileges-reference#api-platform) privilege

## Limits and quotas

Only successful `GET` requests that return a `2xx` status code can be cached.

| Description | Quota | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Maximum cache key size | 10 kB | NA |
| Maximum cache entry value size | 10 kB | Requests exceeding this quota do not cache even when successful. Contact your Workato Customer Success Manager to adjust this quota. |
| Maximum cache entry count per user ID | 10,000 entries | If exceeded, entries are flushed, from oldest to newest, to accommodate new entries. To adjust this quota, contact your Workato Customer Success Manager for support. |

## Enable endpoint caching

Configure the following fields in an endpoint's **Settings** tab or [during endpoint creation](/en/api-mgmt/configure-recipe-endpoint#step-1-create-the-endpoint) to enable API caching:

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Cache response | Enable or disable API caching. |
| Time-to-live period | Enter the time in seconds to retain API responses in the cache. The default value is `600` seconds (10 minutes) and the maximum is `3600` seconds (60 minutes). Refer to the [Cache retention](#cache-retention) section for more information. |
| Cache key parameters | Select the parameter(s) to use as a [cache key](#cache-keys). |

Endpoints with caching enabled have the **Cache enabled** badge:

## Cache retention

The **Time-to-live** field defines the amount of time that the cache retains each response.

For example, if you set the retention period to `600` seconds:

- Requests at 400 seconds access the response from the cache.
- Requests at 800 seconds call the endpoint, store the new response in the cache, and restart the retention period.

Each user ID [has a cache quota of 10,000 entries](#limits-and-quotas). When this quota is reached, the oldest entries are flushed to accommodate newer entries.

## Cache keys

The **Cache key parameters** field defines path and query string parameters to use as a cache key. If a request matches the key during the [retention period](#cache-retention), the request returns the matching entry from the cache.

Path parameter example

You can set a path parameter such as `/users/{id}` as the cache key to store responses based on a user's `id`.

The following request returns the cached response for the user ID `12345`, if it exists:

```shell
curl  -X GET https://api.myworkatoexample.com/docs/users/12345 \
      -H 'API-TOKEN: YOUR_TOKEN'
```

Query string example

You can set a query string such as `/users?id={value}` as the cache key to store responses based on a user's `id`.

The following request returns the cached response for the user ID `12345`, if it exists:

```shell
curl  -X GET https://api.myworkatoexample.com/docs/users?id=12345 \
      -H 'API-TOKEN: YOUR_TOKEN'
```

## Monitor endpoint caching

You can view details about cached responses on the **API platform > Logs** page. Requests that retrieved a response from the cache have a **Cached** badge.

## Clear cached endpoint data

Cached entries clear automatically, based on the [retention period](#cache-retention) you define. You can also complete the following steps to manually clear an endpoint's entire cache:

1. Go to **Platform > API platform > API collections**.
   
2. Click the collection that contains the endpoint you plan to clear.
   
3. Click **...** (more) on the endpoint you plan to clear.
   
4. Click **Clear cached responses**. A confirmation modal displays.
   
5. Click **Clear cache**.
   

## Re-validate cached entry

You can re-validate a cached entry by including the `Cache-Control: max-age=0` header in a request. For example:

```shell
curl https://api.myworkatoexample.com/docs/users/12345 \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
-H 'Cache-Control: max-age=0'
```
