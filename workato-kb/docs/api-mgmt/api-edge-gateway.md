> API Edge Gateway routes API traffic from on-premise environments to the Workato API platform with centralized management, observability, and policy control.

# API Edge Gateway

Edge Gateway allows administrators to securely route API traffic from on-premise environments to Workato's API platform while maintaining centralized management, observability, and policy enforcement. Gateways run locally within customer infrastructure but remain connected to the Workato control plane for configuration and telemetry.

> **BETA PRICING**
> 
> API Edge Gateway is currently available at no additional cost. Pricing takes effect after the beta pricing period ends.

## Key capabilities

Edge Gateways extend Workato's API gateway by processing API traffic securely on-premise with centralized control. It provides the following capabilities:

- **Local traffic processing**: Route and process API requests within your infrastructure to reduce latency and meet data residency requirements.
- **Hybrid deployment support**: Deploy API collections to cloud or edge gateways based on compliance, performance, or architectural needs.
- **Centralized policy and version management**: Manage configurations, monitor gateway health, and receive update notifications from the Workato cloud.
- **Observability and alerts**: Stream metrics and logs to the cloud, receive alerts for authentication failures, version mismatches, and connectivity loss.

## Architecture and deployment model

API Edge Gateway introduces a hybrid deployment model that separates management from traffic execution.

### Control plane and data plane

Edge Gateway separates control plane operations from data plane processing:

- **Control plane** runs in Workato cloud. It manages configuration, policies, versioning, and observability.
- **Data plane** runs in your infrastructure. It processes API requests and responses.

The gateway maintains a secure outbound connection to the Workato control plane over TLS (port 443).

### Deployment types

Workato supports two API gateway deployment types:

#### Cloud gateway

API traffic is processed within Workato's cloud infrastructure. No additional infrastructure or setup is required.

#### Edge gateway

API traffic is processed within your infrastructure while API management remains centralized in the Workato cloud.

Use Edge Gateway when your requirements include one or more of the following:

- Your organization has data residency obligations that prohibit API payloads from transiting external infrastructure, such as GDPR or HIPAA.
- Your backend services are hosted on-premise and routing traffic through the cloud introduces unacceptable latency.
- Your security policies require API traffic to remain within a defined network perimeter.

Use the cloud gateway if these requirements don't apply.

### API lifecycle integration

Edge Gateway doesn't change the API design and publishing workflow.

You can design, configure, and publish API collections in the Workato cloud. When you select Edge Gateway as the deployment target, the gateway synchronizes the published configuration and processes API traffic locally within your infrastructure.

### Collection-level deployment targeting

Workato supports per-collection deployment targeting. You can select either the cloud gateway or an Edge Gateway for each API collection at publish time.

This flexibility enables hybrid architectures where some APIs run in the Workato cloud and others run within customer infrastructure.

## Set up Edge Gateway

You must set up an Edge Gateway before you route traffic locally. Each Edge Gateway runs in your infrastructure and communicates with the Workato control plane over a secure gRPC channel.

> **PREREQUISITES**
> 
> You must have the following to set up an Edge Gateway:
> 
> - A Workato workspace with the **API Platform** enabled
> - Admin access to the workspace
> - A configured local environment

Complete the following steps to set up your edge gateway:

1. Go to **API Platform > Settings > Manage gateway**.
   
2. Click **Set up Edge gateway**.
   
   ![Set up Edge Gateway](/assets/set-up-edge-gateway.BA-wufOP.png)_Set up Edge Gateway_
   
3. Enter a **Gateway name** and select a **Connection method**. You can choose **Docker** or **Kubernetes (Helm)** based on your deployment environment.
   
4. Copy the **Installation command** generated in the dialog. The command includes both the bootstrap and runtime commands.
   
   You run these commands when you [deploy the gateway](#install-and-deploy-the-gateway) in your infrastructure.
   
   > **TOKEN VALIDITY**
   > 
   > Registration tokens expire after 5 minutes. Click **Regenerate command** if needed.
   
   ![Set up Edge Gateway](/assets/set-up-edge-gateway-dialog.CznfOfoC.png)_Set up Edge Gateway_
   
5. Click **Done**.
   

## Supported environments

API Edge Gateway supports the following environments:

- Linux (x86-64)
- Kubernetes v1.25 or later
- Docker-compatible container runtimes, including Docker and Podman

## Network requirements

The gateway requires outbound HTTPS (port 443) access to the following Workato endpoints:

- `apim-edge.workato.com`
- `telemetry.apim-edge.workato.com`
- `config.apim-edge.workato.com` (required during bootstrap only)

Endpoints use the following format for region-specific deployments:

- `apim-edge.<region>.workato.com`
- `telemetry.apim-edge.<region>.workato.com`
- `config.apim-edge.<region>.workato.com`

The gateway establishes a secure gRPC connection over TLS (port 443) using mutual TLS (mTLS).

Workato doesn't require inbound connectivity to your environment.

## Install and deploy the gateway

Deploy the gateway in your infrastructure using the command you copied during setup.

> **TOKEN VALIDITY**
> 
> Registration tokens expire after 5 minutes. Go to **API Platform > Settings > Manage gateway** and click **Regenerate command** if your token has expired.

### Supported installation methods

Workato supports the following deployment methods:

- [Docker](#docker-deployment)
- [Kubernetes (Helm chart)](#kubernetes-helm-deployment)

Use Docker for single-host deployments. Use Kubernetes for production environments that require orchestration and scaling.

### Docker deployment

Use Docker to deploy the gateway on a Linux host in a single-node or non-orchestrated environment.

Deployment consists of two phases:

- [Bootstrap the gateway](#docker-bootstrap).
- [Start the gateway runtime](#start-the-gateway-runtime).

#### Bootstrap the gateway

Run the bootstrap command generated in the Workato UI in a terminal on the Linux host where you plan to run the gateway container:

```shell
docker run --rm \
-v $(pwd)/config:/tmp/egw/config \
registry.workato.com/edge-gateway:<tag> \
/gateway bootstrap \
-t <registration-token> \
-o /tmp/egw/config \
standalone
```

Replace the following placeholders:

- `<tag>` with the image version displayed in the Workato UI.
- `<registration-token>` with the one-time registration token generated in the Workato UI. The token appears after the `-t` flag in the generated command and expires after 5 minutes.

The bootstrap command performs the following:

- Registers the gateway using the one-time registration token
- Establishes mutual TLS (mTLS) trust with the Workato control plane
- Generates configuration and credential files
- Writes the generated files to the `config` directory

Keep the `config` directory. The gateway runtime requires these files to start.

If you delete the config directory, run the bootstrap command again using a new registration token.

#### Start the gateway runtime

Start the gateway using the configuration generated during bootstrap:

```shell
docker run --rm \
-p 8080:8080 \
-v $(pwd)/config:/etc/edge-gateway/ \
registry.workato.com/edge-gateway:<tag>
```

The runtime performs the following:

- Reads configuration from `/etc/edge-gateway/`
- Connects to the Workato control plane over TLS (port 443)
- Processes API traffic on port 8080

Run the following to verify that the container is running:

```shell
docker ps
```

Run the following to view logs:

```shell
docker logs <container-id>
```

### Kubernetes (Helm) deployment

Use Kubernetes to deploy the gateway when you require orchestration, scaling, or rolling upgrades.

Deployment consists of the following phases:

- [Bootstrap the gateway](#helm-bootstrap)
- [Add the Workato Helm repository](#add-the-workato-helm-repository)
- [Deploy the runtime using Helm](#deploy-using-helm)

Run these commands from a machine that has Docker, Helm, and kubectl installed and configured with access to your Kubernetes cluster.

#### Bootstrap the gateway

Execute the bootstrap command generated in the Workato UI:

```shell
docker run --rm \
-v $(pwd)/config:/tmp/egw/config \
registry.workato.com/edge-gateway:<tag> \
/gateway bootstrap \
-t <registration-token> \
-o /tmp/egw/config \
helm
```

Replace the following placeholders:

- `<tag>` with the image version displayed in the Workato UI.
- `<registration-token>` with the one-time registration token generated in the Workato UI. The token appears after the `-t` flag in the generated command and expires after 5 minutes.

The bootstrap command registers the gateway with the Workato control plane and generates a Helm configuration file at `config/values.yaml`.

Keep the config directory. Helm uses this file to deploy the gateway. If you delete the config directory, run the bootstrap command again using a new registration token.

#### Add the Workato Helm repository

Add the Workato Edge Gateway Helm chart repository:

```shell
helm repo add workato-edge-gateway https://workato.github.io/edge-gateway-helm-charts
```

You only need to add the repository once per machine.

#### Deploy using Helm

Deploy the gateway using Helm:

```shell
helm upgrade -i \
  -n edge-gateway \
  -f config/values.yaml \
  --create-namespace \
  edge-gateway \
  workato-edge-gateway/workato-edge-gateway
```

Run the following to verify that the pod is running:

```shell
kubectl get pods -n edge-gateway
```

Run the following to view logs:

```shell
kubectl logs -n edge-gateway <pod-name>
```

## Verify gateway connection

After you create the gateway in Workato, it appears on the **Manage gateway** page. The gateway shows as active only after you deploy and start the runtime.

Complete the following steps after you start the runtime container (Docker) or deploy the Helm release (Kubernetes):

1. Go to **API Platform > Settings > Manage gateway**.
   
2. Confirm that **Instances** shows at least **1 online**.
   
3. Confirm that **Last synced** displays a timestamp.
   
4. Confirm that the gateway version appears correctly.
   

These indicators confirm that the gateway:

- Established a secure mTLS connection to the Workato control plane.
- Synchronized configuration.
- Began processing API traffic.

Perform the following checks if the gateway doesn't appear online:

- Check container or pod logs.
- Confirm outbound HTTPS (port 443) access to required Workato endpoints.
- Verify that the registration token was valid during bootstrap.

## Publish API collections to Edge Gateway

After your gateway is online, you can publish API proxy collections to it. Select the edge gateway as the deployment target in the **API gateway** field when you create or edit an API proxy collection.

Edge Gateway supports API proxy collections only. API recipe collections aren't supported on Edge Gateway.

Auth policies, rate limiting, and other collection settings apply to Edge Gateway the same way they apply to the cloud gateway. Refer to [API proxy collections](/en/api-mgmt/api-collections/proxy-collection) for more information.

## Manage Edge Gateway

You can monitor and manage all edge gateways from the **Manage gateway** section after setup. Each gateway runs one or more instances and syncs with the Workato cloud for configuration and observability.

![Edge Gateway interface](/assets/edge-gateway-interface.B-hrP3HY.png)_Edge Gateway interface_

You can view the following for each gateway:

- Deployment name
- Number of instances
- Gateway version and update availability
- Last synced timestamp

Click the **...** (ellipses) next to a gateway to rename it, generate an installation command, or delete it. Deleting an Edge Gateway removes it from your workspace and deactivates all associated endpoints.

![Manage gateway](/assets/manage-edge-gateway.Ci7GV4O1.png)_Rename, reinstall, or delete the gateway_

### Update gateway version

Workato alerts you when a new version of your gateway becomes available. Complete the following steps to update your gateway using the method that matches your original installation:

1. Click the **Update to \[version\]** badge next to the gateway version.
   
2. Review the update command and release note in the dialog. Click **Copy** to copy the command for your installation method.
   
3. Run the command in your local environment to pull the latest container or apply the update.
   
4. Click **Done** to close the dialog. The new version appears in the status panel after the gateway reconnects.
   

### Control plane connectivity

Edge Gateway maintains a secure outbound connection to the Workato control plane to synchronize configuration and send telemetry.

The gateway automatically enters **fallback mode** if it loses connectivity to the control plane. The following occurs in fallback mode:

- The gateway continues processing API traffic using the last cached configuration.
- Configuration updates from the control plane are paused.
- Telemetry and status reporting are temporarily suspended.

Normal operation resumes automatically after the gateway reconnects to the control plane.

## Deployment constraints

The following constraints apply to API Edge Gateway deployments:

- One gateway per workspace environment.
- No enforced quota on the number of instances per gateway.
- Collection quotas follow the same constraints as the standard API gateway.

API Edge Gateway is deployed as a dedicated collection type.

## Limitations

API Edge Gateway has the following limitations:

- API recipe collections aren't supported
- Request and response transformations aren't supported
- Custom request validation isn't supported
- Certificate validation formula isn't supported
- Air-gapped environments aren't supported

API Edge Gateway supports all policy types available in the standard API gateway.

## Edge Gateway and OPA

In an OPA-based hybrid deployment, API traffic routes through the Workato cloud, while the OPA evaluates policies locally within your environment. Edge Gateway keeps all API traffic within your environment and processes inbound requests locally. The gateway maintains a secure outbound connection to the Workato control plane for configuration and observability.

Edge Gateway consolidates the following capabilities into a single runtime deployment:

- Authentication and rate limiting.
- Traffic routing to internal services.
- Gateway policy enforcement.
- Metrics and telemetry collection.

This architecture simplifies hybrid API deployments and reduces reliance on separate policy engines or tunnel-based integrations.
