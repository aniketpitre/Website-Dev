# Copilots - Data usage

We prioritize your privacy and data security, selectively retrieving contextual data to ensure optimal Copilot performance. Copilot only uses data directly related to the recipes you create within Workato. This does not include any third-party application data or job logs. Specifically, recipe data is defined as recipe steps, input fields, and apps used in your recipes.
