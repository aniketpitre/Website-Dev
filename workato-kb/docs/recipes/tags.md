# Tags for assets

Tags are labels you apply to assets to add context and group them across projects. You can filter and search by tag to find assets that share an attribute.

> **TAG LIMITS**
> 
> Tags are subject to the following quotas:
> 
> | Description | Quota |
> | --- | --- |
> | Maximum number of tags in a workspace | 1,000 |

## How tags improve asset management

Tags enhance asset organization by offering flexibility in categorization and search capabilities, by providing the following workflow enhancements:

- Organize assets across projects
  
- Group assets based on shared attributes, enabling effective management across project boundaries.
  
- Streamline search and filtering
  
- Locate assets by filtering based on tags, simplifying the search process.
  
- Provide better context
  
- Add context, clarifying the purpose or category of an asset at a glance and improving workspace organization.
  

## Tag management permissions

Tag management is controlled through workspace settings. Collaborators with the [Environment admin](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/system-environment-roles#environment-admin) role, a custom environment role with the [Workspace access privilege](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/privileges-reference#workspace-access), or the legacy [Admin system role](/en/roles#system-roles) can configure which users can create, edit, and delete tags. The following permissions apply based on your configuration:

- **View tags**: Any user in the workspace can view tags.
- **Manage tags**: Admins and users with WS permissions can create, edit, and delete all tags across the workspace.
- **Create and manage personal tags**: Any user can create, edit, or delete their own tags if the **Restrict tag management** toggle is disabled. If enabled, only admins and users with WS permissions can manage tags.
- **Apply or remove tags**: Users with asset edit permissions can apply or remove tags on assets they can edit.

Ensure the appropriate permissions are set to allow the necessary users to manage tags effectively.

### Configure tag management permissions

Complete the following steps to configure tag management permissions:

1. Navigate to **Workspace admin > Settings > Workspace > Tags**.
   
   ![Manage tag permissions](/assets/tag-permissions.inQA8l9I.png)_Manage tag permissions_
   
2. Configure the **Restrict tag management** toggle. This setting controls who can manage tags in your workspace:
   
   - **OFF**: Allows all users to create, edit, or delete their own tags. Admins and users with workspace settings (WS) permissions can manage all tags, including those created by other users.
   - **ON**: Only admins or users with WS permissions can create, edit, or delete tags. Users with asset edit permissions can apply or remove tags on assets they can edit but cannot create, update, or delete tags.
3. Click **Save** to apply your configuration. The permissions are now set according to your selection.
