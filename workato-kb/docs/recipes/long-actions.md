> Learn how Workato long actions process bulk data over minutes to hours without timeout errors, including supported connectors and long pauses.

# Long actions

Long actions (or long running actions) are a special class of Workato actions that excels at processing bulk data. Long actions may require several minutes to hours to complete.

Under normal circumstances, actions throw a [timeout error](/en/recipes/jobs#timeouts) after a certain amount of time has elapsed. However, long actions allow the action to complete without raising a timeout error.

> **LONG ACTIONS NOW SUPPORTED IN TEST MODE**
> 
> Long actions are now supported in test mode. This means that you can click the **Test recipe** button to test recipes that contain batch actions, wait actions, long queries, and multi-step SDK actions.

## How does this work?

Workato temporarily puts the job on hold and checks periodically to determine if the long action has completed processing when the job execution reaches a long action. Workato proceeds to the next step in the recipe after the action completes.

> **LONG ACTIONS JOB SEQUENCE**
> 
> If your recipe has a long action step and job, note that [when the action is put on hold](/en/recipes/long-actions#how-does-this-work), Workato automatically disregards the job sequence. The next job begins to process even if the previous job is not finished and the recipe concurrency is set to `1`.

## Handle long pauses in recipes

Workato supports long pauses in recipe execution for up to 732 days. This includes single-step pauses, such as the Scheduler by Workato [Wait for time duration](/en/features/scheduler/actions/wait-for-time-duration) and [Wait until specified time](/en/features/scheduler/actions/wait-until-specified-time) actions, and cumulative pauses across multiple steps.

Use pauses to wait until a specific time or for an external event, such as an approval or trigger.

Recipes may fail if they exceed the total configured cumulative pause duration across all long actions.

## Supported long actions
