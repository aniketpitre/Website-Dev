# Recipe version management

Every time a recipe is saved, a version of the recipe is created. Previous versions of a recipe can be restored at any time. Recipe versions can be viewed in the **Versions** tab and are denoted by their version number.

In the version history view, each version is attributed to the user who made the change (relevant for multi-user team accounts), with a timestamp when the version was saved, as well as the change type associated with that version.

## Change Types

There are two types of changes:

- [Recipe changes](#recipe-changes)
- [Schema changes](#schema-changes)

### Recipe Changes

A **Recipe change** is logged when a user actively changes the recipe. For example, adding, or removing steps and changing field mappings, will create a new version of the recipe when the recipe is saved.

### Schema Changes

A **Schema change** is logged when Workato detects that the underlying schema of objects in the recipe have changed. For example, when a Salesforce custom object has a new field added.

Such [schema refreshes](/en/recipes/editor#refresh-schema) will automatically create a new version of the recipe.

## Comparing And Reviewing Changes

Using the **Recipe Diff** feature, you can visually compare two recipe versions and review the changes. Check out the [Recipe Diff](/en/recipe-development-lifecycle/compare-versions-with-recipe-diff) guide for more info.
