# Testing recipes

Workato's integrated recipe testing environment allows you to test your recipe before starting it. Testing ensures that your automation's works correctly and processes data accurately, helping you avoid extensive clean-up later.

### What is a test job?

A test job is executed in Workato's recipe testing environment, known as **Test mode**. During a test job, Workato uses new trigger data from the trigger application to test the steps in your recipe that have not been skipped.

### What is test mode?

Test mode picks up a single trigger event and proceeds through all unskipped actions in the recipe. When finished, the test job is logged in the recipe's [job history](/en/recipes/jobs), and its details will be available for your review.

### What trigger data is used to run test jobs?

The trigger event used to run a test job depends on the trigger type:

- Polling triggers
  
- Polling triggers check for new events by periodically querying the connected app. The trigger event used for a test job depends on the trigger's [When first started, this recipe should pick up events from](/en/recipes/triggers#since-from) date. Learn more about [polling triggers](/en/recipes/triggers#polling-triggers).
  
- Real-time triggers
  
- Real-time triggers receive events as they occur. Workato uses the first event received by the trigger to execute the test job. For instance, if you use a webhook, create an event in the source application to send a notification to the recipe trigger. Learn more about [real-time triggers](/en/recipes/triggers#real-time-triggers).
  
- Recipe function triggers
  
- For recipe function triggers, you provide the trigger event data. For example, if your trigger requires a `user_id` value as input, you must provide a sample `user_id` value to run a test job. Refer to the [Manually testing triggers](#trigger-manual-test) section for more information.
  

### What's the recommended way to use test mode?

Use the following best practices when testing your recipes:

- **Use sandboxes instead of production accounts**: Test your recipes in sandbox environments rather than production accounts. This approach allows you to work with realistic data without risking changes to mission-critical production data.
  
- **Build and test incrementally**: Construct your recipe in small, logical segments and test at each stage. This practice ensures the recipe flow is coherent, and datapills are correctly mapped. It also simplifies debugging.
  
  > **BUILD YOUR RECIPES INCREMENTALLY WITH SKIP STEP**
  > 
  > The **Skip step** feature allows you to ignore steps when running a recipe. Skipping steps can be useful when you’re building a recipe and only want to test a part of it.
  > 
  > Learn more about how to use [skip step](/en/recipes/steps/skip-step).
  
- **Build and test for all possible scenarios**: Recipes can contain multiple paths based on conditional logic. Testing allows you to check that all conditions in your recipe are present and correct.
  
- **Test all mapped data**: To ensure that data is processed correctly, test all data fields and mappings thoroughly.
  
  For example, if you are transferring `Account Name`, `Account Description`, and `Account Phone` from Salesforce to Zendesk, verify the following during testing:
  
  - The fields in Salesforce contain valid data.
  - The input fields in Zendesk receive the correct values.
  - Unexpected or missing values are handled appropriately, if necessary.

### How do I view test jobs?

To view test jobs from test mode, click the **job time** drop-down in the job results section. In the menu that displays, click **See all test jobs**:

![View all past test jobs](/assets/view-all-test-jobs.Y_wAOkxq.gif)_View all past test jobs_

Click on individual jobs in the job report table to open the job. Once opened, you can view details for each step or [repeat the job](#repeat-test-job).

### Can I repeat a test job?

Yes. Repeated jobs re-use the original job's trigger data but run on the latest recipe version.

To repeat a job from test mode, click **Repeat job** in the job results section:

![Highlighted Repeat job button in test mode](/assets/repeat-job-button.CBS336IK.png)_Highlighted Repeat job button in test mode_

When a job has been repeated, a second drop-down containing the repeat jobs will display next to the **job time** in the job results section:

![Repeat job menu and history](/assets/repeat-job-dropdown.7iS6ZX0b.png)_Repeat job menu and history_

Click on individual jobs in the drop-down to open the job. Once opened, you can view details for each step or repeat the job.

## Limitations

When using test mode for your recipes, consider the following:

- **Not all trigger types are supported**: The following trigger types can't be used in test mode:
  
  - Scheduled connector triggers, such as the **Salesforce - Scheduled record search using SOQL** trigger
  - Workbot commands
- **Some trigger types require manual configuration to test**: [Recipe function](/en/connectors/recipe-functions) triggers require you to supply test data to run tests. Refer to the [Manually testing triggers section](#trigger-manual-test) for more information.
  
- **Some trigger configurations can't be modified once the recipe has been tested or started**: If a trigger requires a [When first started, this recipe should pick up events from](/en/recipes/triggers#since-from) date, for example, you can't change the date after a recipe has been tested or started.

## Running test jobs

In Workato, there are two ways you can kick off a test job:

- [Semi-automatically](#trigger-standard-test)
- [By manually providing trigger data (Recipe functions)](#trigger-manual-test)

> **IS YOUR RECIPE TEST-READY?**
> 
> Running a test job requires the following:
> 
> - A fully configured trigger
> - Valid data mappings
> - Valid connections
> 
> Workato will check that your recipe meets these requirements when you click **Test**. If there's an issue, you'll be prompted to address it.

### Testing triggers

1. In your Workato account, open a recipe in **Edit** mode.
   
2. In the recipe editor, click **Test**.
   

After you click **Test**, Workato will:

- Check that required fields are populated
- Validate data mappings, if applicable
- Validate connections, if applicable

If the data checks are successful, Workato will begin the test job. The [test results](#test-results) will display when the job completes.

### Manually testing triggers

Complete the following steps to manually test your trigger:

> **APPLICABLE TO SELECT CONNECTORS**
> 
> This section applies to [Recipe functions](/en/connectors/recipe-functions).

1. Sign in to Workato and open a Recipe function in **Edit** mode.
   
2. Click **Test**. The **Add trigger data** window will display.
   
3. Provide the data Workato should use to invoke the test job. There are two ways to provide the data:
   
   Form fields view
   
   The **Form fields view** displays a form with each field configured in the trigger's input. To use it, click **Change view > Form fields view**.
   
   Enter values for the trigger input fields. **Note**: Only plaintext and static lists are allowed.
   
   ![Form fields view for manual trigger testing](/assets/test-manual-trigger-form-view.8MutgEKh.png)_Configure manual trigger form fields view_
   
   Raw JSON
   
   The **Raw JSON view** accepts a valid JSON object containing the trigger's input fields. To use it, click **Change view > Raw JSON view**.
   
   Enter values for the trigger input fields, which are the fields in the `parameters` object:
   
   ![Raw JSON view for manual trigger testing](/assets/test-raw-json-view.CcK4xG6-.png)_Configure manual trigger raw JSON view_
   
   Along with the input fields (`parameters`), the JSON view includes a `context` object. The `context` object is prefilled with sample output of the calling recipe and job IDs (`0`), but can be overwritten.
   
   **Note**: The data in this window will be lost if you refresh or navigate away from the current recipe page.
   
4. Click **Test recipe**.
   

After the manual trigger test data is submitted, Workato will:

- Check that required fields are populated
- Validate JSON syntax, if JSON was provided

If the data checks are successful, Workato will begin the test job. The [test results](#test-results) will display when the job completes.

* * *

## Using test results

After the test job completes, the test results will display. Test jobs can result in one of the following:

- [Success](#successful-jobs)
- [Failure](#failed-jobs)
- [No jobs found](#no-jobs-found)

### Successful jobs

Successful jobs include the recipe path, input, and output:

![Viewing a successful test job](/assets/test-successful-job.C-Ahk6Jb.gif)_Viewing a successful test job_

### Failed jobs

Failed jobs include the recipe path, input, output, and debugging information.

Additionally, Workato will highlight the step at which the error occurred. Click the step view details about the issue, including a description of the error:

![Viewing a failed job](/assets/test-unsuccessful-job.DbqmUKjk.png)_Viewing a failed job_

Fix the errors in **build mode** before repeating the job or running a new test.

### No jobs found

If the test job doesn't find a trigger event, the test job may continue to run until you [cancel it](#cancel-test-job).

When trigger events aren't found, we recommend:

1. **Checking the trigger's configuration**. Some triggers allow you to specify the date from which records are picked up. Verify that this field is correctly configured:
   
   ![Defined since date for a Salesforce object trigger](/assets/set-since-date-for-trigger.C1S9PKTM.png)_Defined since date for a Salesforce object trigger_
   
2. **Creating or updating a record in the trigger app and testing again.** The recipe should pick up the trigger event if the trigger is configured correctly.
   
   In the above example, the recipe is configured to pick up Salesforce accounts **created or updated on or after July 14, 2020 00:00:00**. If we create or update a Salesforce account now, the test job should detect the event.
   
3. **Creating a copy of the recipe and setting the trigger to an earlier date**. This approach allows you to try testing with another date where you know a trigger event will be available.
   
   If, for example, you know a Salesforce account was created on **May 31, 2020**, set the trigger date in the copied recipe to **before this date**. This guarantees that at least one trigger event is available to test the recipe.
