# AIRO

AIRO is Workato's AI automation engineer that transforms intent into production-ready business solutions.

Meet AIRO: your teammate inside Workato

You describe the outcome you want to achieve, and AIRO understands your intent and designs the solution. It builds the automations, AI agents, Enterprise Skills, APIs, and MCP servers required, then helps you deploy, monitor, and continuously improve them. You don't need to be a Workato expert, navigate multiple product pages, or manually stitch together workflows to get started.

Behind every conversation is a team of specialized AI agents working together. Rather than acting as isolated assistants, they share context, coordinate their work, and understand your entire Workato environment, from the assets you're building to the jobs running in production. AIRO brings together the right expertise to help you achieve your outcome faster, whether you're creating something new, optimizing an existing workflow, or exploring your workspace.

AIRO is available throughout Workato and from MCP-compatible AI clients and development environments such as Claude Code and Cursor. Your conversation and context follow you wherever you work. Start with an idea, continue refining it from a project, inspect a production issue, or modify a recipe, all within the same conversation.

With AIRO, Workato becomes an AI-first platform that lets you focus on business outcomes while it handles the complexity of building, operating, and evolving enterprise automation.

## How AIRO works

AIRO routes your request to specialized agents based on what you need.

- **Questions and guidance**: Dedicated knowledge agents handle troubleshooting, feature guidance, and analysis directly.
- **Full build requests**: The Solution Architect pipeline takes a PRD or natural language description through requirements analysis and asset planning, producing blueprints and built assets.
- **Single asset builds**: Ask AIRO to create a specific asset, such as a recipe, and it builds it directly without going through the full blueprint flow.

## Enable AIRO in your workspace

Complete the following steps to enable AIRO in your workspace:

1. Go to **Workspace admin > Settings > Workato AI**.
   
2. Click **Enable AIRO**.
   
3. Click **Enable AIRO** again to confirm the changes.

## Your new homepage

AIRO is your new landing page; start chatting with AIRO, review urgent alerts, or resume building where you left off.

Your homepage shows recent work, quick-start options for new projects, and alerts about your integrations. These alerts surface incidents detected by [Acumen](#monitor-operations-with-acumen) in your production automations.

![Homepage](/assets/landing-page.cBPXUNU_.png)_Homepage_

Refer to [Homepage](/en/airo/homepage) for more information.

## Chat with AIRO

Use AIRO's conversational interface to get help, build automations, and manage workflows from anywhere in the platform.

- Refer to [Chat](/en/airo/chat) to learn how to start conversations and maintain context across pages.
- Refer to [Manage chat history](/en/airo/chat/chat-history) to organize multiple conversations and keep your AI interactions organized across different projects.

## What AIRO knows

AIRO uses knowledge sources from your organization, your workspace, and the Workato platform to give you accurate, relevant answers:

- **Company-specific knowledge**: AIRO uses playbooks you upload about your organization's policies, standards, and best practices to ensure that answers reflect your compliance, security, and operational requirements. Refer to [AIRO Playbooks](/en/airo/knowledge/manage) to upload and manage these playbooks.
- **Workspace assets**: AIRO accesses recipes, projects, connections, and other assets in your workspace to understand your automations and provide relevant suggestions.
- **Workato documentation**: AIRO references the [Workato documentation](/en/) to answer questions about features, connectors, and best practices.
- **Product updates**: AIRO stays current with the latest Workato features and changes through the [platform changelog](https://www.workato.com/product-hub/changelog/).

Refer to [What AIRO knows](/en/airo/knowledge-bases) for a full list of AIRO's knowledge sources.

## Plan projects with blueprints

AIRO plans before it builds multi-step automations and complex projects. The Solution Architect pipeline turns your business requirements into a complete implementation plan called a blueprint. Provide a PRD or natural language description, and AIRO analyzes your requirements, identifies gaps, and produces the blueprint.

![Solution Architect pipeline](/assets/solution-architect-agent-pipeline.CSAVytlx.svg)_Solution Architect pipeline_

The following tabs show how AIRO guides you through the process:

**Define process**

Start with a business requirement or product requirements document that describes what you plan to automate.

![Define process](/assets/start-with-prd.n-tGCbNg.png)_Define process_

**Provide requirements**

Share your PRD through chat, upload a document, or paste your requirements.

![Provide your requirements](/assets/ask-airo-prd.BABiPL0p.png)_Provide your requirements_

**Fill in gaps**

AIRO asks targeted questions about applications, triggers, business logic, and error handling.

![Complete your requirements with AIRO](/assets/complete-requirements.CPwOLIjl.png)_Complete your requirements with AIRO_

**Choose project**

Select the project where you plan to save your blueprint.

![Choose the project to save your blueprint in](/assets/choose-project.vEPG4gWK.png)_Choose the project to save your blueprint in_

**Generate blueprint**

AIRO creates a complete implementation plan with all needed assets.

![Review the generated blueprint](/assets/generated-blueprint.BXyk7D-b.png)_Review the generated blueprint_

**Start building**

Review your blueprint and build the assets you need for your automation.

![AIRO builds a skill](/assets/build-asset.XxkIyI22.png)_AIRO builds a skill_

- Refer to [Blueprints](/en/airo/blueprints) for an overview of this asset type.
- Refer to [Create your first blueprint](/en/airo/blueprints/create) for a step-by-step walkthrough using an employee onboarding example.
- Refer to [Edit your blueprint](/en/airo/blueprints/edit) for how to keep refining a blueprint after AIRO generates it.
- Refer to [Best practices for writing requirements](/en/airo/blueprints/requirements-best-practices) for tips on giving AIRO the details it needs.
- Refer to [Manage blueprints](/en/airo/blueprints/manage) for organizing your blueprints.

## Build assets with AIRO

When a request is simple, AIRO skips the blueprint flow and builds the asset directly in your workspace. Describe what you need in the chat and AIRO creates it.

- Refer to [Build recipes with AIRO](/en/airo/build/recipes) to build recipes from a chat description.

## Use AIRO from external AI clients

The AIRO MCP server exposes your full Workato workspace to MCP-compatible AI clients such as Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and Cursor. Once connected, you can build recipes, manage Genies, query data, and administer workspace assets directly from your AI development environment using natural language.

Refer to [AIRO MCP server](/en/airo/mcp) for setup instructions and supported clients.

## Manage, monitor, and optimize with Acumen

Acumen is the part of AIRO that supports your automations after they go live, helping you manage, monitor, and optimize them in production. It extends AIRO's coverage across the full lifecycle instead of stopping at build.

Refer to [Acumen](/en/airo/acumen) to learn how it monitors your workspace, accelerates troubleshooting, and forecasts usage.

## See AIRO in action

Browse examples of AIRO building automations from a single request.

- Refer to [Declutter your inbox](/en/airo/usage-inspiration/declutter-inbox) to sort a cluttered inbox into Slack alerts and labeled folders.
- Refer to [Automate your to-do list](/en/airo/usage-inspiration/automate-to-do-list) to turn meeting notes into to-do items and a Slack rundown.
- Refer to [Build a form-to-Slack alert](/en/airo/usage-inspiration/form-to-slack-alert) to get notified in Slack the moment someone submits a form.
- Refer to [Find unused assets](/en/airo/usage-inspiration/find-unused-assets) to ask AIRO what's idle in your workspace.

## Quotas

Each workspace has its own AIRO token budget per model, computed over a rolling 60-second window. When a workspace exceeds its budget, subsequent requests are throttled and users may see up to a 30-second delay in AIRO responses until the budget refreshes.
