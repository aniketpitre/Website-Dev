> Create a Microsoft Teams Enterprise Workbot with custom branding, OAuth profile, and permissions using the Microsoft Teams Developer Portal.

# Create a Microsoft Teams Enterprise Workbot

Enterprise [Workbots](https://www.workato.com/platform/workbot?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=workbot) are Microsoft Teams apps you create that can leverage the Workato bot platform under the hood. You can fully customize your bot's identity, such as:

- Branding (bot name, bot logos, accent color)
- Custom OAuth profile (bot ID, App secret)
- Permissions

These Microsoft Teams apps can be sideloaded into your Microsoft Teams groups or channels for use by your members. If you want control over your bot's branding and permissions or multiple purpose-specific bots, Enterprise Workbots are for you.

> **FEATURE AVAILABILITY**
> 
> The Enterprise Workbot feature is available to customers on specific pricing plans. Refer to your pricing plan and contract to learn more.

> **DEPRECATION NOTICE**
> 
> This page uses the [Microsoft Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/) to create and manage an app. As of **January 1, 2022**, Microsoft has deprecated App Studio.
> 
> The approach outlined on this page is the new, recommended method, but the [App Studio instructions](/en/workbot-for-teams/guides/creating-enterprise-workbot-app-studio) have been retained for reference.

> **VIRTUAL PRIVATE WORKATO (VPW) CUSTOMERS**
> 
> This feature requires configuration steps that are specific to your Virtual Private Workato (VPW) instance. If you are a VPW customer, refer to your VPW private documentation for the configuration details for your instances.

## Prerequisites

To set up an Enterprise Bot, you must have the following:

- **In Workato**:
  
  - **Access to:**
    
    - **Workbot**: If you don’t see the **Platform > Workbot** option in your account, contact your Customer Success Manager.
    - [**Custom OAuth profiles**](/en/custom-oauth-profiles): If you don’t see the **Tools > Custom OAuth Profiles** option in your account, contact your Customer Success Manager.
  - **Privileges that allow you to:**
    
    - Create and configure Workbots.
    - Create and configure custom OAuth profiles.
- **In your Microsoft organization**:
  
  - **One of the following roles:**
    
    - Application administrator
    - Cloud application administrator
    - Global administrator
    - Privileged role administrator

> **DELEGATED PERMISSIONS AND APPLICATION PERMISSIONS**
> 
> You can set up an Enterprise Workbot to use either [Delegated or Application permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview?tabs=http#permission-types).
> 
> Delegated permissions, set as the default option, use the OAuth user's permissions to establish the connection in Workato. The user configuring the connection must have one of the required roles.
> 
> Application permissions offer enhanced security compared to Delegated permissions. This method keeps the connection independent of the user, preventing disconnection if the user logs out and allowing a non-administrator to set up the connection.
> 
> Refer to the [Set up Application permissions (optional)](#set-up-application-permissions-optional) step for more information.

Check your role assignments in [Microsoft](https://portal.azure.com/) by going to **Users > You (select your name) > Assigned roles**.

## Create the Workbot in Workato

Complete the following steps to create the Workbot in Workato:

1. Sign in to your Workato account.
   
2. Go to **Platform > Workbot**.
   
3. Click the **Custom bots** tab. If you don't see this tab, ensure your workspace has access to [Custom OAuth profiles](/en/custom-oauth-profiles).

### Add a client secret

Complete the following steps to add a client secret to your bot in the Microsoft Azure portal:

> **CLIENT SECRETS**
> 
> Client secrets expire periodically, typically every year, and require renewal. This applies to both Embedded and Direct use cases. For Embedded scenarios, only the Embedded partner needs to refresh the token used in the shared custom OAuth profile; end customers don't need to take any action. You can check your access token's expiration date at [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Go to **Manage > Certificates & secrets > Client secrets**.
   
2. Select **\+ New client secret**.

6. Click **Copy to clipboard** next to the secret in the **Value** column. Client secret values cannot be viewed again after they are created. Ensure that you save the secret securely before leaving the page.
   

## Configure Workato to talk to the app

1. Go back to the Workato page from the [Create the Workbot in Workato](#step-1) step.

   - **Client ID - your bot ID**: Enter the **Bot ID** from the [Create the bot in the Microsoft Teams Developer Portal](#step-2-1) step. Also located in **Tools > Bot management > Your bot**.
   - **Client secret**: Enter the **client secret** from the [Add a client secret](#step-2-5) step.
   - **Application ID**: Provide the app ID. You can find this value in the Developer Portal by going to **Apps**, selecting your app, and clicking **Basic information**.
3. Click **Save**.
   

## Publish to your org

Complete the following steps to publish your app to your organization:

1. Go to the Microsoft Teams Developer Portal tab.
