> Let end users upload files to an Enterprise Workbot in Microsoft Teams using file parameters, with content stored in OneDrive for follow-up actions.

# Files for Enterprise Workbot

End users can upload files to [Enterprise Workbots](/en/workbot-for-teams/guides/creating-enterprise-workbot) when `file` parameters are defined in the bot commands. These files are uploaded to the user's **OneDrive for Business** storage, and its data can then be used in follow-up recipe actions. You can upload files using personal scopes, such as direct messages (DMs), but uploading files to channels is not supported.

The file portion of the trigger output looks like this:

| Output fields | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| contentType | Indicates that a file was uploaded to OneDrive and ready for download. | `application/vnd.microsoft.teams.file.` `download.info` |
| downloadUrl | OneDrive URL for fetching the content of the file. You can issue an HTTP GET directly from this URL. | `https://download.link` |
| uniqueId | Unique file ID. This will be the OneDrive drive item ID. | `1150D938-8870-4044-9F2C-5BBDEBA70C9D` |
| contentUrl | Link to the file in Sharepoint. | `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/personal/` `johnadams_contoso_com/Documents/Applications/` `file_example.txt` |
| name | Name of the file | `file_example.txt` |
| file\_comment | The message sent by the user along with the file upload. | This is an example file upload. |

> Enterprise Workbots created before October 30, 2021, typically do not have the `supportsFiles` property set to `true` in their manifest. [Learn how to update it](/en/workbot-for-teams/files-for-bots#enabling-files-for-older-bots).

## How it works

A user sends a message to Workbot with their intended bot command and then upload your file when prompted.

Once the file is uploaded, the user can optionally include a message before hitting **Send**. The file data can then be used in follow-up recipe actions.

Multiple file parameters can be defined in the bot command, with the user being prompted each time. Regardless of the order in which the parameters are arranged in the bot command, parameters of other data types, such as string or date/time, is retrieved before any file parameters.

## Enabling files for older bots

If your Enterprise Workbot was created before October 30, 2021, you must set the `supportsFiles` property in the manifest to `true`. This property is described in the bots section of the manifest reference.

1. As the bot owner, go to your bot in the [Microsoft Teams developer portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/apps).
   
2. From the left navigation bar, under **Configure**, go to **Basic information**.
   
3. From the main panel, under **Version**, increment your version, then scroll down and click **Save**.
   
   For example, if your current version is `1.0.5`, increment it to `1.0.6`.
   
4. From the left navigation bar, under **Configure**, go to **App features**.
   
5. From the main panel, click **Bot**.
   
6. Under **What can your bot do?**, check **Upload and download files**, then scroll down and click **Save**.
   
   This allows users to upload files through personal scopes, such as direct messages (DM).
   
7. From the left navigation bar, under **Publish**, go to **App package**. From the breadcrumb bar (right below the **Developer Portal** marquee), click **Download app package** to download the app manifest. Keep this handy as this will be used in a later step.
   
8. Go to the [Microsoft Teams admin portal](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com).
   
9. From the left navigation bar, under **Teams apps**, go to **Manage apps**.
   
10. From the search bar, search for your bot by name then click your bot's name (clicking specifically on your bot's name brings you to your bot's settings).
    
11. Click **Update**, then select the app manifest you downloaded in the earlier step.
