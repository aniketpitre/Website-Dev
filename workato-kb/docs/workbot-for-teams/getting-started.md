# Set up Workbot for Microsoft Teams

This guide explains how to set up a standard Workbot for Microsoft Teams connection.

> **STANDARD WORKBOT CONNECTION LIMIT**
> 
> Only one standard Workbot connection per Microsoft Teams organization is supported. Use [Enterprise Workbot](/en/workbot-for-teams/guides/creating-enterprise-workbot) instead if you need multiple Workbots in the same organization. Enterprise Workbot requires a custom OAuth profile.

## Prerequisites

Before you set up Workbot for Microsoft Teams, ensure you have the following:

- A [Microsoft work or school account](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/what-account-do-i-use-with-office-and-why-do-i-need-one-914e6610-2763-47ac-ab36-602a81068235?ui=en-US&rs=en-IE&ad=IE#bkmk_msavsworkschool). These accounts are typically set up by your organization's administrator. Personal Microsoft accounts aren't supported.
- [Microsoft Graph permissions](#microsoft-graph-permissions).
- An [admin role](#required-roles) in the Azure portal.

> **MICROSOFT MFA ENFORCEMENT**
> 
> Microsoft is rolling out mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA) gradually to different applications and accounts in phases. This enforcement continues throughout 2025 and beyond. Refer to the Microsoft [Mandatory multifactor authentication for Azure and admin portals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication?tabs=dotnet) documentation for more information.
> 
> We strongly recommend enabling MFA now for all Microsoft accounts used with Workato to avoid service disruptions from short-notice enforcement changes.
> 
> Complete the following steps to maintain uninterrupted service:
> 
> 1. Enable MFA for your Microsoft organization following the Microsoft MFA setup guide. Refer to [Set up multifactor authentication for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide) for more information.
>    
> 2. Reconnect your Microsoft connection in Workato.
>    
> 3. Complete the OAuth flow with MFA when prompted.
>    
> 4. Test your recipes to ensure they work with the updated connection.
>    

### Microsoft Graph permissions

Workbot for Microsoft Teams requires the following [Microsoft Graph permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference):

| Permission | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [AppCatalog.Read.All](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#appcatalogreadall) | Delegated | Required to retrieve the installed app ID for a user from the Microsoft Teams app catalog. |
| [Channel.ReadBasic.All](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#channelreadbasicall) | Delegated | Lists channels used in **Post message** or **Post simple message** actions. |
| [Team.ReadBasic.All](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#teamreadbasicall) | Delegated | Retrieves the organization ID and name to track where the bot is installed. |
| [TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteAndConsentSelfForUser](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#teamsappinstallationreadwriteandconsentselfforuser) | Delegated | Required to install Workbot in the signed-in user's personal scope. |
| [User.Read](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#userread) | Delegated | Retrieves the authenticating user's ID and name to track who installed the bot. |
| [User.ReadBasic.All](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#userreadbasicall) | Delegated | Retrieves basic information about users. |
| [offline\_access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#offline_access) | Delegated | Enables token refresh functionality. |

> **PROACTIVE MESSAGING REQUIRES APPLICATION PERMISSIONS**
> 
> These Delegated permissions install Workbot only for the signed-in user. Installing Workbot into another user's personal scope, which proactive messaging requires, needs an [Enterprise Workbot](/en/workbot-for-teams/guides/creating-enterprise-workbot) connection with [Application permissions](/en/workbot-for-teams/application-permissions). Refer to [Proactive messaging](/en/workbot-for-teams/proactive-messaging) for more information.

### Required roles

You must have one of the following roles to install Workbot in your Microsoft organization:

- Application administrator
- Cloud application administrator
- Global administrator
- Privileged role administrator

![Assigned roles](/assets/assigned-roles.BlQfGn8M.png)_Administrator Assigned Roles_

If you're installing Workbot as a global administrator, you can optionally select **Consent on behalf of your organization** during [connection setup](#complete-setup-in-workato). This allows you to reconnect Workbot in Workato without administrator approval during reauthorization.

"Bot already installed to the team" error

The **Bot already installed to the team** error means another standard Workbot connection is already active in your Microsoft Teams organization. Only one standard Workbot connection per Microsoft Teams organization is supported.

![Duplicate Workbot connection error](/assets/duplicate-workbot-connection-error.DkHC70lR.png)_Duplicate Workbot connection error_

Perform one of the following actions to resolve this:

- Find and disconnect the existing standard Workbot connection, then attempt to connect again.
- Use [Enterprise Workbot](/en/workbot-for-teams/guides/creating-enterprise-workbot) to run multiple Workbots in the same Microsoft Teams organization.

## Use Workbot in a recipe
