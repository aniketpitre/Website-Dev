> The Automation HQ Workspace lets you manage quotas, settings, moderators, and monitor automations across all managed workspaces in your Workato account.

# HQ Workspace

You can access the Automation HQ features in the [HQ Workspace](https://app.workato.com/organization_console). The HQ Workspace enables you to manage quotas, update settings, and monitor automations across all Workspaces in your account.

## Workspaces

Get an overview of all managed workspaces in your organization at a glance. See key metrics like the number of billable recipes, task usage in the current accounting period, number of collaborators, and connected applications.

## Workspace moderators

To help your teams set up the managed workspaces, assign workspace moderators. Workspace moderators have access to all workspaces in your organization.

Only members in the HQ workspace can be assigned as workspace moderators.

## Shared connectors

Build and maintain [custom connectors](/en/developing-connectors/sdk) using the Workato SDK and distribute them to the managed workspaces. Ensure that all your workspaces are using the latest version of your custom connectors.

## Usage

Workspaces share a pooled task quota, allowing you to allocate tasks across managed workspaces and adjust as needs change.

The **Usage** section provides an overview of consumption and plan details across all workspaces. Key components include the following:

- Plan overview
  
- A consolidated report that displays plan details, total tasks used, percentage of task usage, and plan renewal date.
  
- Task usage
  
- Displays task consumption across workspaces.
  
- Recipe usage
  
- Displays recipe activity and usage data across workspaces.

## Settings

You can set up organization-wide Audit log streaming in the [Settings](/en/ahq-settings) interface. After setup, all logs from the [HQ Workspace](#hq-workspace) and all managed workspaces stream to a single destination.

Audit log streaming is off by default. To set it up, see [Audit log streaming for Automation HQ](/en/ahq-audit-log-streaming).

## Cross-workspace grants

You can enable [cross-workspace grants](/en/cross-share-streams) for the entire organization from the [Settings](/en/ahq-hq-workspace#settings) interface. Source workspaces can grant other managed workspaces access to their Event streams topics when enabled.

Cross-workspace grants are off by default. Refer to [Enable cross-workspace grants](/en/cross-share-streams#enable-cross-workspace-grants) to set it up.
