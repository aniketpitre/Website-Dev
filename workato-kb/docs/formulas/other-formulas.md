> Reference for Workato formulas that work across data types, including null, clear, and accessing nested values with square brackets.

# Other formulas

This section covers formulas that work with a number of data types.

Formulas in Workato are allowlisted Ruby methods. Syntax and functionality for these formulas are generally unchanged. Most formulas return an error and stop the job if the formula operates on nulls (expressed as `nil` in Ruby), except for `present?`, `presence`, and `blank?`.

If a Ruby method is not found in the Workato documentation, it is not included in the allowlist and is therefore unsupported. Contact your Customer Success Manager to request new formulas for the allowlist.

## Access nested values using square brackets

Square brackets (`[]`) allow you to access values in a hash in Workato. For nested hashes, you can chain lookups like `data["a"]["b"]["c"]`. However, this method raises a `NoMethodError` if any part of the chain doesn't exist (for example, if `"b"` is missing).

Use the [safe navigation operator](/en/formulas/conditions#safe-navigation-operator) (`&.`) instead to safely access nested values without errors. For example, `data["a"]&.[]("b")&.[]("c")`. This returns `nil` if any part of the chain is `nil`.

## null

Gives a null/nil value.

> **USE FORMULAS TO CLEAR A FIELD**
> 
> Passing `null` into an input field does not update the field value to null. Toggle the field to formula mode and use the [clear](#clear) formula to update a field value to null.

![Null formula in input field](/assets/null-formula.C8UEOdYm.png)

* * *

## clear

Clears the value of the field in the target app to null/nil. Remember to toggle the field to formula mode.

![Clear formula in input field](/assets/clear-formula.DU63da2X.png)_Use clear formula instead of null when looking to clear field in target app_

* * *

## skip

Passes nothing to the destination app for this field. If the field has an existing value, it will be left untouched.

### Example

This example attempts use an updated Salesforce record to update a lead in Marketo. It checks if the Salesforce Company is present. If yes, it will output the Salesforce Company into Marketo. Otherwise, the Marketo record is left untouched.

## uuid

Generates an UUID.

### Example

| Example | Result |
| --- | --- |
| uuid | "c52d735a-aee4-4d44-ba1e-bcfa3734f553" |

* * *

## encrypt

Encrypts the input string with a secret key using AES-256-CBC algorithm. Encrypted output string is packed in [RNCryptor V3](https://github.com/RNCryptor/RNCryptor-Spec/blob/master/RNCryptor-Spec-v3.md) format and base64 encoded.

> **STORE ENCRYPTION KEYS USING ENVIRONMENT PROPERTIES**
> 
> Do not hard code your encryption key in the recipe. Instead, use environment properties (with `key` or `password` in the name) to store encryption keys.

### Example

`encrypt([ssn], [encryption_key])`

* * *

## decrypt

Decrypts the encrypted input string with a secret key using the AES-256-CBC algorithm. The encrypted input string should be packed in [RNCryptor V3](https://github.com/RNCryptor/RNCryptor-Spec/blob/master/RNCryptor-Spec-v3.md) format and base64 encoded.

The [Ruby decrypt method](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/ruby_methods#decrypt) returns a byte array instead of a string by default. You can convert the decrypt method output to a string by appending the `.as_string()` or `.as_utf8` function to your formula.

> **DON'T HARDCODE ENCRYPTION KEYS IN A RECIPE**
> 
> The encryption key should not be hardcoded in the recipe. Use [environment properties](/en/features/account-properties) (with `key` or `password` in the name) to store the encryption keys.

* * *

## lookup

This formula allows you to lookup values from your Workato lookup tables using a key. The lookup formula is datatype-sensitive and case-sensitive.

If you use a datapill in the lookup formula, we recommend that you convert the data to the correct format. For example, convert integer-type datapills to a string with a `.to_s` formula if you plan to compare a column that contains both integers and strings.

### Syntax

Use the following syntax to structure the formula:

```text
lookup('Lookup table name', 'Match column': 'Match value')['Return column']
```

This formula searches for a row in the specified lookup table where **Match column** matches the **Match value**. It then returns the value from the specified **Return column** in that row.

The formula includes the following parameters:

- `Lookup table name`: The lookup table to query.
- `Match column`: The column used as the lookup key.
- `Match value`: The value that identifies the row in the key column.
- `Return column`: The column that provides the result.

### Example

For example, let's use the following lookup table with name `Department Code` with an ID of 6:

![Sample department codes lookup table](/assets/department-codes-lookup-table.BTcBZPW5.png)_Sample department codes lookup table_

| Example | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `lookup('Department Lookup table', 'Department Code': 'ACC')['Department']` | "Accounting" |
| `lookup('Department Lookup table', 'Department Code': 'SLS')['Department']` | "Sales" |
| `lookup('Department Lookup table', 'Department': 'Marketing')['Department Code']` | "MKT" |
| `lookup('Department Lookup table', 'Department': 'marketing')['Department Code']` | nil Matching is case sensitive, unable to find value "marketing" |
| `lookup('Department Lookup table', 'Department': 'Marketing')['Department code']` | nil Matching is case sensitive, unable to find column "Department code" |
| `lookup('6', 'Department code': 'ACC')['Department']` | "Accounting" Note: Remember to enclose the lookup table ID in quotes `""`. |

> **Using Lookup ID**
> 
> You can use the lookup table name and lookup table ID interchangeability. You can find the lookup table ID in the URL.
> 
> For example:
> 
> ```
> https://app.workato.com/lookup_tables/<lookup_table_id>
> ```

* * *

## lookup\_table

This formula allows you to create a static lookup table and define the keys and values. It is case-sensitive and datatype-sensitive.

### Example

| Example | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `{"key1" => "value1", "key2" => "value2", "key3" => "value3"}["key2"]` | "value2" |
| `{"High" => "urgent", "Medium" => "mid", "Low" => "normal"}["Low"]` | "normal" |
| `{"High" => "urgent", "Medium" => "mid", "Low" => "normal"}["low"]` | nil |
| `{"High" => "urgent", "Medium" => "mid", "Low" => "normal"}["normal"]` | nil |
| `{1 => "1", 2 => "2", 3 => "3"}[2]` | "2" |
| `{1 => "1", 2 => "2", 3 => "3"}[2.0]` | nil |
| `{1 => "1", 2 => "2", 3 => "3"}["2"]` | nil |

* * *

## data\_table\_lookup

This formula allows you to look up values from your [data tables](/en/data-tables) using a key. The lookup formula is case-sensitive and datatype-sensitive.

If you use a datapill in the lookup formula, we recommend that you convert the data to the correct format. For example, convert integer-type datapills to a string with a `.to_s` formula if you plan to compare a string-typed column.

Ensure that project name, table name, lookup key, and lookup criteria are written exactly the way they are stored in the data table, including proper capitalization.

### Syntax

Use the following syntax to structure the formula:

```text
data_table_lookup('Project name', 'Table name', 'Column name': 'Value to search on')['Return column']
```

This formula searches for a row in the specified data table where **Column name** matches the **Value to search on**. It then returns the value from the specified **Return column** in that row.

The formula includes the following parameters:

- `Project name`: The project that holds the data table. This value can also include folder names within the project, separated by `/` (for example, `'Project name/Folder name'`).
- `Table name`: The specific data table to query.
- `Column name`: The column used to find the match.
- `Value to search on`: The value that identifies the row in the key column.
- `Return column`: The column that provides the result.

### Example

For example, let's use the following data table with name `Wedding Guests` inside the `Wedding` project:

![Sample "Wedding Guests" Data table](/assets/wedding-guests-data-table.mzqzbpUN.png)_Sample "Wedding Guests" Data table_

| Example | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `data_table_lookup('Wedding', 'Wedding Guests', 'Transport': 'Yes')['Seat No.']` | "10" |
| `data_table_lookup('Wedding', 'Wedding Guests', 'Lunch': 'No')['First Name']` | "A little" |
| `data_table_lookup('Wedding', 'Wedding Guests', 'First Name': 'Angela')['Table No.']` | 1 |
| `data_table_lookup('Wedding', 'Wedding Guests', 'First Name': 'angela')['Table No.']` | nil Matching is case sensitive, unable to find value "angela" |
| `data_table_lookup('Wedding', 'Wedding Guests', 'First Name': 'Angela')['Table no.']` | nil Matching is case sensitive, unable to find column "Table no." |
| `data_table_lookup('Wedding', 'Wedding Guests', 'first name': 'Angela')['Table No.']` | nil Matching is case sensitive, unable to find column "first name" |

* * *

## data\_table\_query

This formula allows you to query records from your [data tables](/en/data-tables) using flexible filter conditions. Unlike `data_table_lookup`, which matches on equality and returns only the field values of a single row, `data_table_query` can also:

- Return multiple matching records in a single call.
- Include each record's ID (so a later action can use it to update, delete, or relate that record), creation time, and last updated time.
- Filter using operators beyond equality, such as greater than, less than, or a list of possible values.

> **LARGER QUERIES OR PAGINATION**
> 
> Use the [Search records action](/en/data-tables/connector/search-records-action#search-records) for queries that need pagination or need to process more records than `data_table_query` allows.

The query is case-sensitive and datatype-sensitive. Ensure that the project name, table name, column names, and filter values are written exactly the way they're stored in the data table, including proper capitalization.

### Syntax

Use the following syntax to structure the formula:

```text
data_table_query('Project name', 'Table name', {query options})
```

The formula includes the following parameters:

- `Project name`: The project that holds the data table. This value can also include folder names within the project, separated by `/` (for example, `'Project name/Folder name'`).
- `Table name`: The specific data table to query.
- `query options`: A hash that defines what to return and how to filter, sort, and limit the results. Refer to [Query options](#data-table-query-options).

#### Query options

The `query options` hash accepts:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | **string** _required_ | Controls how many records the query expects to match and what the formula returns when zero, one, or multiple records match. Refer to [Mode](#data-table-query-mode) for the full breakdown. |
| `where` | **hash** _optional_ | Filter conditions. Uses the same operators and structure as the Query records endpoint's [`where` clause](/en/workato-api/data-tables#where-field-structure): Equal (`$eq`), Not equal (`$ne`), Greater than (`$gt`), Greater than or equal to (`$gte`), Less than (`$lt`), Less than or equal to (`$lte`), In a list of values (`$in`), Starts with (`$starts_with`) You can combine conditions with `$and`. Filtering a Date or DateTime column requires an actual Date or DateTime value, for example `'2026-07-01'.to_date`, not a plain string. |
| `select` | **array** _optional_ | The list of columns to include in each record's `fields` hash. Returns all columns if omitted. |
| `order` | **hash** _optional_ | Sets the sort order of the results. Uses the same `{by: <field>, direction: 'asc'|'desc'}` structure as the Query records endpoint's [`order` field](/en/workato-api/data-tables#order-field-hash-structure), where `direction` is `'asc'` (ascending) or `'desc'` (descending). |
| `limit` | **integer** _conditional_ | Required when `mode` is `'all'`. Optional when `mode` is `'some'` (default 50). Not used for `one_*` modes. The maximum allowed value is 50. |
| `timezone_offset_secs` | **integer** _conditional_ | The time zone offset, in seconds, used when comparing a datetime column to a date value in `where`. Required for that comparison. Optional otherwise. For example, comparing a DateTime column to `'2026-01-01'.to_date` throws an error without `timezone_offset_secs`. Adding `timezone_offset_secs: 0` resolves it. |

You can reference a column by its name, or use the built-in fields `$record_id`, `$created_at`, and `$updated_at` in `where` and `order`. These built-in fields can't be listed in `select`, since they're included in the result. If a column name itself starts with `$`, add an extra `$` to reference it (for example, a column named `$ spent` is referenced as `$$ spent`).

Query option keys, operators, and field names each accept either a symbol or a string. For example, `where: {...}` and `'where' => {...}` behave the same way.

**Link to a table** and **File** columns work a little differently, both for filtering and for reading their values back:

- To filter by a **Link to a table** column, use the ID of the record it links to.
- To filter by a **File** column, use the file's name.
- A returned **Link to a table** column includes both the linked record's `record_id` and its `display_name`.
- A returned **File** column includes the file's `filename`.
- A **multivalue column** (one that can hold more than one value) returns a list of values instead of a single one.

#### Mode

`mode` controls how many records the query expects to match and what the formula returns when zero, one, or multiple records match:

| Mode | Returns | If zero or multiple records match |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `one_unique` | A single record. | Throws an error if no record matches, and throws an error if more than one record matches. |
| `one_unique_optional` | A single record, or `nil`. | Returns `nil` if no record matches. Throws an error if more than one record matches. |
| `one_first` | The first matching record, in the sort order set by `order`. | Throws an error if no record matches. |
| `one_first_optional` | The first matching record, in the sort order set by `order`, or `nil`. | Returns `nil` if no record matches. |
| `all` | All matching records, as an array under the `records` key. Requires `limit`. | Throws an error if more records match than `limit` allows. |
| `some` | Up to `limit` matching records (default 50), as an array under the `records` key. | Ignores any records beyond `limit`. Doesn't throw an error based on the number of matches. |

### Examples

The following examples use a `Customers` data table with `Company name`, `Region`, `Revenue`, and `Status` columns:

| Company name | Region | Revenue | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Acme Corp | West | 120000 | Active |
| Acme Consulting | East | 95000 | Active |
| Acme Industries | West | 60000 | Active |
| Acme LLC | Central | 45000 | Inactive |
| Globex Inc | East | 200000 | Active |
| Initech | West | 30000 | Inactive |
| Umbrella Corp | Central | 80000 | Active |
| Stark Industries | East | 150000 | Active |

Find a record's ID to use in a later action

**Query**:

```text
data_table_query('Sales', 'Customers', {where: {'Company name': 'Globex Inc'}, mode: 'one_unique'})['record_id']
```

**How it works**:

Uses `mode: 'one_unique'` to require exactly one match, then reads `record_id` from the result.

**Result**:

Returns `"9309e4c0-2548-4508-b938-c781e77a7dda"`, the ID of the only company named "Globex Inc".

Look up a related value, with a fallback

**Query**:

```text
data_table_query('Sales', 'Customers', {where: {'Company name': 'Nonexistent Co'}, mode: 'one_unique_optional'})&.[]('fields')&.[]('Region') || 'Unknown region'
```

**How it works**:

Uses `mode: 'one_unique_optional'` so a missing company returns `nil` instead of an error, then falls back to a default with `||`.

**Result**:

Returns `"Unknown region"`, because no company named "Nonexistent Co" exists in the table.

Filter with an operator, and aggregate the results

**Query**:

```text
data_table_query('Sales', 'Customers', {where: {'Company name': {'$starts_with': 'Acme'}}, mode: 'all', limit: 50, select: ['Revenue']})['records'].pluck('fields').pluck('Revenue').sum
```

**How it works**:

Uses the `$starts_with` operator in `where` with `mode: 'all'` to get every match as an array, then sums one field across all of them.

**Result**:

Returns `320000`, the combined revenue of the four companies whose name starts with "Acme".

Collect a field across every matching record

**Query**:

```text
data_table_query('Sales', 'Customers', {where: {'Region': 'West'}, mode: 'all', limit: 50})['records'].pluck('fields').pluck('Company name')
```

**How it works**:

Uses a plain equality filter in `where` with `mode: 'all'` to collect every match, then plucks a single field from each.

**Result**:

Returns `["Acme Corp", "Acme Industries", "Initech"]`, the three companies in the West region.

Get the top-ranked matching record

**Query**:

```text
data_table_query('Sales', 'Customers', {order: {by: 'Revenue', direction: 'desc'}, mode: 'one_first_optional'})&.[]('fields')
```

**How it works**:

Uses `order` to sort by `Revenue` descending, then `mode: 'one_first_optional'` to return just the top result.

**Result**:

Returns the fields of Globex Inc, the company with the highest revenue, or `nil` if the table has no records.

#### Return value

A record is a hash with `record_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `fields` keys. `one_unique`, `one_unique_optional`, `one_first`, and `one_first_optional` return a single record in this shape, or `nil`. For example:

```text
data_table_query('Sales', 'Customers', {where: {'Company name': 'Globex Inc'}, mode: 'one_unique'})
```

This query returns the following record:

```json
{
  "record_id": "9309e4c0-2548-4508-b938-c781e77a7dda",
  "created_at": "2026-07-28T15:00:00.000+00:00",
  "updated_at": "2026-07-28T15:00:00.000+00:00",
  "fields": {
    "Company name": "Globex Inc",
    "Region": "East",
    "Revenue": 200000,
    "Status": "Active"
  }
}
```

`all` and `some` return a hash with a `records` key, whose value is an array of records in this shape. For example:

```text
data_table_query('Sales', 'Customers', {where: {'Company name': {'$starts_with': 'Acme'}}, mode: 'all', limit: 50})
```

This query matches four companies. The following shows the first two:

```json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "record_id": "...",
      "created_at": "...",
      "updated_at": "...",
      "fields": {
        "Company name": "Acme Corp",
        "Region": "West",
        "Revenue": 120000,
        "Status": "Active"
      }
    },
    {
      "record_id": "...",
      "created_at": "...",
      "updated_at": "...",
      "fields": {
        "Company name": "Acme Consulting",
        "Region": "East",
        "Revenue": 95000,
        "Status": "Active"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---
