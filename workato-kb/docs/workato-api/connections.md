## Create a connection

Create a new connection. This endpoint supports the following actions:

- Create a shell connection
- Create and authenticate a connection
- Create a custom LLM connection to use your own model with a genie
- Create an MCP server connection to assign to a genie

> **OAUTH CONNECTIONS**
> 
> The Developer API allows you to create OAuth 2.0 connections. However, connection types that would normally redirect you to a sign-in screen, such as `oauth` or `oauth2_auth_code_grant`, require an `oauth_token_pair` object containing an access token and a refresh token. Client credentials grant connections don't require an `oauth_token_pair` object. You can create a shell connection in cases where you don't have an access token and refresh token.
> 
> Refer to the [Connection parameters reference](/en/workato-api/connections-parameters-dev#oauth-authentication) page for more information.

<api-code no-copy-method>

            "folder_id": ":folder_id",
            "input": {
              "server_url": ":server_url",
              "auth_type": ":auth_type"
            }
          }'
```

</api-code>

### Response

```json
{
   "application":"jira",
   "id":36,
   "name":"Prod JIRA connection",
   "description":null,
   "authorized_at":"2023-01-26T22:53:52.528Z",
   "authorization_status":"success",
   "authorization_error":null,
   "created_at":"2023-01-26T22:53:52.532Z",
   "updated_at":"2023-01-26T22:53:52.532Z",
   "external_id":null,
   "folder_id":1892,
   "connection_lost_at":null,
   "connection_lost_reason":null,
   "parent_id":null,
   "project_id":12314295,
   "on_prem_group_id":null
}
```

The `id` is a unique identifier for the connection. For custom LLM and MCP server connections, use it to attach the connection to a genie:

- **Custom LLM connection**: Pass the `id` as `ai_provider` in [Update a genie](/en/workato-api/agent-studio#update-a-genie).
- **MCP server connection**: Pass the `id` when you [assign an MCP server to a genie](/en/workato-api/agent-studio#assign-a-skill-to-a-genie).

Example response for a custom LLM connection:

```json
{
   "application":"<provider>",
   "id":4821,
   "name":"Custom LLM connection",
   "description":null,
   "authorization_status":"success",
   "authorization_error":null,
   "folder_id":1892,
   "parent_id":null,
   "project_id":12314295,
   "on_prem_group_id":null
}
```

### Use a custom LLM connection with a genie

Convert the connection's `id` to a string and pass it as `ai_provider_id` with `ai_provider_type` set to `custom` in [Update a genie](/en/workato-api/agent-studio#update-a-genie) to power a genie with your custom LLM. The connection must use the `byollm` connector, be connected, and belong to a folder your API client can access.

<api-code>

```shell
curl -X PUT https://YOUR_DATA_CENTER/api/agentic/genies/:genie_id \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api_token>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
           "ai_provider_type": "custom",
           "ai_provider_id": ":connection_id"
         }'
```

</api-code>

The following example creates a connection and captures its `id` for the genie update:

<api-code>

```shell
export LLM_CONNECTION_ID="$(
  curl -sS -X POST https://YOUR_DATA_CENTER/api/connections \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api_token>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "provider": "byollm",
      "name": "Custom OpenAI",
      "folder_id": ":folder_id",
      "input": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "api_key": ":api_key",
        "model": "gpt-4o"
      }
    }' | jq -r '.id'
)"
```

</api-code>
