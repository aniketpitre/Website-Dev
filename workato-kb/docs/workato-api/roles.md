> Reference for the Workato legacy roles API to list, update, and copy custom roles in the legacy permissions model.

# Developer API - Legacy roles

Use the following endpoints to programmatically manage legacy roles.

> **LEGACY ROLES**
> 
> This page describes the legacy permissions model. Workato is replacing legacy roles with the new permissions model, which uses environment roles and project roles. You can migrate legacy roles using the [Role migration API](/en/workato-api/role-migration) or the [in-app migration wizard](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/migrate-roles). Refer to the [New permissions model](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/access-control-v2) documentation for more information.
> 
> After migration, these endpoints are deprecated. Refer to [RBAC 2.0 migration - Developer and Embedded API changes](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/rbac2-migration-api-changes) for the exact behavior.
