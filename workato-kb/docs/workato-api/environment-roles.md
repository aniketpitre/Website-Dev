> Reference for the Workato environment roles API to list, retrieve, create, update, and delete environment roles in your workspace.

# Developer API - Environment roles

Use the following endpoints to manage your [environment roles](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/access-control-v2#environment-roles).

Environment roles can have the following values:

| Value | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| system | Default roles provided by Workato. |
| custom | Roles created manually within a workspace. |
| inheritable | Custom roles from an AHQ admin or Embedded partner workspace that are inheritable by child workspaces. |
| inherited | Roles inherited by a child workspace from its AHQ or Embedded parent workspace. |

> **LEGACY ROLE COMPATIBILITY**
> 
> The following endpoints are only compatible with new roles where the `role_type` is `environment`.
> 
> Use the [/api/roles](/en/workato-api/roles) endpoints instead to manage legacy roles where the `role_type` is `privilege_group`.

### Response

A successful request returns a `204 No Content` status code. The API deletes the environment role and returns an empty response body.

400 BAD REQUEST

A `400 Bad Request` error indicates that the server couldn't process the request due to client-side issues. Common causes include malformed requests, invalid fields, or violations of field constraints, such as unsupported data types.

In the following example, the request fails because the role is still assigned to some collaborators:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "bad_request",
      "title": "You can’t delete a role when collaborators are assigned to the role."
    }
  ]
}
```
