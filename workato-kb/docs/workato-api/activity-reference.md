# Developer API - Activity audit log reference

This page provides a reference for the resource types and event types you can use as query parameters to filter responses from the [Get activity audit log API](/en/workato-api/environment-management#get-audit-log).

- **Resource types** specify which resource categories the API should include in the activity audit log results. For example, use `include_resource_types[]=flow` to retrieve only activities related to recipes.
- **Event types** define the events logged for these resource types, such as creating or deleting a recipe.

The resource types and event types listed in this document are specific to the activities available in **your workspace** for direct customers and the **admin workspace** for Embedded partners. You can use the following query parameters to include or exclude these types in your results:

- `include_resource_types[]`
- `include_event_types[]`
- `exclude_resource_types[]`
- `exclude_event_types[]`
