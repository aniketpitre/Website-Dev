> Reference for the Workato projects API to build, deploy, and manage projects across the environments in your workspace.

# Developer API - Projects

In Workato, [projects](/en/projects) are used to organize automation assets and control access. A project holds a set of related assets for your automations, including connections, recipes, and subfolders.

> **WHO CAN USE THESE APIS?**
> 
> Accounts with the [Environments](/en/features/environments) feature enabled can use the APIs in this guide. Requests sent from accounts without this feature will receive a `400 - Environments not provisioned` response.

The Project APIs enable you to programmatically manage and deploy projects to the environments provisioned in your workspace.

* * *

## Understanding project deployment

In Workato, there are two ways to deploy projects:

- **Build and then deploy**. This approach can be used if you want to commit the package to an external version control system. Steps for accomplishing this would be similar to the following:
  
  1. Build the project: `POST /api/projects/:id/build`
     
  2. Verify the project built successfully: `GET /api/project_builds/:id`
     
  3. If committing to a version control system like GitHub, use the `download_url` from Step 2's response to download the package.
     
  4. Commit the package to your version control system.
     
  5. Deploy the project build to an environment: `POST /api/project_builds/:id/deploy?environment_type=:environment_type`
     
  6. Verify the project deployed successfully: `GET /api/deployments/:id`
     
- **Build and deploy in one step**. If you don't need to commit the project to a version control system, you can use this approach:
  
  1. Build and deploy the project to an environment: `POST /api/projects/:id/deploy?environment_type=:environment_type`
     
  2. Verify the project deployed successfully: `GET /api/deployments/:id`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **id** | **integer** | The deployment ID. |
| **created\_at** | **timestamp** | The time the deployment was created. |
| **updated\_at** | **timestamp** | The time the deployment was last updated. |
| **description** | **string** | The deployment description. This will be `null` if not provided in the request that created the deployment. |
| **project\_build\_id** | **integer** | The ID of the project build associated with the deployment. |
| **environment\_type** | **string** | The environment associated with the deployment. |
| **project\_id** | **string** | The ID of the project associated with the deployment. |
| **state** | **string** | The current state of the deployment. |
| **detailed\_state** | **string** | A detailed description about the current state of the deployment. |
| **performed\_by\_name** | **string** | The name of the user who performed the deployment. |
| **assets** | **array** | An array of assets included in the deployment. |
| **assets\[id\]** | **integer** | The asset ID. This value is `null` for new assets not yet created in the target environment. Edited or removed assets contain a non-null ID. |
| **assets\[name\]** | **string** | The name of the asset. |
| **assets\[type\]** | **string** | The asset type. |
| **assets\[state\]** | **string** | The state of the asset. For example, `new`. |
| **assets\[folder\]** | **string** | The folder containing the asset. |

The `assets` array describes details about the deployment’s assets such as their names, types, folders, and states in the target environment.

Each asset's `id` field contains its unique identifier in the target environment. Assets with `"state": "new"` have `id: null` because they do not exist yet in the target environment. These assets receive an ID when they are created during deployment. Assets with `"state": "updated"` or `"state": "deleted"` already exist in the target environment and include their existing `id`.

For example, in the JSON response, the Salesforce and Zendesk connections are new assets, so their `id` values are `null`. These assets receive IDs when they are created in the target environment during deployment.

- Invalid `deployment_id`
