> Reference for the Workato data pipelines API to create, configure, start, stop, and clone pipelines, re-sync objects, and monitor object runs.

# Developer API - Data pipelines

Use the following endpoints to manage [data pipelines](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/create-data-pipeline-recipe) programmatically. You can create and configure pipelines, start and stop them, re-sync objects, and monitor object runs. These endpoints are available in workspaces with data pipelines enabled. Data pipelines and connections are environment-scoped, so an API client can only access pipelines and connections in the environment it belongs to.

## Endpoint access

Your [API client](/en/workato-api/api-clients#api-client-benefits) must have the appropriate privileges to access these endpoints. Configure the **Data Pipelines** section when you [create](/en/workato-api/api-clients#create-a-client-role) or [edit](/en/workato-api/api-clients#edit-a-client-role) a client role to control these privileges. Refer to [Data Pipelines privileges](#data-pipelines-privileges) for the available options.

### Data Pipelines privileges

The **Data Pipelines** privilege group includes the following options:

| Privilege | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| **List data pipelines** | `GET /api/data_pipelines` |
| **Get data pipeline details** | `GET /api/data_pipelines/:data_pipeline_id` |
| **Create data pipeline** | `POST /api/data_pipelines` |
| **Update data pipeline** | `PUT /api/data_pipelines/:data_pipeline_id` |
| **Delete data pipeline** | `DELETE /api/data_pipelines/:data_pipeline_id` |
| **Start data pipeline** | `PUT /api/data_pipelines/:data_pipeline_id/start` |
| **Stop data pipeline** | `PUT /api/data_pipelines/:data_pipeline_id/stop` |
| **Clone data pipeline** | `POST /api/data_pipelines/:data_pipeline_id/clone` |
| **Trigger resync for data pipeline** | `POST /api/data_pipelines/:data_pipeline_id/resync` |
| **List objects in data pipeline** | `GET /api/data_pipelines/:data_pipeline_id/objects` |
| **List runs for data pipeline** | `GET /api/data_pipelines/:data_pipeline_id/runs` |
| **Get run details** | `GET /api/data_pipelines/:data_pipeline_id/runs/:run_id` |
| **List source providers** | `GET /api/data_pipelines/sources` |
| **List destination providers** | `GET /api/data_pipelines/destinations` |
| **List source objects** | `POST /api/data_pipelines/source_objects` |
| **List source object fields** | `POST /api/data_pipelines/source_object_fields` |
| **Get configuration schema** | `POST /api/data_pipelines/:data_pipeline_id/configuration` |

## Rate limits

Data pipeline resources have the following rate limits:

| Type | Resource | Quota |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All | All [Data pipelines](/en/workato-api/data-pipelines.html) endpoints | 60 requests per minute |

## Quick reference

| Type | Resource | Description |

| GET | [/api/data\_pipelines/:data\_pipeline\_id/runs/:run\_id](#get-a-pipeline-run) | Get an object run. |

## Create and run a pipeline

The [Get configuration schema](#get-configuration-schema) and [Update a data pipeline](#update-a-data-pipeline) endpoints require a pipeline ID, so you must create a pipeline before you configure it. Complete the following steps to create and start a pipeline with the API:

1. Call [List source providers](#list-source-providers) and [List destination providers](#list-destination-providers) to retrieve the provider names available in your workspace.
   
2. Call [List source objects](#list-source-objects) and [List source object fields](#list-source-object-fields) to review the data available from your source connection. You can retrieve connection IDs with the [List connections](/en/workato-api/connections#list-connections) endpoint.
   
3. Call [Create a data pipeline](#create-a-data-pipeline) with the source and destination providers and connection IDs.
   
4. Call [Get configuration schema](#get-configuration-schema) to retrieve the configuration fields and default values for the source, destination, or an object. Include your configuration values in the `input` field to validate them.
   
5. Call [Update a data pipeline](#update-a-data-pipeline) to save your `source_config` and `destination_config` values.
   
6. Call [Start a data pipeline](#start-a-data-pipeline) to begin syncing.
   
7. Call [List pipeline objects](#list-pipeline-objects) and [List pipeline runs](#list-pipeline-runs) to monitor sync activity. Call [Re-sync objects](#re-sync-objects) to reload data for specific objects outside the regular schedule.
   

## Error responses

The data pipelines API returns errors in the following formats.

### Error format

Most errors return an `errors` array. Each error includes a `code` and a `title` that describes the error, and can include `detail` and `reason` fields:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 404,
      "title": "Not found"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Unauthorized and parameter errors

`401` errors and requests with a missing or invalid parameter return a `message` field that describes the error instead of an `errors` array. The response uses the `errors` array instead if several required parameters are missing. These responses can also include `details` and `reason` fields:

```json
{
  "message": "Unauthorized"
}
```

### Error codes

The data pipelines API returns the following error codes:

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | Bad request. The request is invalid or the operation failed, such as when a pipeline can't be started or a run doesn't exist. |
| 401 | Unauthorized. The API token is invalid or missing, the API client doesn't have the required privileges, or the API client can't access the folder that contains the resource. |
| 404 | The data pipeline, connection, or source object doesn't exist. |
| 422 | Validation error. Returned by the create and update endpoints. |
| 429 | Too many requests. The rate limit is exceeded. The `Retry-After` response header indicates when you can retry. |
| 500 | Internal server error. The `title` includes an error ID. |

The delete, start, stop, and re-sync endpoints return `{"success": true}` when the operation succeeds and a `400` error when it fails.

Refer to [HTTP response codes](/en/workato-api#http-response-codes) for more information.

## Pipelines

Use the following endpoints to create, update, and control data pipelines.

### List data pipelines

Returns a list of data pipelines in the environment your API client belongs to, sorted by ID in ascending order. The response includes only pipelines in folders your API client can access.

<api-code no-copy-method>

```
GET https://YOUR_DATA_CENTER/api/data_pipelines
```

</api-code>

#### Query parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| folder\_id | **integer** _optional_ | Returns pipelines in the folder you specify. |
| since\_id | **integer** _optional_ | Returns pipelines with an ID greater than the value you specify. To fetch the next page, set this value to the highest `id` in the previous response. This differs from `since_id` in the [Recipes API](/en/workato-api/recipes#list-recipes-belonging-to-user-query-parameters), which returns IDs lower than the value you provide. |
| per\_page | **integer** _optional_ | Number of pipelines to return per page. Defaults to `100`. Maximum is `100`. |
