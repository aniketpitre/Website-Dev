# Developer API - Tag assignments

Use this endpoint to apply tags to or remove tags from assets in your workspace.

> To create, retrieve, update, and delete tags programmatically, refer to our [Environment management](/en/workato-api/environment-management) API documentation.

## Rate limits

Tag assignment resources have the following rate limits:

| Type | Resource | Quota |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All | All [Tag assignments](/en/workato-api/tag-assignments.html) endpoints | 60 requests per minute |

### Quick reference

| Type | Resource | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | [/api/tags\_assignments](#manage-tag-assignments) | Apply tags to or remove tags from assets in your workspace. |

## Manage tag assignments

Applies or removes tags from assets in your workspace. This endpoint can tag recipes and connections only. You can assign one or more tags to these assets or remove existing tags.

<api-code no-copy-method>

```
POST https://YOUR_DATA_CENTER/api/tags_assignments
```

</api-code>

### Payload

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| add\_tags | **array of strings** _optional_ | An array of tag handles to be added, for example `tag-Abx8kQ2e-Tn4WzR-CD`. Use the tag handle, not the tag title. Each handle represents an existing tag to be applied to the specified assets. |
| remove\_tags | **array of strings** _optional_ | An array of tag handles to be removed. Each handle represents a tag to be removed from the specified assets. |
| recipe\_ids | **array of integers** _conditional_ | An array of recipe IDs to tag or untag. **Required** if `connection_ids` is not provided. |
| connection\_ids | **array of integers** _conditional_ | An array of connection IDs to tag or untag. **Required** if `recipe_ids` is not provided. |

> **USE TAG HANDLES, NOT TAG TITLES**
> 
> This endpoint accepts tag handles only, and a tag must exist before you can assign it. Retrieve the handle of an existing tag with the [List tags](/en/workato-api/environment-management#list-tags) (`GET /api/tags`) endpoint or [Create a tag](/en/workato-api/environment-management#create-a-tag) (`POST /api/tags`), which returns the tag `handle`.
> 
> The request returns `200 OK` and doesn't apply a tag when a value in `add_tags` or `remove_tags` doesn't match an existing tag handle. The response doesn't include an error. A request with both valid and unrecognized values applies the valid handles and ignores invalid input.

A tag is available in all environments of your workspace. Tag assignments apply only to the recipes and connections in the environment associated with your API client.

Refer to [Create and assign a tag](#create-and-assign-a-tag) for a complete example that creates a tag, assigns it to a recipe, and verifies the result.

### Sample request

This request adds a tag to a connection and a recipe in Workato.

<api-code>

```shell
curl  -X POST "https://YOUR_DATA_CENTER/api/tags_assignments" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_token>" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
            "add_tags": [":add_tag_1"],
            "recipe_ids": [:recipe_id_1],
            "connection_ids": [:connection_id_1]
          }'
```

</api-code>

### Response

A `200 OK` status means Workato accepted the request. No content is returned in the response body.

The endpoint also returns `200 OK` when a tag handle isn't recognized, so a `200 OK` status doesn't confirm that the tag was applied. Refer to [Create and assign a tag](#create-and-assign-a-tag) for an example of retrieving the tags assigned to an asset.

### Create and assign a tag

This example creates a tag, assigns it to a recipe, and confirms the assignment. Use `connection_ids` in place of `recipe_ids` to tag a connection.

1. Create the tag with the `POST /api/tags` endpoint. The `title` field is the only required field.
   
   <api-code>

   ```shell
   curl  -X POST "https://YOUR_DATA_CENTER/api/tags" \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_token>" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{
               "title": "HR"
             }'
   ```

   </api-code>
   
   Copy the `handle` value from the response. The handle in this example is `tag-Abx8sFmg-NWx3Lb-CD`. The `description` is `null` because the request doesn't set one, and Workato assigns a random `color`.
   
   ```json
   {
     "data": {
       "handle": "tag-Abx8sFmg-NWx3Lb-CD",
       "title": "HR",
       "description": null,
       "color": "plum"
     }
   }
   ```
   
2. Assign the tag to the recipe by passing the handle from the previous step in `add_tags`, not the title `HR`.
   
   <api-code>

   ```shell
   curl  -X POST "https://YOUR_DATA_CENTER/api/tags_assignments" \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_token>" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{
               "add_tags": ["tag-Abx8sFmg-NWx3Lb-CD"],
               "recipe_ids": [1234567]
             }'
   ```

   </api-code>
   
3. Verify the assignment by listing the tags assigned to the recipe with the `q[recipe_id_eq]` query parameter of the [List tags](/en/workato-api/environment-management#list-tags) endpoint. The response includes the tag if the assignment succeeded.
   
   <api-code>

   ```shell
   curl  -X GET "https://YOUR_DATA_CENTER/api/tags?q[recipe_id_eq]=1234567" \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_token>"
   ```

   </api-code>
   
   ```json
   {
     "data": {
       "tags": [
         {
           "handle": "tag-Abx8sFmg-NWx3Lb-CD",
           "title": "HR",
           "description": null,
           "color": "plum",
           "created_at": "2026-10-14T09:11:17.344-07:00",
           "updated_at": "2026-10-14T09:11:17.344-07:00"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```
   
   An empty `tags` array means the tag wasn't applied. Check that `add_tags` contains the tag handle and not the title.
