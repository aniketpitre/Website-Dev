# Developer API - Jobs

Use the following endpoints to manage recipe jobs.

## Quick reference

| Type | Resource | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | [/api/recipes/:recipe\_id/jobs](#list-jobs-from-a-recipe) | List jobs from a recipe. |
| GET | [/api/recipes/:recipe\_id/jobs/:job\_handle](#get-a-job) | Returns a single job's metadata. |
| POST | [/api/job/resume](#job-resume) | Resumes a particular job based on the `resume_token` you provide. This endpoint returns HTTP status code `204`, indicating successful request processing without any content included in the response. This endpoint is leveraged by [SDK Wait for resume actions](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/guides/building-actions/wait-for-resume-actions). |
| POST | [/api/recipes/:recipe\_id/repeat\_jobs](#repeat-jobs) | Repeats jobs you specify. |
| POST | [/api/recipes/:recipe\_id/cancel\_jobs](#cancel-jobs) | Cancels ongoing jobs you specify. |

## Rate limits

Job resources have the following rate limits:

| Type | Resource | Quota |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | Repeat jobs: [/api/recipes/:recipe\_id/repeat\_jobs](/en/workato-api/jobs.html#repeat-jobs) | 1 request per second |
| POST | Cancel jobs: [/api/recipes/:recipe\_id/cancel\_jobs](/en/workato-api/jobs.html#cancel-jobs) | 1 request per second |
| All | All other [Jobs](/en/workato-api/jobs.html) endpoints | 60 requests per minute |

Additionally, [Repeat jobs](#repeat-jobs) and [Cancel jobs](#cancel-jobs) have the following payload quota:

| Type | Resource | Quota |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | Repeat jobs: [/api/recipes/:recipe\_id/repeat\_jobs](/en/workato-api/jobs.html#repeat-jobs) | 25 jobs per request |
| POST | Cancel jobs: [/api/recipes/:recipe\_id/cancel\_jobs](/en/workato-api/jobs.html#cancel-jobs) | 25 jobs per request |

## List jobs from a recipe

Returns aggregated job information as well as detailed job information for a specified recipe in Workato.

<api-code no-copy-method>

```
GET https://YOUR_DATA_CENTER/api/recipes/:recipe_id/jobs
```

</api-code>

  

> **Run-time data not available**
> 
> Run-time data is the data that flows through the recipe at the time of job execution. This includes the input and output data from individual steps.
> 
> This data is available through the [Get a job](#get-a-job) endpoint or the [job details page](/en/recipes/jobs#viewing-job-reports) on the Workato platform.

> **REPEAT JOBS ARE GROUPED BY CHAIN**
> 
> This endpoint returns one row per repeat chain. Each row represents the most recent repeat in the chain. The list excludes the original job and any intermediate repeats.
> 
> You can use the [Get a job](#get-a-job) endpoint with the corresponding job ID to retrieve the original job or an intermediate repeat.

### Path parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| recipe\_id | **integer** _required_ | Recipe ID. |

### Query parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| offset\_job\_id | **string** _optional_ | The ID of the job to paginate from. The endpoint returns up to 1,000 jobs before or after this point, depending on the `prev` parameter. You can obtain a job ID from the response of this endpoint or the [Jobs](/en/recipes/jobs#job-metadata-and-statuses) page in Workato. |
| prev | **boolean** _optional_ | Defaults to `false`. When `prev=false`, this call returns jobs completed prior to the `offset_job_id`. If `prev=true`, jobs newer than the `offset_job_id` are returned. |
| status | **string** _optional_ | Filter by status - `succeeded`, `failed` or `pending`. |
| rerun\_only | **boolean** _optional_ | If `true`, returns jobs that were rerun only. |
| offset\_run\_id | **integer** _(deprecated)_ | Offset run ID. This parameter has been deprecated. |
| failed | **boolean** _(deprecated)_ | If `true`, returns failed jobs only. This parameter has been deprecated. |

## Resume a job

Resumes a particular job based on the `resume_token` you provide. This endpoint returns HTTP status code `204`, indicating successful request processing without any content included in the response.

This endpoint is invoked by third-party apps when using [SDK Wait for resume actions](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/guides/building-actions/wait-for-resume-actions).

<api-code no-copy-method>

```
POST https://YOUR_DATA_CENTER/api/job/resume
```

</api-code>

### Request body

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| token | **string** _required_ | The `resume_token` that matches the particular job you plan to resume. |
| data | **hash** _optional_ | Any contextual data you plan to pass back to the job. This data is accessible by the action in the `before_resume` lambda. The payload's quota is 50MB. For payloads larger than the quota, you can send a reference and allow the action’s `execute` lambda to make a secondary request to retrieve the data. |

### Sample request

<api-code>

```shell
curl -X POST https://YOUR_DATA_CENTER/api/job/resume \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "token": ":token",
       "data": :data
     }'
```

</api-code>

## Repeat jobs

Repeats jobs you specify by their master job ID. Repeats use the latest recipe version.

<api-code no-copy-method>

```
POST https://YOUR_DATA_CENTER/api/recipes/:recipe_id/repeat_jobs
```

</api-code>

  

> **LIMITATIONS**
> 
> The **Repeat jobs** endpoint has the following limitations:
> 
> - You can only repeat jobs that are within the retention period. You can't repeat jobs in recipes that don't retain trigger event data. Refer to [Data retention policies](/en/security/data-protection/data-retention/#basics) for more information.
> - You can repeat a maximum of 25 jobs in each request.
> - You can repeat each job a maximum of 100 times.
> - You can only repeat jobs using the master job ID, not the ID of a previous repeat.

### Path parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| recipe\_id | **string** _required_ | The ID of the recipe to repeat jobs in. |

### Request body

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| job\_ids | **array** _required_ | Contains the IDs of master jobs to repeat. You can retrieve a `master_job_id` using the [List jobs from a recipe](#list-jobs-from-a-recipe) endpoint or the [Jobs](/en/recipes/jobs#job-metadata-and-statuses) page in Workato. |

### Sample request

<api-code>

            ]
          }'
```

</api-code>

### Response

200 OK

A `200 OK` status indicates the request was processed successfully. Check the `results` array for the status of each job and the `summary` for totals.
