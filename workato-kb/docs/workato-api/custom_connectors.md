> Reference for the Workato custom connectors API to create, search, update, validate, release, and share connectors and generate schema from JSON or CSV.

# Developer API - Custom connectors

The following endpoints allow you to create and manage custom connectors, validate connector code for syntax and semantic errors, and generate a [Workato Schema](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/schema) from sample JSON and CSV documents. The schema generation endpoints are also used in the SDK CLI tool for [schema generation commands](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/cli/reference/cli-commands#workato-generate-schema).

## Rate limits

Custom connector resources have the following rate limits:

| Type | Resource | Quota |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | Generate schema from JSON: [/api/sdk/generate\_schema /json](/en/workato-api/custom_connectors.html#generate-schema-from-json) | 60 requests per minute |
| POST | Generate schema from CSV: [/api/sdk/generate\_schema /csv](/en/workato-api/custom_connectors.html) | 60 requests per minute |
| All | All other [Custom connectors](/en/workato-api/custom_connectors.html) endpoints | 1 request per second |

The following additional limitations apply to custom connector resources:

| Description | Quota |
| --- | --- |
| Maximum data allowed in custom connector code | 10 MB |
| Compatible code formats | UTF-8 and JSON compatible |
