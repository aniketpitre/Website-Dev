# Upload a connector to the community library

You can upload a connector to the community library if you plan to share it with other users.

> **REQUIRED PERMISSIONS**
> 
> Uploading connectors to the community library requires [full access to the Connector SDK](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/privileges-reference#connector-sdk). If you don't have the required permissions, contact your workspace admin to help you upload the connector to the community library.

Complete the following steps to share a connector to the community library:

1. Go to **Tools > Connector SDK**.
   
2. Select the connector you plan to share.
   
   ![Click the connector](/assets/select-connector.D5e_JOdb.png)_Click the connector you plan to upload_
   
3. Go to the **Share** tab, then click **Share version**.
   
   ![Click Share version](/assets/share-connector.DGSlq1R0.png)_Click **Share version**_
   
4. Optional. Click the **Make source code hidden** button if you plan to publish a closed-source connector. This ensures your connector code isn't visible or editable by others. You can't change this setting after publishing unless you unpublish the connector.
   
   ![Choose to hide your source code](/assets/change-source-code-hidden.BY45Q0of.png)_Choose to hide your source code_
   
5. Click **Edit** in the connector description and ensure the description includes a clear way for users to contact support, such as a support email, documentation link, or help center. Submissions without support contact information may be rejected during review.

6. Click **Publish connector** to open the **List on community library** dialog.
   
   ![Click Publish connector](/assets/publish-connector.DwV2kuQB.png)_Click **Publish connector**_
   
7. Enter the **App** name. This field is case-sensitive.

8. Select any relevant tags in the **Category tags** drop-down menu.
   
9. Enter up to three **Search keywords**, separated by commas.
   
10. Optional. Click the **Prevent direct installation** toggle if you plan to redirect visitors to a landing page to request access.
    
    The following occurs when this option is enabled:
    
    - End users can't install the connector directly from the community listing.
    - Users can install the connector only through your private sharing link. Go to the **Sharing privately using a link** section of your connector's **Share** tab to obtain the link. Refer to [Share a connector with a link](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/quickstart/sharing#closed-source-code) to learn how to grant access to users.
    - You must provide a **Landing Page URL** and a clear path.
    
    Any workspace can install the connector directly from the community listing if you don't enable this toggle. Closed-source connectors hide the source code but don't restrict installation.
    
11. Provide a **Landing Page URL** if you enabled **Prevent direct installation**. The page you link to should showcase the connector and provide a clear path on how to obtain the private sharing link of the connector.
    
12. Read the Workato developer agreement and click the checkbox to accept the terms and conditions.

13. Click **List connector** to submit your connector for review.
    
14. Workato notifies you through your community profile's email when your connector has been reviewed.
