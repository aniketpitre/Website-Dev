> Create and manage end-user groups in Workato Identity, assign environment access, and scope user access more securely across your workspace.

# End-user group management

Workato Identity enables you to create and manage end-user groups. You can store end-users and end-user groups with customized environment access and assign access to specific groups. This lets you scope user access more securely.

You can also enable [user group syncing](/en/workato-identity/user-group-syncing) to automatically update user group memberships in Workato based on group information from your identity provider.

## End-user groups

End-user groups are created within specific environments. You must [add end-users to your external IdP](/en/workato-identity/identity-provider-user-access) or [add end-users manually](/en/workato-identity/add-end-user-manually) before you can assign them to a user group. Each end-user group must have at least one end user assigned to it.

### Create an end-user group

End-user groups are specific to each environment. You must select the environment before you can create a group.

> **ENVIRONMENT AVAILABILITY**
> 
> Workspaces without [Environments](/en/features/environments) provisioned only have one environment available.

Complete the following steps to create an end-user group in an environment:

1. Sign in to Workato.
   
2. Click **Workspace admin** in the sidebar. The **Access control** page displays by default.
   
3. Click **Authentication & Groups** in the sidebar.
   
4. Select the environment where you plan to create a group. The environment **End-user group** page displays by default.

### Grant access to users and groups

You can provide individual users and groups with feature access.

Complete the following steps grant access to users and groups:

1. Sign in to Workato.

   - Go to **AI Hub > Agent Studio**, select the genie, and go to **End user access**.
   - Go to **AI Hub > Enterprise MCP > Custom servers**, select the MCP server, and go to **Settings > End user access**.
3. Click **Add end users**.
   
4. Select the individual users or groups you plan to provide with feature access.
