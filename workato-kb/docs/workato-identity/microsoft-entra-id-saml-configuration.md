# Microsoft Entra ID SAML configuration

This guide describes how to configure Microsoft Entra ID as a SAML identity provider (IdP) for Workato Identity.

SAML enables secure authentication between an IdP, such as Microsoft Entra ID, and a service provider like Workato. Users authenticate once through Microsoft Entra ID and gain access to Workato with a single login instead of managing separate credentials for each application. Refer to Microsoft Entra ID [SAML-based authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-pages/security/authentication/saml2-settings-azure-ad) documentation for more information.

> **PREREQUISITES**
