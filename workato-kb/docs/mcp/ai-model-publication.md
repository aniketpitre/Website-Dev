2. Go to your repository root and create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file with the following code:
   
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "snowflake-tools": {
         "url": "https://2255.apim.mcp.workato.com?wkt_token=YOUR_API_TOKEN"
       },

       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
3. Commit the `.cursor/mcp.json` file to your repository. This ensures all project team members can access the MCP server tools.

Complete the following steps to connect to a project-wide MCP server in Cursor:

1. Pull the latest changes from your repository to ensure you have the `.cursor/mcp.json` file locally.

   - **OAuth**: Cursor prompts you to authenticate on first use.
5. Restart Cursor to load the new configuration in the `.cursor/mcp.json` file.
