> Configure MCP verified user access by setting up Workato Identity, end-user groups, and OAuth 2.0 end user tool connections.

# MCP verified user access configuration

MCP [verified user access](/en/mcp/verified-user-access) requires the following configuration:

- Workato Identity access method with assigned end user groups.
  
- End user tool connection with OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant.
  

Refer to [Create an SDK connection for MCP verified user access](/en/developing-connectors/sdk/guides/walkthrough#create-an-sdk-connection-for-mcp-verified-user-access) if you plan to use the [Connector SDK](/en/developing-connectors/sdk) with MCP verified user access.

## Workato Identity configuration

Complete the following steps to configure Workato Identity for MCP verified user access:

1. [Configure SAML-based authentication](/en/workato-identity/saml-sso#configure-saml-based-authentication).
   
2. [Configure IdP user access](/en/workato-identity/saml-sso#configure-idp-user-access).
   
3. [Create an end-user group](/en/workato-identity/user-groups#create-a-user-group).
   

## MCP Workato Identity access method and end-user group configuration
