# GitHub MCP server

The GitHub MCP server lets LLMs explore and manage information in GitHub repositories, issues, and pull requests. It provides tools to help users understand codebases, track development progress, monitor project health, and take action, such as create and update issues and pull requests, through natural conversation.

## Uses

Use the GitHub MCP server when you plan to perform the following actions:

- Explore repositories and understand project structure and activity
- Check the status of issues and pull requests
- Create new issues and pull requests
- Update existing issues and pull requests
- Add comments to issues for feedback and collaboration
- List available labels for consistent issue categorization
- Prepare for code reviews or development discussions
- Review recent commits and development changes
- Search across repositories for issues, pull requests, code, or projects
- Get situational awareness of development activity or personal workload
- Request reviewers and manage pull request metadata

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke GitHub MCP server tools:

- `What's the status of the authentication-service repo?`
- `Give me a development summary for our platform repository`
- `What's been happening in the api-gateway repo this week?`
- `How active is the mobile-app repository? Any open PRs?`
- `Summarize recent activity in acme-corp/backend-services`
- `Create a bug report for the login timeout issue in the backend-api repo`
- `Update issue #234 to high priority and assign it to Sarah`
- `Add a comment to issue #456 with the latest test results`
- `Create a pull request from feature/new-auth to main`
- `Add reviewers to PR #789 and mark it ready for review`
- `What labels are available in the mobile-app repository?`

- GitHub Apps. Workato recipes act as the app. Refer to [GitHub App authentication](#github-app-authentication) .
- A personal access token

Refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps) for more information.

### OAuth authentication

View OAuth authentication steps

Complete the following steps to connect your GitHub to Workato using OAuth authentication:

1. Sign in to your Workato account and go to the project where you plan to add your GitHub connection.
   
2. Click **Create > Connection** (or press C twice), then select **GitHub** as your connection.
   
3. Provide a **Connection name** that identifies which GitHub instance Workato is connected to.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Use the **Authentication type** drop-down menu and select **OAuth App**.
   
6. Optional. Click **Advanced configuration** to display the **Host name** field.
