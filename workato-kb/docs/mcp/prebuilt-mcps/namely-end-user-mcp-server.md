> Use the Namely End User MCP server to connect your LLM to Namely with a curated set of tools to check PTO balances, look up a colleague's contact information, review your own profile, or check on your team's time-off status.

# Namely End User MCP server

The Namely End User MCP server provides self-service, identity-scoped access to HR and directory information for individual employees and managers through natural conversation.

The Namely End User MCP server provides tools to check PTO balances, look up a colleague's contact information, review your own profile, or check on your team's time-off status if you're a manager.
