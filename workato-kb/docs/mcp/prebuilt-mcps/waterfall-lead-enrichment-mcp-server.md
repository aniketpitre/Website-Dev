> Use the Waterfall Lead Enrichment MCP server to connect your LLM to ZoomInfo, Apollo.io, and LeadIQ with confidence-scored, auditable lead enrichment through natural conversation.

# Waterfall Lead Enrichment MCP server

The Waterfall Lead Enrichment MCP server enables LLMs to enrich lead records with ZoomInfo, Apollo.io, and LeadIQ through natural conversation. It provides tools to run an enrichment waterfall across all three providers, call a single provider directly, merge results into a confidence-scored lead, and review a merged record in an [MCP app](/en/mcp/mcp-apps) before storing it.

## Uses

Use the Waterfall Lead Enrichment MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Enrich a lead by running the full waterfall across ZoomInfo, Apollo.io, and LeadIQ in that order, and merging the results into one confidence-scored record
- Enrich a lead through a single named provider without running the full waterfall
- Look up a lead by email or LinkedIn URL, and optionally add a name or company to improve match accuracy
- Override the default provider priority for the whole merged record or for individual fields
- Re-enrich a lead whose previous enrichment result is no longer available

Additionally, use the server's built-in [Waterfall Lead Enrichment MCP app](#waterfall-lead-enrichment-mcp-app) to review and edit results.

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Waterfall Lead Enrichment MCP server tools:

- `Enrich this lead: ariel@example.com.`
- `Run the full enrichment waterfall for jade@example.com.`
- `Enrich this contact using only ZoomInfo.`
- `Look up this lead in Apollo.io: dana@example.com.`
- `Get this person's mobile number from LeadIQ.`
- `Enrich the lead at this LinkedIn URL: linkedin.com/in/example-name.`
- `Why did this lead come back as low confidence?`
- `Enrich this lead and use company name and domain to improve the match: Acme Corp, acme.com.`
- `Show me the confidence score and providers used for this enriched lead.`
- `Re-enrich this lead. The last enrichment result expired.`

## Waterfall Lead Enrichment MCP server tools

The Waterfall Lead Enrichment MCP server provides the following tools:

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [enrich\_via\_zoominfo](#enrich-via-zoominfo-tool) | Calls ZoomInfo to enrich a lead by email or LinkedIn URL and writes the normalized result to the shared enrichment record. |
| [enrich\_via\_apollo](#enrich-via-apollo-tool) | Calls Apollo.io to enrich a lead by email or LinkedIn URL and writes the normalized result to the shared enrichment record. |
| [enrich\_via\_leadiq](#enrich-via-leadiq-tool) | Calls LeadIQ to enrich a lead by email or LinkedIn URL and writes the normalized result to the shared enrichment record. |
| [enrich\_lead](#enrich-lead-tool) | Merges the ZoomInfo, Apollo.io, and LeadIQ results for a lead into one confidence-scored record and evaluates it against the enrichment threshold, without calling the provider APIs itself. |

Don't call the `manage_enriched_lead_data` tool directly. The [Waterfall Lead Enrichment MCP app](#waterfall-lead-enrichment-mcp-app) uses it to fetch, normalize, and store records on your behalf.

## How to use Waterfall Lead Enrichment MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools. All three provider tools accept a first name, last name, company name, or company domain to speed up or improve the match, and a provider error or missing match contributes a null result instead of stopping the waterfall.

### enrich\_via\_zoominfo tool

The **enrich\_via\_zoominfo** tool calls ZoomInfo to enrich a lead by email or LinkedIn URL and writes the normalized result to the shared enrichment record. Your LLM calls this tool first in a waterfall enrichment, or calls it alone and returns the result directly when you name ZoomInfo specifically.

**Try asking**:

- `Enrich this lead: ariel@example.com.`
- `Look up this contact in ZoomInfo only.`
- `Run the full enrichment waterfall for this lead.`
- `Enrich this lead in ZoomInfo and add company name and domain to improve the match: Acme Corp, acme.com.`

### enrich\_via\_apollo tool

The **enrich\_via\_apollo** tool calls Apollo.io to enrich a lead by email or LinkedIn URL and writes the normalized result to the shared enrichment record. Your LLM calls this tool second in a waterfall enrichment, after **enrich\_via\_zoominfo**, or calls it alone and returns the result directly when you name Apollo.io specifically.

**Try asking**:

- `Get this lead's details from Apollo.io only.`
- `Enrich dana@example.com using Apollo.io.`
- `Run the enrichment waterfall for this contact.`
- `Enrich this lead in Apollo.io and add a first and last name to improve the match.`

### enrich\_via\_leadiq tool

The **enrich\_via\_leadiq** tool calls LeadIQ to enrich a lead by email or LinkedIn URL and writes the normalized result to the shared enrichment record. Your LLM calls this tool third in a waterfall enrichment, after **enrich\_via\_zoominfo** and **enrich\_via\_apollo**, or calls it alone and returns the result directly when you name LeadIQ specifically.

**Try asking**:

- `Find this person's mobile number through LeadIQ.`
- `Enrich this lead using only LeadIQ.`
- `What's this contact's job title according to LinkedIn?`
- `Enrich this lead in LeadIQ and add the company name to improve the match: Acme Corp.`

### enrich\_lead tool

The **enrich\_lead** tool merges the ZoomInfo, Apollo.io, and LeadIQ results for a lead into one confidence-scored record and evaluates it against the enrichment threshold, without calling the provider APIs itself. Your LLM calls this tool last, after all three provider tools have run with the same email or LinkedIn URL, and only when you haven't named a specific provider. The [Waterfall Lead Enrichment MCP app](#waterfall-lead-enrichment-mcp-app) opens for review after the tool returns.

Enrichment threshold and record status

The enrichment threshold is a confidence-score cutoff that contributes to a record's status. Records can have the following statuses:

- `enriched`: The score meets the threshold and all required fields are present.
- `low_confidence`: The score falls short or a required field is missing.
- `not_found`: No provider returned a match.

Default field-level merge precedence

Each field falls back to a default winning provider unless you override it:

| Field | Default winning provider |
| --- | --- |
| `work_email` | ZoomInfo |
| `direct_phone` | ZoomInfo |
| `mobile_phone` | LeadIQ |
| `job_title` | LeadIQ (LinkedIn-sourced) |
| `company_name` | ZoomInfo |
| `company_size` | ZoomInfo |
| `seniority_level` | Inferred from `job_title` |
| All other fields | First non-null value found during the waterfall |

**Try asking**:

- `Merge the provider results and give me the enriched lead.`
- `Enrich this lead and prioritize LeadIQ over ZoomInfo for the phone number.`
- `What's the confidence score and status for this lead?`
- `Why did this lead come back as low confidence?`

## Waterfall Lead Enrichment MCP app

The Waterfall Lead Enrichment [MCP app](/en/mcp/mcp-apps) opens for review after `enrich_lead` returns. It displays the results from each provider, the merged enrichment record, and a normalized version of the merged record so you can review and modify each value. Accept the record to store it back to the shared enrichment record.

> **RECORD RETENTION PERIOD**
> 
> The server automatically deletes stored enrichment records after 30 days, so a lead whose previous result has expired needs re-enrichment.
