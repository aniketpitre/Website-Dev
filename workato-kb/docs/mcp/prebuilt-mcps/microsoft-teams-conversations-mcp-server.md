# Microsoft Teams Conversations MCP server

The Microsoft Teams Conversations MCP server enables LLMs to search, retrieve, and participate in Microsoft Teams conversations through natural conversation. It provides tools to find topics, projects, or customers, retrieve message history, get thread context, list teams, channels, and chats, and post messages or replies without requiring direct interaction with the Microsoft Teams interface.

## Uses

Use the Microsoft Teams Conversations MCP server to perform the following actions:

- List Microsoft Teams teams the authenticated user is a member of
- List channels within a specified Microsoft Teams team
- List one-on-one, group, and meeting chats the user participates in
- Retrieve messages and thread replies from a Microsoft Teams channel or chat
- Search for messages matching a keyword across Microsoft Teams channels and chats
- Post a new message to a Microsoft Teams channel or chat
- Reply to an existing message thread in a Microsoft Teams channel

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Microsoft Teams Conversations MCP server tools:

- `Which Microsoft Teams teams am I a member of?`
- `What channels are available in the Sales team?`
- `Show me my recent Microsoft Teams chats.`
- `Get the last 20 messages from the #general channel.`
- `Find discussions about the Acme renewal across my Microsoft Teams conversations.`
- `Search for any messages about the Q2 launch plan.`
- `Post a message to the #announcements channel.`
