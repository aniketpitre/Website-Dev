# Microsoft Word MCP server

The Microsoft Word MCP server enables LLMs to create, read, update, and collaborate on Word documents through natural conversation. It provides tools to author content, apply edits, manage comments, surface tracked changes, and create documents from templates without requiring direct interaction with the Word interface.

## Uses

Use the Microsoft Word MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Create new Word documents with optional titles and initial content
- Create documents from existing Word templates
- Retrieve document metadata and revision identifiers
- Get structured content and metadata from documents
- Find document blocks by text or structural criteria
- Apply block-level updates to documents with revision safety
- Add comments to documents and associate them with specific content blocks
- List comment threads with filtering and pagination
- Reply to existing comment threads
- Resolve or close comment threads
- List pending tracked changes with authorship information

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Microsoft Word MCP server tools:

- `Create a new Word document for the project proposal.`
- `Make a document from the quarterly report template.`
- `What's in the marketing plan document?`
- `Find the Executive Summary section in this document.`
- `Update the budget section to reflect the new numbers.`
- `Add a comment to the intro paragraph about tone.`
- `What comments are on the proposal document?`
- `Reply to Jade's comment about the timeline.`
- `Resolve all comments from Marco.`

## Install the Microsoft Word MCP server

Complete the following steps to install a prebuilt MCP server to your project:

1. Sign in to your Workato account.
   
2. Go to **AI Hub > Enterprise MCP > Custom servers**.
   
3. Click **\+ Create MCP server**.
   
4. Go to the **Start with pre-built MCP Servers using your connected apps** section and select the prebuilt MCP server you plan to use.
   
5. Click **Use this server**.
   
6. Provide a name for your MCP server in the **Server name** field.

> We strongly recommend enabling MFA now for all Microsoft accounts used with Workato to avoid service disruptions from short-notice enforcement changes.
> 
> Complete the following steps to maintain uninterrupted service:
> 
> 1. Enable MFA for your Microsoft organization following the Microsoft MFA setup guide. Refer to [Set up multifactor authentication for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide) for more information.
>    
> 2. Reconnect your Microsoft connection in Workato.
>    
> 3. Complete the OAuth flow with MFA when prompted.
>    
> 4. Test your recipes to ensure they work with the updated connection.
