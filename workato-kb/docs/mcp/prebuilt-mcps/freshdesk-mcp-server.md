- List tickets with filters for company, requester, status, priority, and assignee
- View tickets assigned to you
- Monitor overdue tickets and SLA compliance
- Find unassigned tickets for triage
- Create new support tickets
- Update ticket fields such as status, priority, and assignee
- Add public replies or private notes to tickets

### Example prompts

- `What's the status of ticket #12345?`
- `Show me the conversation on ticket #789.`
- `Find tickets about login failures.`
- `Show me open tickets for Acme Corp.`
- `What's in my queue?`
