> Use the Post Meeting Actions MCP server to connect your LLM to Salesforce, Gong, Zoom, Gmail, and Outlook to process a completed sales call end-to-end, from transcript retrieval to a confirmed Salesforce update and follow-up email.

# Post Meeting Actions MCP server

The Post Meeting Actions MCP server enables LLMs to interact with Salesforce, Gong, Zoom, Gmail, and Outlook for processing a completed sales call end-to-end through natural conversation. It provides tools to retrieve the Salesforce record and call transcript, generate a summary in your configured sales methodology, and write it to Salesforce, with resource lookup and a follow-up email available on request. Each deployment implements only the tools for its configured transcript source and configured email platform.

## Uses

Use the Post Meeting Actions MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Process a completed sales call end-to-end: Find the Salesforce record, retrieve the call transcript, generate a summary, and write it to Salesforce
- Find the Salesforce Opportunity related to a call or meeting
- Retrieve a call transcript from Gong or Zoom
- Search within a call's transcript for a specific mention or topic without regenerating the whole summary
- Generate a call summary structured to your org's configured sales methodology
- Check which sales methodology and Salesforce fields this deployment is configured to write to
- Write a summary to Salesforce as Opportunity fields and a Task
- Retrieve relevant customer stories or product resources to support a follow-up
- Draft and send a follow-up email to a prospect through Gmail or Outlook
- Check which of your calls have outstanding summarization, writing, or follow-up steps

   ![Select your connection type](/assets/connection-type.Cor-6PJN.png)_Select your connection type_
   
   > **VERIFIED USER ACCESS AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENTS**
   > 
   > Only app connections that use OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant are available for user's connection. Refer to [Verified user access](/en/mcp/verified-user-access) for more information.
   
10. Complete the app-specific connection setup steps in the following section.
    

## Post Meeting Actions connection setup

Configure the following connections to set up the Post Meeting Actions MCP server:

- [Salesforce](#salesforce-connection): Required.
- [Gong](#gong-connection): Optional. Connect to Gong to retrieve Gong-sourced call transcripts.
- [Zoom](#zoom-connection): Optional. Connect to Zoom to retrieve Zoom-sourced call transcripts.
- [Gmail](#gmail-connection): Optional. Connect to Gmail to draft and send follow-up emails through Gmail.
- [Outlook](#outlook-connection): Optional. Connect to Outlook to draft and send follow-up emails through Outlook.

### Post Meeting Actions role requirements

Each tool's availability depends on the permissions granted to its connected account:

- **[Salesforce](#salesforce-connection)**: Requires write access to the `Task` object and to each field listed in `salesforce_fields_allowed_to_update`, and create access to `ContentVersion` when `write_content_note` is enabled. A missing permission returns a `permission_denied` outcome rather than a partial result.
- **[Gong](#gong-connection)**: Requires access to basic call metadata and the transcript body. A connection missing the transcript scope still returns call metadata and Gong's own summary.
- **[Zoom](#zoom-connection)**: Requires access to transcripts and AI-generated meeting summaries. A connection missing the summary scope still returns the transcript.
- **[Gmail](#gmail-connection) and [Outlook](#outlook-connection)**: Requires access to draft and send email on behalf of the connected mailbox.

##### Salesforce OAuth 2.0 authentication

View OAuth 2.0 authentication steps

#### Connect to Salesforce using OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Grant)

Complete the following steps to set up an OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Grant) connection to Salesforce in Workato:

> **OAUTH RESTRICTIONS**
> 
> As of early September 2025, Salesforce restricts the use of uninstalled Salesforce Connected Apps. Refer to [OAuth restrictions](/en/connectors/salesforce#oauth-restrictions) for required actions if you encounter errors when you create a new connection. These steps are required for all new Salesforce connections starting **September 17, 2025**.

1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `Salesforce` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name in the **Connection name** field.
   
   ![Salesforce connection setup](/assets/connect.CnntY3nd.png)_OAuth2.0 Salesforce connection setup_
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Use the **Auth type** drop-down menu to select **OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Grant)**.
   
6. Use the **Sandbox** drop-down menu to specify whether the Salesforce account is a sandbox account.
   
7. Optional. Expand **Advanced settings** to configure the following options:
   
   Advanced settings
   
   - **Organization/community custom domain URL**: Enter the URL to your Salesforce community's custom domain. Required for community connections with unique domains.
   - **Requested permissions**: Select [permissions](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_oauth_scopes.htm&type=5) to request for this connection. Refer to [Requested scopes](/en/connectors/salesforce#oauth2-scopes) for the scopes Workato requests.
   - **Verified user access configuration**: Configure custom auth for personal connections. Refer to [Runtime user connections](/en/features/runtime-user-connections) for more information.
   
   > **REFRESH TOKEN SCOPE IS REQUIRED**
   > 
   > The **Perform requests at any time (`refresh_token`, `offline_access`)** scope is one of the scopes Workato requests for OAuth 2.0 connections, but whether Salesforce actually grants this scope depends on the Connected App's own OAuth policies, not on the Workato connection's settings. Refer to [Salesforce connection disconnects repeatedly](/en/connectors/salesforce/troubleshoot-connection-setup#salesforce-connection-disconnects-repeatedly) if your connection later disconnects when the access token expires. A Refresh Token Policy or IP Relaxation setting can cause the same symptom.
   
8. Optional. Use the **Custom OAuth profile** drop-down menu to select a custom OAuth profile for your connection. Refer to [Create a custom OAuth profile for Salesforce](/en/connectors/salesforce/custom-oauth) for more information.
   
9. Click **Connect**.
   
10. Optional. If your Salesforce organization or community uses a custom domain, complete the following in the sign-in modal:
    
    - Click **Use Custom Domain**.
    - Enter your **Custom domain**, then click **Continue**.
    
    ![Salesforce custom domains](/assets/connection-custom-domain.D3hJN8X8.png)_Enter your Custom domain._

    ![Salesforce connection setup](/assets/login.CIu5oc0P.png)_Log in to your Salesforce account_
    
12. Click **Log In** to complete the setup.
    
    > **OAUTH\_APPROVAL\_ERROR\_GENERIC**
    > 
    > If you see this error, Salesforce is restricting the Workato app because it isn't installed. A Salesforce admin must install the app in **Connected Apps OAuth Usage** or assign the Salesforce permissions. Refer to [OAuth restrictions](/en/connectors/salesforce#oauth-restrictions) for details.
    

##### Salesforce JWT bearer authentication

View JWT bearer authentication steps

> **ACTIONS ON BEHALF OF USER**
> 
> JWT connections can perform actions on behalf of a user you specify using the **On-behalf-of-user email** field. Contact your Workato Customer Success Manager to enable this feature.

#### How it works

JWT bearer authentication connects using a digital certificate that signs a JWT request. Workato sends a JWT to the Salesforce OAuth token endpoint, where Salesforce processes the JWT and issues an access token based on prior approval of Workato in Salesforce.

Although JWT bearer skips interactive sign-in, Salesforce still evaluates every request against the permissions of the user specified in the connection and attributes any changes to that user. Use a dedicated integration user rather than a personal account.

Refer to [Required roles and permissions](/en/connectors/salesforce#roles-and-permissions-required-to-connect) for the Salesforce permissions the connected user needs.

#### Generate a private key and certificate

JWT bearer authentication requires a private key and a certificate. The following command generates both using OpenSSL. Replace the `-subj` values with your own:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout server.key \
  -out server.crt \
  -days 365 \
  -subj "/CN=Your App Name/O=Your Organization/C=US"
```

This generates two files:

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `server.key` | Your private key for Workato. Keep this secret. |
| `server.crt` | Your public certificate for Salesforce. |

Refer to Salesforce's documentation for more information:

- [OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Flow for Server-to-Server Integration](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.remoteaccess_oauth_jwt_flow.htm&language=en_US&type=5): Details on how Salesforce uses this certificate to sign and validate JWTs.
- [Create a Private Key and Self-Signed Digital Certificate](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_key_and_cert.htm): Other ways to generate a private key and certificate.

#### Create an external client app for JWT bearer

Workato supports OAuth 2.0 authentication and Service account authentication for Gmail.

##### Gmail minimum and default scopes

The **See your primary Google Account email address** scope is required to establish a connection at a minimum.

Workato requests the following scopes by default if you don't request specific scopes:

- **See your primary Google Account email address**
- **See and edit your email labels**
- **Send email on your behalf**
- **View your email messages and settings**
- **Read, compose, and send emails from your Gmail account**

Ensure your Google Workspace Admin grants [domain-wide authority delegation](https://developers.google.com/cloud-search/docs/guides/delegation#delegate_domain-wide_authority_to_your_service_account) to your service account if you plan to use a service account to connect to Gmail. This allows it to impersonate the user email entered during connection setup, with the necessary scopes and permissions.

##### Gmail service account authentication

View Service account authentication steps

A Google service account is a specialized Google account associated with a Google Cloud Project (GCP) that can run API requests on your behalf.

Service accounts provide the following benefits:

- **Continuous operation:** Service accounts ensure that operations continue even if individual user permissions change.
- **Dedicated permissions:** Service accounts can only access projects that you share with them.
- **Dedicated API quotas:** You can manage a service account's API quotas through GCP and request quota increases directly from Google.

Refer to the [Google service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) to learn more about service accounts.

## How to use Post Meeting Actions MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools.

> **TOOL CONFIGURATION**
> 
> A deployed MCP server only exposes the tools for its `enabled_sources` and `enabled_platforms` [server configuration](#server-configuration) values. For example, a deployment configured with `gong` and `gmail` exposes `retrieve_call_transcript_gong` and the Gmail follow-up tools, not the Zoom or Outlook variants.

### find\_target\_record tool

The **find\_target\_record** tool finds the Salesforce Opportunity related to a meeting. Your LLM uses this tool to match a company or account name to a specific Opportunity. The tool uses `search_call_activities` or a transcript tool to find the company if you don't name it directly.

**Try asking**:

- `What's the Opportunity for my call with Acme?`
- `Which account does this call belong to?`
- `Find the record for my call with Acme.`

### search\_call\_activities tool

The **search\_call\_activities** tool finds Salesforce activity history for logged calls or meetings tied to an account within a date range. Your LLM uses this tool to find calls you reference.

**Try asking**:

- `Find my last call with Acme.`
- `Show me my calls with Acme last month.`
- `What calls do I have logged with Acme in the past 30 days?`
- `Find the most recent call logged against this Opportunity.`

### retrieve\_call\_transcript\_gong tool

The **retrieve\_call\_transcript\_gong** tool retrieves transcript and metadata for a Gong-sourced call by its ID. Your LLM uses this tool to retrieve a transcript after `search_call_activities` identifies a specific call. The tool resumes any prior progress on the call instead of starting over.

**Try asking**:

- `Pull the transcript from my Gong call with Acme.`
- `Get the Gong recording for this call.`
- `Summarize what was said on my last Gong call with Acme.`

### retrieve\_call\_transcript\_zoom tool

The **retrieve\_call\_transcript\_zoom** tool retrieves transcript and metadata for a Zoom-sourced call. Your LLM uses this tool to retrieve a transcript after `search_call_activities` identifies a specific call.

**Try asking**:

- `Pull the transcript from my Zoom call with Acme.`
- `Get the Zoom recording summary for this meeting.`
- `What was discussed on my Zoom call with Acme?`

### generate\_meeting\_summary tool

The **generate\_meeting\_summary** tool produces a summary mapped to the configured sales methodology. Your LLM uses this tool to generate a summary after retrieving a transcript, and only passes a different methodology if you explicitly ask for one.

**Try asking**:

- `Format my call notes using our sales methodology.`
- `Summarize this call using MEDDIC/MEDDPICC.`
- `What competitors were mentioned in my call with Acme?`
- `Regenerate the summary for this call.`

### get\_salesforce\_write\_policy tool

The **get\_salesforce\_write\_policy** tool returns the configured sales methodology and the Salesforce fields allowed for post-meeting writes. Your LLM uses this tool to confirm the configured methodology and fields before generating or writing a summary.

**Try asking**:

- `What sales methodology is this deployment using?`
- `Which Salesforce fields can this write to?`
- `Show me the write policy for this deployment.`

### write\_summary\_to\_system\_of\_record tool

The **write\_summary\_to\_system\_of\_record** tool writes a summary to Salesforce as Opportunity fields and a Task, with an optional linked Note. Your LLM uses this tool to commit a summary after showing you a preview and receiving your confirmation.

**Try asking**:

- `Update Salesforce based on my call with Acme.`
- `Change the next step to "Schedule an executive sponsor call" before you save it.`
- `Show me what will be written before you save it.`
- `Go ahead and save this summary to Salesforce.`

### retrieve\_kb\_resources tool

The **retrieve\_kb\_resources** tool retrieves supporting customer stories or product resources. Your LLM uses this tool to pull in supporting resources when you ask for a resourced follow-up. This doesn't retrieve a full call transcript.

**Try asking**:

- `Find relevant case studies for this call.`
- `Pull product resources related to this summary.`
- `What customer stories match the objections raised in this call?`

### search\_transcript\_chunks tool

The **search\_transcript\_chunks** tool retrieves chunked transcript documents for a call, or runs a semantic search across transcript chunks. Your LLM uses this tool to find a specific mention or topic within a call without regenerating the whole summary.

**Try asking**:

- `Search my call with Acme for any mention of budget.`
- `Find where the customer talked about renewal timing in this call.`
- `Pull the transcript chunks that mention our top competitor.`

### draft\_followup\_email\_gmail tool

The **draft\_followup\_email\_gmail** tool drafts a follow-up email to a prospect through Gmail, optionally with supporting resources. Your LLM uses this tool to draft an email and show you the draft for approval before calling the matching send tool.

**Try asking**:

- `Draft a follow-up email for my call with Acme.`
- `Draft a follow-up in Gmail including relevant case studies.`
- `Write a follow-up email to dana@example.com about this call.`
- `Redraft the follow-up email in a more formal tone.`

### draft\_followup\_email\_outlook tool

The **draft\_followup\_email\_outlook** tool drafts a follow-up email to a prospect through Outlook, optionally with supporting resources. Your LLM uses this tool to draft an email and show you the draft for approval before calling the matching send tool.

**Try asking**:

- `Draft a follow-up email for my call with Acme in Outlook.`
- `Write an Outlook follow-up including the case studies you found.`
- `Draft a follow-up to dana@example.com about this call.`
- `Redraft the Outlook follow-up in a more formal tone.`

### send\_followup\_email\_gmail tool

The **send\_followup\_email\_gmail** tool sends an approved follow-up email through Gmail. Your LLM uses this tool to send an email you approved. Sends are immediate. This tool doesn't support scheduling.

**Try asking**:

- `Send the follow-up email.`
- `Go ahead and send the Gmail draft.`
- `Send this email now that I've approved it.`

### send\_followup\_email\_outlook tool

The **send\_followup\_email\_outlook** tool sends an approved follow-up email through Outlook. Your LLM uses this tool to send an email you approved. Sends are immediate. This tool doesn't support scheduling.

**Try asking**:

- `Send the follow-up email.`
- `Go ahead and send the Outlook draft.`
- `Send this email now that I've approved it.`

### list\_pending\_meetings tool

The **list\_pending\_meetings** tool lists meetings being processed by this server. Your LLM uses this tool to surface what you still owe follow-up on, without requiring you to name a specific meeting.

**Try asking**:

- `What calls do I still owe follow-up on?`
- `Show me my pending meetings from the last two weeks.`
- `What have I not finished processing yet?`
