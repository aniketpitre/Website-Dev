# Linear Project Planning MCP server

The Linear Project Planning MCP server enables LLMs to interact with Linear for the planning and roadmap layer through natural conversation. It provides tools to browse and create projects, post health-tagged status updates, review initiatives and their child projects, inspect cycles and the active cycle's progress, and find and create planning documents without requiring direct interaction with the Linear interface.

> **SERVER SCOPE**
> 
> The Linear Project Planning MCP server manages the Linear planning layer, including projects, initiatives, cycles, and documents. It surfaces issues only inside [get\_active\_cycle](#get-active-cycle-tool), where they're read-only. Use the [Linear Issues](/en/mcp/prebuilt-mcps/linear-issues-mcp-server) MCP server to create, update, and manage issues.

## Uses

Use the Linear Project Planning MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Browse projects workspace-wide or scoped to a team, filtered by status or lead.
- Get a project's full details, including its teams, members, and related initiatives.
- Create a new project with one or more teams and optional lead and dates.
- Update a project's name, description, status, lead, or dates.
- Post a health-tagged status update (on track, at risk, or off track) to a project.
- Browse initiatives and the child projects under each one.
- List a team's cycles and review their progress.
- Check a team's active cycle, including issues grouped by workflow state.
- Find and create planning documents attached to a project.

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Linear Project Planning MCP server tools:

- `List all active projects for the Platform team.`
- `Show me the full details for the Checkout Redesign project.`
- `Create a new project called Q3 Onboarding Revamp for the Growth team.`
- `Update the Billing Migration project's status to Started.`
- `Post a status update on the Mobile App Relaunch project marking it at risk.`
- `What initiatives do we have, and which projects fall under each one?`
- `List the last five cycles for the Platform team.`
- `How is the current sprint going for the Growth team?`
- `Find the planning documents attached to the Checkout Redesign project.`
- `Create a planning doc called Launch Checklist attached to the Mobile App Relaunch project.`

## How to use Linear Project Planning MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools:

### list\_projects tool

The **list\_projects** tool returns projects across the workspace or scoped to one team, with optional status and lead filters. Your LLM uses this tool to find projects by team, status, or lead before retrieving one with [get\_project](#get-project-tool).

**Try asking**:

- `List all projects for the Platform team.`
- `Show me projects that are currently paused.`
- `Find projects led by Priya Patel.`

### get\_project tool

The **get\_project** tool looks up one project by name or ID. Your LLM uses this tool to retrieve a project's teams, members, and initiatives, before reporting on it or updating it. This tool only returns the first 50 project members found.

**Try asking**:

- `Show me the full details for the Checkout Redesign project.`
- `Who's on the Mobile App Relaunch project?`
- `What initiatives is the Billing Migration project part of?`

### create\_project tool

The **create\_project** tool starts a new project under one or more teams, with an optional lead and dates. Your LLM uses this tool when you ask to create a project and provide at least one name and team.

**Try asking**:

- `Create a new project called Q3 Onboarding Revamp for the Growth team.`
- `Set up a project for the mobile redesign, led by Jordan, starting next Monday.`
- `Start a new project on the Platform team with a target date of December 1st.`

> **DEFAULT PROJECT STATUS**
> 
> The new project uses the default status configured in Linear. Use [update\_project](#update-project-tool) afterward if you need to change it.

### update\_project tool

The **update\_project** tool changes a project's name, description, status, lead, or dates. Your LLM uses this tool to adjust one or more project fields when you ask to update them. This tool can't clear existing values.

**Try asking**:

- `Update the Billing Migration project's status to Started.`
- `Change the lead on the Checkout Redesign project to Sam.`
- `Push back the target date on the Mobile App Relaunch project to next quarter.`

### create\_project\_update tool

The **create\_project\_update** tool publishes a health-tagged status update on a project. Your LLM uses this tool to write a markdown narrative tagged `On track`, `At risk`, or `Off track` after you supply the project and the update text.

**Try asking**:

- `Post a status update on the Mobile App Relaunch project marking it at risk.`
- `Add an on-track update to the Checkout Redesign project summarizing this week's progress.`
- `Mark the Billing Migration project off track and explain why.`

### list\_initiatives tool

The **list\_initiatives** tool retrieves initiatives and up to 25 of their child projects. Your LLM uses this tool to review a roadmap.

**Try asking**:

- `What initiatives do we have, and which projects fall under each one?`
- `Show me the status and health of all our initiatives.`
- `List the projects under the Platform Modernization initiative.`

### list\_cycles tool

The **list\_cycles** tool returns a team's cycles. The newest cycles return first. Your LLM uses this tool to review a team's recent or upcoming sprints before inspecting one in detail.

**Try asking**:

- `List the last five cycles for the Platform team.`
- `Show me the Growth team's cycles.`
- `What cycles has the Mobile team run this quarter?`

### get\_active\_cycle tool

The **get\_active\_cycle** tool retrieves a team's current cycle, including its progress and its issues grouped by workflow state. Your LLM uses this tool for a sprint check-in, showing cycle progress alongside up to 200 of the most recently updated issues. Issues are read-only in this view.

**Try asking**:

- `How is the current sprint going for the Growth team?`
- `Show me the active cycle's progress for the Platform team.`
- `What issues are still in progress in this sprint?`

### list\_documents tool

The **list\_documents** tool retrieves planning documents, optionally filtered by project or initiative. Initiative names don't resolve automatically, so filtering by initiative requires an ID. Your LLM uses this tool to find existing planning docs before creating a new one or reporting what documentation already exists for a project.

**Try asking**:

- `Find the planning documents attached to the Checkout Redesign project.`
- `What documents exist for the Mobile App Relaunch project?`
- `List all planning documents in the workspace.`

### create\_document tool

The **create\_document** tool adds a new planning document to a project. Your LLM uses this tool to capture a markdown document after you supply a title, content, and the project to attach it to.

**Try asking**:

- `Create a planning doc called Launch Checklist attached to the Mobile App Relaunch project.`
- `Write up a new document with our Q3 goals for the Growth team's project.`
- `Add a kickoff doc to the Checkout Redesign project.`

### list\_teams tool

The **list\_teams** tool returns the teams available for scoping projects and cycles. Your LLM uses this tool to find a team's identifier or key before using it to filter [list\_projects](#list-projects-tool), [list\_cycles](#list-cycles-tool), or [get\_active\_cycle](#get-active-cycle-tool).

**Try asking**:

- `What teams exist in our workspace?`
- `Find the team key for the Platform team.`
- `List all teams with cycles enabled.`
