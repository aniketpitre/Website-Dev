> Use the Employee Offboarding MCP server to connect your LLM to Workday, Okta, Google Workspace, Slack, Zoom, and ServiceNow to preview a departing employee's full access revocation plan, execute it after explicit confirmation, and track every system from a single approved Workday termination event.

# Employee Offboarding MCP server

The Employee Offboarding MCP server enables LLMs to interact with Workday, Okta, Google Workspace, Slack, Zoom, ServiceNow, Salesforce, and GitHub for cross-system access revocation when an employee leaves your organization, through natural conversation. It provides tools to resolve the departing employee, preview the full revocation plan, execute the plan after explicit confirmation, track per-system progress, retry failed steps, and cancel work that's still in progress.

## Uses

Use the Employee Offboarding MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Resolve a departing employee by name, work email, or Worker ID and review their pending Workday termination events
- Preview the full cross-system revocation plan bound to an approved Workday termination event, without committing changes
- Revoke Okta sessions and OAuth tokens, then suspend the Okta account
- Suspend the employee's Google Workspace account through the Directory
- Deactivate the employee's Slack and Zoom accounts, and Salesforce and GitHub when your deployment enables them
- Create ServiceNow tickets for the work outside automated scope, including device return, mail-forwarding follow-up, and personal access token audits
- Notify the departing employee's manager
- Schedule revocation for a future access cutoff during a notice period, or revoke immediately for an involuntary termination
- Track per-system progress, retry failed non-critical steps, and cancel scheduled or in-progress offboardings

Additionally, use the server's built-in [Employee Offboarding MCP apps](#employee-offboarding-process-mcp-apps) to review a plan before you confirm it and to track execution afterward.

## Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Employee Offboarding MCP server tools:

- `Offboard Dan Chen. The approved Workday termination event is TERM-4821.`
- `Look up Ariel Miller's pending termination events.`
- `Offboard this employee immediately. The termination is effective today.`
- `Show me the revocation plan before anything gets cut.`
- `What's the status of offboarding off_a1b2c3?`
- `Which systems failed on Jade's offboarding?`
- `Retry the Zoom deactivation step.`
- `Cancel the scheduled offboarding for Worker 100294.`
- `Show me every offboarding in flight.`
- `List the offboardings I started in the last two weeks.`

## Employee Offboarding MCP server tools

The Employee Offboarding MCP server provides the following tools:

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [find\_employee](#find-employee-tool) | Resolves an employee from a name, email, or Worker ID and returns their identity, manager, and pending Workday termination events. |
| [execute\_offboarding](#execute-offboarding-tool) | Returns a revocation plan for your approval, then executes that specific plan when you confirm it. |
| [get\_offboarding\_status](#get-offboarding-status-tool) | Returns per-system status for an offboarding, including criticality and retry availability. |
| [retry\_offboarding\_step](#retry-offboarding-step-tool) | Retries a single failed step after a preview, without re-running earlier or later steps. |
| [cancel\_offboarding](#cancel-offboarding-tool) | Cancels an offboarding according to its current state, without reactivating any suspended account. |
| [list\_offboardings](#list-offboardings-tool) | Lists offboardings by status, initiator, employee, or date range. |

> **EVERY COMMIT NEEDS ITS OWN APPROVAL**
> 
> `execute_offboarding`, `retry_offboarding_step`, and `cancel_offboarding` each run in two stages. Your LLM calls the tool to return a preview, then calls it again only after you explicitly approve that preview.
> 
> Approval doesn't carry over. The server binds your confirmation to the specific preview that immediately precedes it, and rejects a plan that's expired or has an underlying state that's moved.

## Install the Employee Offboarding MCP server

Complete the following steps to install a prebuilt MCP server to your project:

1. Sign in to your Workato account.
   
2. Go to **AI Hub > Enterprise MCP > Custom servers**.

   > **VERIFIED USER ACCESS AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENTS**
   > 
   > Only app connections that use OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant are available for user's connection. Refer to [Verified user access](/en/mcp/verified-user-access) for more information.
   
10. Complete the app-specific connection setup steps in the following section.
    

## Employee Offboarding connection setup

Configure the following connections to set up the Employee Offboarding MCP server:

- [Workday](#workday-connection): Required. Supplies the approved termination event.
- [Okta](#okta-connection): Required. Revokes sessions and OAuth tokens, then suspends the account.
- [Google Workspace](#google-workspace-connection): Required. Suspends the employee's Directory user.
- [Slack](#slack-connection): Required. Resets sessions and deactivates the user.
- [Zoom](#zoom-connection): Required. Deactivates the user.
- [ServiceNow](#servicenow-connection): Required. Creates the device-return, mail-forwarding, and token-audit tickets, and records the manager notification.
- [Salesforce](#salesforce-connection): Required.
- [GitHub](#github-connection): Required.

> **OKTA SSO IS A DEPLOYMENT PREREQUISITE**
> 
> Enforce Okta SSO on every SaaS application you plan to use before you deploy this MCP server. The MCP server doesn't check for SSO enforcement at runtime.

### Employee Offboarding role requirements

Each tool's availability depends on the permissions of the connected account. Calling a tool without the required permission returns a `permission_denied` outcome rather than a partial result.

The MCP server separates the two identities on every audit record. The authenticated caller is recorded as `initiating_actor` and must hold the HR offboarding permission. The per-deployment service credential that performs each downstream administrative operation is recorded as `execution_identity`. HR business partners don't hold the service credentials.

- **Workday**: Requires an integration user with permission to read the termination event.
  
- **Okta**: Requires an admin API token with session management, token management, and user lifecycle management scopes.
  
- **Google Workspace**: Requires a service account with domain-wide delegation and the `admin.directory.user` scope, granted to an account holding the User Management admin role. Gmail API access isn't required, because the server only suspends the Directory user.
  
- **Slack**: Requires a Business+ or Enterprise plan for SCIM deactivation. The individual session-reset method requires Enterprise.
  
- **Zoom**: Requires a Business plan or above.
  
- **ServiceNow**: Requires write scope on the incident and request tables you configure.
  
- **Salesforce**: Requires Enterprise Edition or above and the Manage Users permission.
  
- **GitHub**: Requires GitHub Enterprise Cloud, with either SCIM provisioning through Enterprise Managed Users (EMU) or SAML SSO on member accounts.
  

#### Workday connection setup steps

View Workday REST connection setup steps

The Workato Workday connector is categorized into three distinct types: the main Workday connector, the Workday Web Services connector, and the Workday REST connector. Each type follows a similar authentication pattern but differs slightly in support capabilities and functionalities.

Workday doesn't support outbound webhooks, so the Workato Workday connector consumes termination events by polling, on a five to fifteen minute interval by default. This sets a threshold on how quickly a newly approved event becomes visible to `find_employee`. It doesn't affect the offboarding itself, which you initiate once you have the event ID.

The Workday REST API requires authentication through an OAuth client setup.

> **API CLIENTS FOR INTEGRATION NOT SUPPORTED**
> 
> Register a standard Workday API client to complete this connection. Workday API clients for Integration aren't supported in the Employee Offboarding MCP server.

##### Register a new API client in Workday

10. Click **Connect**.
    

#### Okta connection setup steps

View Okta connection setup steps

This deployment uses Okta's API key authentication method (an Okta API token). The token inherits the permissions of the administrator who generates it, since Okta API tokens don't support granular OAuth scopes the way Okta's authorization code grant and client credentials methods do.

#### Generate an API key

  

> **API KEY PRIVILEGES AND LIMITATIONS**
> 
> You must have administrator privileges in Okta to create an API key. Ensure that you're logged in as an administrator before you proceed.
> 
> Workato requires that the user and API key used in the connection have **Organization Administrator** or **Super Administrator** permissions. API keys inherit all permissions from the administrator who created them and can't be restricted to specific resources or operations.
> 
> Refer to [Create an API token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/create-the-token/) for more information.

Complete the following steps to generate an API key in Okta:

1. Sign in to Okta.
   
2. Go to **Security > API > Token**.
   
3. Click **Create token** to generate an API key. The key inherits the permissions of the administrator who created it.
   

#### Connect to Okta using API key-based authentication

Complete the following steps to create an API key connection to Okta in Workato:

1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for and select **Okta** as your connection on the **New connection** page.
   
3. Provide a unique name for the connection in the **Connection name** field.
   
   ![Okta API key connection setup](/assets/connection-setup-api.VbvzwXfa.png)_Okta API key connection setup_
   
4. Use the **Authentication type** drop-down menu to select **API key**.
   
5. Enter your Okta domain name in the **Okta domain** field. For example, `mycompany.okta.com` or `mytest.oktapreview.com`. Ensure that the domain name you enter doesn't include `-admin`, such as `mycompany-admin.okta.com`, as this URL is used to access the Okta admin console from the UI and isn't an OAuth endpoint.
   
6. Enter the API key generated in your Okta instance.
   
7. Click **Connect**.
   

#### Google Workspace connection setup steps

View Google Workspace connection setup steps

This deployment requires service account authentication. The Google Workspace connector's OAuth 2.0 authentication method ties the connection to one employee's own Google identity, which can't suspend another employee's account.

You must enable the Google Workspace API to complete the connection setup.

> **REQUIRED SCOPE FOR SERVICE ACCOUNT AUTHENTICATION**
> 
> Ensure that you have the `admin.directory.user` scope to successfully suspend Directory users.
> 
> The service account impersonates the user based on the email address you provide during the connection setup after authentication is complete.

You must enable the Google Workspace API to complete the connection setup.

> **REQUIRED SCOPES FOR SERVICE ACCOUNT AUTHENTICATION**
> 
> Ensure that you have the following required permissions to successfully connect to Google Workspace using a service account:
> 
> - `admin.directory.user`
> - `admin.directory.orgunit`
> - `admin.directory.domain`
> - `admin.directory.group`
> - `admin.directory.group.member`
> - `admin.datatransfer`
> - `admin.directory.device.mobile.action`
> - `admin.directory.userschema`
> - `admin.reports.audit.readonly`
> - `admin.reports.usage.readonly`
> - `admin.directory.rolemanagement`
> - `admin.directory.user.security`
> 
> The service account impersonates the user based on the email address you provide during the connection setup after authentication is complete.

##### Salesforce OAuth 2.0 authentication

View OAuth 2.0 authentication steps

#### Connect to Salesforce using OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Grant)

Complete the following steps to set up an OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Grant) connection to Salesforce in Workato:

> **OAUTH RESTRICTIONS**
> 
> As of early September 2025, Salesforce restricts the use of uninstalled Salesforce Connected Apps. Refer to [OAuth restrictions](/en/connectors/salesforce#oauth-restrictions) for required actions if you encounter errors when you create a new connection. These steps are required for all new Salesforce connections starting **September 17, 2025**.

1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `Salesforce` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name in the **Connection name** field.
   
   ![Salesforce connection setup](/assets/connect.CnntY3nd.png)_OAuth2.0 Salesforce connection setup_
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Use the **Auth type** drop-down menu to select **OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Grant)**.
   
6. Use the **Sandbox** drop-down menu to specify whether the Salesforce account is a sandbox account.
   
7. Optional. Expand **Advanced settings** to configure the following options:
   
   Advanced settings
   
   - **Organization/community custom domain URL**: Enter the URL to your Salesforce community's custom domain. Required for community connections with unique domains.
   - **Requested permissions**: Select [permissions](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_oauth_scopes.htm&type=5) to request for this connection. Refer to [Requested scopes](/en/connectors/salesforce#oauth2-scopes) for the scopes Workato requests.
   - **Verified user access configuration**: Configure custom auth for personal connections. Refer to [Runtime user connections](/en/features/runtime-user-connections) for more information.
   
   > **REFRESH TOKEN SCOPE IS REQUIRED**
   > 
   > The **Perform requests at any time (`refresh_token`, `offline_access`)** scope is one of the scopes Workato requests for OAuth 2.0 connections, but whether Salesforce actually grants this scope depends on the Connected App's own OAuth policies, not on the Workato connection's settings. Refer to [Salesforce connection disconnects repeatedly](/en/connectors/salesforce/troubleshoot-connection-setup#salesforce-connection-disconnects-repeatedly) if your connection later disconnects when the access token expires. A Refresh Token Policy or IP Relaxation setting can cause the same symptom.
   
8. Optional. Use the **Custom OAuth profile** drop-down menu to select a custom OAuth profile for your connection. Refer to [Create a custom OAuth profile for Salesforce](/en/connectors/salesforce/custom-oauth) for more information.
   
9. Click **Connect**.
   
10. Optional. If your Salesforce organization or community uses a custom domain, complete the following in the sign-in modal:
    
    - Click **Use Custom Domain**.
    - Enter your **Custom domain**, then click **Continue**.
    
    ![Salesforce custom domains](/assets/connection-custom-domain.D3hJN8X8.png)_Enter your Custom domain._
    
11. Enter your Salesforce **Username** and **Password**.
    
    ![Salesforce connection setup](/assets/login.CIu5oc0P.png)_Log in to your Salesforce account_
    
12. Click **Log In** to complete the setup.
    
    > **OAUTH\_APPROVAL\_ERROR\_GENERIC**
    > 
    > If you see this error, Salesforce is restricting the Workato app because it isn't installed. A Salesforce admin must install the app in **Connected Apps OAuth Usage** or assign the Salesforce permissions. Refer to [OAuth restrictions](/en/connectors/salesforce#oauth-restrictions) for details.
    

##### Salesforce JWT bearer authentication

View JWT bearer authentication steps

> **ACTIONS ON BEHALF OF USER**
> 
> JWT connections can perform actions on behalf of a user you specify using the **On-behalf-of-user email** field. Contact your Workato Customer Success Manager to enable this feature.

#### How it works

JWT bearer authentication connects using a digital certificate that signs a JWT request. Workato sends a JWT to the Salesforce OAuth token endpoint, where Salesforce processes the JWT and issues an access token based on prior approval of Workato in Salesforce.

Although JWT bearer skips interactive sign-in, Salesforce still evaluates every request against the permissions of the user specified in the connection and attributes any changes to that user. Use a dedicated integration user rather than a personal account.

Refer to [Required roles and permissions](/en/connectors/salesforce#roles-and-permissions-required-to-connect) for the Salesforce permissions the connected user needs.

#### Generate a private key and certificate

JWT bearer authentication requires a private key and a certificate. The following command generates both using OpenSSL. Replace the `-subj` values with your own:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout server.key \
  -out server.crt \
  -days 365 \
  -subj "/CN=Your App Name/O=Your Organization/C=US"
```

This generates two files:

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `server.key` | Your private key for Workato. Keep this secret. |
| `server.crt` | Your public certificate for Salesforce. |

Refer to Salesforce's documentation for more information:

- [OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Flow for Server-to-Server Integration](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.remoteaccess_oauth_jwt_flow.htm&language=en_US&type=5): Details on how Salesforce uses this certificate to sign and validate JWTs.
- [Create a Private Key and Self-Signed Digital Certificate](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_key_and_cert.htm): Other ways to generate a private key and certificate.

#### Create an external client app for JWT bearer

JWT bearer authentication also requires a registered external client app in Salesforce. Complete the following steps before creating your connection in Workato. Refer to Salesforce's [Create an External Client App](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.create_a_local_external_client_app.htm&language=en_US&type=5) documentation for more information.

#### GitHub connection setup steps

View GitHub connection setup steps

GitHub offboarding differs across account models. Declare which model applies to your organization during deployment, so the server removes membership through the correct path and records the model in the audit record.

| GitHub account model | How the server deprovisions |
| --- | --- |
| Enterprise Managed Users (EMU) | SCIM deprovision, which also revokes personal access tokens |
| Organization or enterprise membership with SAML SSO | Membership removal and SAML credential authorization revocation |

#### Data table configuration

Edit the following keys in the `offboarding_config` data table to control which applications this deployment deprovisions, how it escalates and routes failures, and where it sends notifications:

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled_list` | Choose which optional applications this deployment deprovisions. Select `salesforce`, `github`, or both. The server skips an application that isn't on this list and doesn't create a follow-up ticket for it, even if that application is assigned to the employee in Okta. This doesn't apply to Slack or Zoom, which the server deprovisions. |
| `notifications_channel` | Choose the channel the server uses to send the manager notification. |
| `github_account_model` | Declare which GitHub account model applies to your organization. This ensures that the server deprovisions through the correct path. Required when `enabled_list` includes `github`. |
| `github_enterprise` / `github_org` | Enter your GitHub Enterprise and organization slugs. Required when `github_account_model` needs them to resolve the account. |
| `escalation_target` | Enter the identity the [Status App](#status-app) surfaces when a critical step fails. |
| `okta_app_id_slack` / `okta_app_id_zoom` / `okta_app_id_salesforce` / `okta_app_id_github` | Enter each application's Okta app ID. The server adds a deactivation step only when this app is assigned to the departing employee in Okta. Salesforce and GitHub are only deprovisioned if they're also in the `enabled_list`. |
| `snow_assignment_it` / `snow_assignment_google_admin` / `snow_assignment_app_admin` | Enter the ServiceNow assignment group for the device-return, mail-forwarding, and token-audit tickets. |

## How to use Employee Offboarding MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools.

### find\_employee tool

The **find\_employee** tool resolves an employee from a name, work email, or Worker ID and returns their identity, manager, and pending Workday termination events. Your LLM uses this tool when you name an employee to offboard, or when you ask about someone's termination events.

**Try asking**:

- `Look up Ariel Miller.`
- `Find the employee with Worker ID 100294.`
- `Does Dan Chen have an approved termination event?`
- `Show me dan.chen@example.com, including terminated employees.`

### execute\_offboarding tool

The **execute\_offboarding** tool returns a revocation plan when you call it in preview, and executes that plan when you confirm it. Your LLM uses this tool when you ask to offboard an employee.

**Try asking**:

- `Offboard Dan Chen. The approved Workday termination event is TERM-4821.`
- `Offboard this employee immediately, effective now.`
- `Show me the plan for Worker 100294's offboarding before anything is cut.`
- `Resume the offboarding that needs attention for Ariel Okafor.`

### get\_offboarding\_status tool

The **get\_offboarding\_status** tool returns per-system status for an offboarding. Your LLM uses this tool when you ask how an offboarding is progressing, and immediately after you confirm a plan to report initial progress.

**Try asking**:

- `What's the status of offboarding off_a1b2c3?`
- `How far along is Dan Chen's offboarding?`
- `Which systems failed on Jade's offboarding?`
- `Show me the audit records for this offboarding.`

### retry\_offboarding\_step tool

The **retry\_offboarding\_step** tool retries a single failed step. Your LLM uses this tool when you ask to retry a step that failed, and it previews the retry before running it.

**Try asking**:

- `Retry the Zoom deactivation step.`
- `The Slack step failed. Can you try it again?`
- `Show me what retrying step 4 would do.`
- `Retry the failed ServiceNow ticket for this offboarding.`

### cancel\_offboarding tool

The **cancel\_offboarding** tool cancels an offboarding according to its current state. Your LLM uses this tool when you ask to cancel, and it previews the cancellation first so you can see what can and can't be undone.

**Try asking**:

- `Cancel the scheduled offboarding for Worker 100294.`
- `Stop the offboarding for Dan Chen.`
- `What would canceling off_a1b2c3 actually undo?`
- `Cancel the remaining steps. The termination was rescinded.`

### list\_offboardings tool

The **list\_offboardings** tool lists offboardings by status, initiator, employee, or date range. Your LLM uses this tool when you ask what's in progress, when you ask about recent offboardings, or when it needs to find an offboarding ID.

**Try asking**:

- `Show me every offboarding in progress.`
- `List the offboardings I started in the last two weeks.`
- `Which offboardings completed with failures this month?`
- `Find the offboarding for Worker 100294.`

## Employee Offboarding MCP apps

The Employee Offboarding MCP server includes two [MCP apps](/en/mcp/mcp-apps) that open at the two points where a structured view reduces error. Neither app adds a confirmation step or skips a preview. Refer to [MCP Apps](/en/mcp/mcp-apps) for more information.

### Plan Review App

The Plan Review App opens after `execute_offboarding` returns a preview. It shows the employee's identity alongside the Workday event that grounds the offboarding, including the event ID, type, approval timestamp, approver, termination reason category, and position time zone, so you can catch a plan built on the wrong event.

The app groups the planned actions by criticality, such as access revocation, SaaS deactivations, ServiceNow tickets, and manager notification. Each application appears with the exact action the server takes. The tickets the MCP server creates for out-of-scope work appear explicitly.

A countdown shows how long the plan remains valid. Confirming in the app calls `execute_offboarding` with your confirmation and the plan's ID.

### Status App

The Status App opens after you confirm a plan. It shows each system as a row in a timeline, with the action, a criticality badge, a status pill, and a timestamp. Rows update as the app polls `get_offboarding_status`, and each completed step shows an audit record ID, with links to the ServiceNow tickets the server created.

A critical step failure raises a banner naming your configured escalation target and pauses the steps that depend on it. A failed non-critical row offers a retry that opens an inline preview panel first, and canceling the remaining steps opens a cancellation preview panel the same way.
