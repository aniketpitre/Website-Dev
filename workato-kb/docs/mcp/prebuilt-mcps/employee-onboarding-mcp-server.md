> Use the Employee Onboarding MCP server to connect your LLM to Workday, Slack, and Google Calendar to kick off onboarding, track checklists, and escalate issues.

# Employee Onboarding MCP server

The Employee Onboarding MCP server enables LLMs to interact with Workday, Slack, and Google Calendar for employee onboarding through natural conversation. It provides tools to resolve the hire, preview and commit the initial kickoff, and manage self-service onboarding for both the new hire and the manager. This server works alongside the [Access Provisioning](/en/mcp/prebuilt-mcps/access-provisioning-mcp-server), [ServiceNow ITSM](/en/mcp/prebuilt-mcps/servicenow-itsm-mcp-server), or [Confluence](/en/mcp/prebuilt-mcps/confluence-mcp-server) MCP servers if they're installed. For example, if a Confluence server is installed, it answers onboarding and policy questions, and **escalate\_or\_create\_ticket** handles issues only.

## Uses

Use the Employee Onboarding MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Resolve a new hire by name, work email, or Worker ID and confirm their approved Workday hire event, including their region and employment context
- Preview then commit the kickoff, including the initial meeting, the hire's welcome email, and a manager pre-arrival notification
- Check onboarding status for a specific hire
- Get checklist items due for either the new hire's onboarding checklist or the manager's own pre-boarding checklist
- Mark a checklist item complete or reopen it
- Schedule additional onboarding meetings after the kickoff
- Notify HR about a new hire's issue or question over Slack, or ask general policy questions when a [Confluence](/en/mcp/prebuilt-mcps/confluence-mcp-server) server isn't available as a knowledge source
- List onboardings in progress or upcoming, or cancel an onboarding

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Employee Onboarding MCP server tools:

- `Kick off onboarding for Jordan Lee, starting the 22nd.`
- `Does Jordan Lee have an approved hire event yet?`
- `Show me the kickoff plan before anything gets scheduled.`
- `What's my onboarding status?`
- `What do I need to do this week?`
- `Mark the benefits enrollment item as done.`
- `What's on my pre-boarding checklist for Jordan Lee?`
- `My laptop hasn't shown up yet.`
- `Show me everyone starting this month.`

## Employee Onboarding connection setup

View Employee Onboarding connection setup steps

Configure the following connections to set up the Employee Onboarding MCP server:

- [Workday](#workday-connection): Required. Provides information about approved hires.
- [Slack](#slack-connection): Required. Sends the manager pre-arrival notification as a direct message, posts escalations to the Slack user or channel configured in `escalation.hrbp_notification_target`, and serves as the Q&A fallback when [Confluence](/en/mcp/prebuilt-mcps/confluence-mcp-server) isn't available.
- [Google Calendar](#google-calendar-connection): Required. Schedules meetings.

### Employee Onboarding role requirements

Each tool's availability depends on the permissions of the connected account. Calling a tool without the required permission returns a `permission_denied` outcome rather than a partial result.

- **Workday**: The connected API client must be able to read hire events.
- **Slack**: The connected account's OAuth scopes must include `chat:write` to post the manager pre-arrival notification, Q&A fallback answers, and escalations.
- **Google Calendar**: The connected account must have permission to create events and invite attendees.

Additionally, **initiate\_onboarding** and **cancel\_onboarding** are only available to users in the server's `hr_persons` allowlist. **list\_onboardings** gives `hr_persons` members a complete view of every onboarding, scopes any other caller to onboardings where they're recorded as the hire's manager, and denies a hire's own request outright.

#### Workday connection setup steps

View Workday REST connection setup steps

The Workato Workday connector is categorized into three distinct types: the main Workday connector, the Workday Web Services connector, and the Workday REST connector. Each type follows a similar authentication pattern but differs slightly in support capabilities and functionalities.

The Workday REST API requires authentication through an OAuth client setup.

#### Google Calendar connection setup steps

View Google Calendar connection setup steps

##### API version

The Google Calendar connector uses the [Google Calendar API v3](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/v3/reference).

Workato supports the following types of connections to Google Calendar:

- [OAuth 2.0 authentication](#oauth)
- [Service account authentication](#service-account-authentication)
  - [Minimum scopes for service account connections](#minimum-scopes-for-service-account-connections)
  - [Set up a Google service account](#set-up-a-google-service-account)
  - [Enable the Google Calendar API](#api-setup)
  - [Complete setup in Workato](#setup)

You can use a service account to authenticate without a personal user account. Workato recommends service account authentication for consistent use.

##### OAuth 2.0 authentication

Complete the following steps to set up your Google Calendar connection using OAuth 2.0:

1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for and select `Google Calendar` as your connection on the **New connection** page.
   
3. Provide a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
   
4. Select the project where you plan to store the connection from the **Location** drop-down menu.
   
5. Select **OAuth 2.0** as the **Authentication type**.
   
6. Click **Sign in with Google**, then sign in to your Google account. Ensure your Google account has sufficient permissions to manage the events and calendars you plan to use in Workato. ![Click Sign in with Google](/assets/google-calendar-sign-in-with-google.DQ57V-DM.png)_Click **Sign in with Google**._
   

##### Service account authentication

A Google service account is a specialized Google account associated with a Google Cloud Project (GCP) that can run API requests on your behalf.

Service accounts provide the following benefits:

- **Continuous operation:** Service accounts ensure that operations continue even if individual user permissions change.
- **Dedicated permissions:** Service accounts can only access projects that you share with them.
- **Dedicated API quotas:** You can manage a service account's API quotas through GCP and request quota increases directly from Google.

Refer to the [Google service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) to learn more about service accounts.

Service account authentication consists of the following actions:

- [Set up a Google service account](#set-up-a-google-service-account)
- [Enable the Google Calendar API](#api-setup)
- [Complete setup in Workato](#setup)

###### Minimum scopes for service account connections

The following scopes are required to connect to Google Calendar using a service account:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.resource.calendar`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`

A `401 Unauthorized error` may occur when the service account uses the `Owner` role or lacks required scopes. Assign the `Editor` role to the service account in the Google Cloud Console and confirm it includes all required scopes listed above. This ensures the service account can authenticate and access Google Calendar successfully.

Refer to the [Google Calendar API scopes](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/auth) documentation for a complete list of supported scopes.

###### Set up a Google service account

Complete the following steps to set up a Google service account:

1. [Create a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating) in your GCP project.
   
2. Go to **IAM & Admin > Service accounts**. Ensure your dashboard is scoped to the project that contains your service account. ![Check the scope of your dashboard.](/assets/service-project-scope.8Rf50DK2.png)_Check the scope of your dashboard._
   
3. Click the **Email** of the service account you intend to use. ![Click the email of the service account you intend to use.](/assets/service-email-button.C9qaZFkJ.png)_Click the **Email** of the service account you intend to use._
   
4. Copy the service account's **Email** and save it to configure your connection later. ![Copy the account's email](/assets/service-account-email.DM6BBBhN.png)_Copy the account's **Email**._
   
5. Go to the **KEYS** tab.
   
6. [Generate a private key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating_service_account_keys) and download it in JSON format. You can only download the key once.
   
7. Open the JSON file, then copy the entire private key from `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` to `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n` (inclusive) and save it to configure your connection later.
   

###### Enable the Google Calendar API

You must enable the Google Calendar API before you return to Workato to finish setting up your connection.

1. Sign in to Google's [API library](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library).
   
2. Search for and select the `Google Calendar API`.
   
3. Click **Enable** to enable the API. ![Enable the Google Calendar API](/assets/google-calendar-api.DMWBkrRb.png)_**Enable** the `Google Calendar API`_
   

###### Complete setup in Workato

Complete the following steps in Workato to set up your Google Calendar connection using a service account:

1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for and select `Google Calendar` as your connection on the **New connection** page.
   
3. Provide a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Select **Service account** as the **Authentication type**.
   
6. Enter your service account's **Private key**.
   
7. Provide the **User email** of the account you plan to impersonate.
   
   User impersonation lets the service account act on behalf of a designated user, accessing and managing events in their Google Calendar. Impersonating a user ensures data accuracy and enforces the permissions and access controls set for that user in Google Calendar. Refer to Google's [Service account impersonation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-impersonation) guide for more information.
   
8. Click **Sign in with Google** to complete the setup. ![Configure Google Calendar service account connection](/assets/service-account-connection.CG2N5lxI.png)_Configure Google Calendar service account connection_

## How to use Employee Onboarding MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools.

### find\_new\_hire tool

The **find\_new\_hire** tool finds a new hire in Workday and returns their identity, hiring manager, region and employment context, and the approved Workday hire event. This tool doesn't perform directory searches for other purposes. Your LLM uses this tool to resolve a hire you name, or to identify a new hire who gives their own name or email at the start of a self-service session.

**Try asking**:

- `Look up Jordan Lee.`
- `Find the new hire with Worker ID 100483.`
- `Does Jordan Lee have an approved hire event?`
- `Show me jordan.lee@example.com, including completed onboardings.`

### initiate\_onboarding tool

The **initiate\_onboarding** tool returns a kickoff plan for your approval, then schedules an initial meeting, sends the hire's welcome email, and notifies the manager. Your LLM uses this tool to kick off, start, or set up onboarding for a hire with an approved Workday hire event.

**Try asking**:

- `Kick off onboarding for Jordan Lee, starting the 22nd.`
- `Show me the kickoff plan before anything gets scheduled.`
- `Set up Jordan Lee's initial meeting for 9am.`

### get\_onboarding\_status tool

The **get\_onboarding\_status** tool returns the status of a hire's onboarding. It has no visibility into other MCP servers such as [Access Provisioning](/en/mcp/prebuilt-mcps/access-provisioning-mcp-server) or [ServiceNow ITSM](/en/mcp/prebuilt-mcps/servicenow-itsm-mcp-server). A new hire can only check their own status, and a manager can only check the status of their own hires. Users in `hr_persons` can query any hire's record. Your LLM uses this tool to check how onboarding is progressing, or to report initial progress right after you confirm a kickoff plan.

**Try asking**:

- `What's my onboarding status?`
- `How is Jordan Lee's onboarding going?`
- `Which step failed on this onboarding?`
- `What's the next item on my checklist?`

### get\_onboarding\_checklist tool

The **get\_onboarding\_checklist** tool returns checklist items due in either the new hire's onboarding checklist or the manager's own pre-boarding checklist. Your LLM uses this tool to show what's on a hire's or manager's checklist, what's due this week, or what to do next.

**Try asking**:

- `What do I need to do this week?`
- `What's on my pre-boarding checklist for Jordan Lee?`
- `Show me everything that's due so far.`
- `Has the benefits enrollment item come up yet?`

### update\_checklist\_item\_status tool

The **update\_checklist\_item\_status** tool marks a checklist item complete or reopens it. Your LLM uses this tool to mark a checklist item you've finished, or to reopen one you marked done by mistake.

**Try asking**:

- `Mark the benefits enrollment item as done.`
- `I finished setting up my workstation. Check that off.`
- `Reopen the IT equipment item, it's not actually done.`
- `Mark the pre-boarding desk setup item complete for Jordan Lee.`

### schedule\_onboarding\_meeting tool

The **schedule\_onboarding\_meeting** tool schedules an onboarding meeting. Your LLM uses this tool to set up time with someone during onboarding.

**Try asking**:

- `Schedule 30 minutes with IT to go over my laptop setup.`
- `Book a benefits walkthrough for next Tuesday afternoon.`
- `Show me the proposed time before you send the invite.`

### escalate\_or\_create\_ticket tool

The **escalate\_or\_create\_ticket** tool notifies HR about a new hire's issue or question over Slack. Your LLM uses this tool to escalate a problem you report or explicitly ask to escalate, and falls back on it for general onboarding or policy questions when a [Confluence MCP](/en/mcp/prebuilt-mcps/confluence-mcp-server) isn't available.

**Try asking**:

- `My laptop hasn't shown up yet.`
- `I can't log into my new account.`
- `Can you escalate this to HR?`
- `What's our policy on remote work during onboarding?`

### list\_onboardings tool

The **list\_onboardings** tool lists onboardings by status, hire, manager, or date range. Users in `hr_persons` see every onboarding matching the filters. Other callers only see onboardings where they're recorded as the hire's manager. The server directs new hires asking about onboardings to **get\_onboarding\_status** instead. Your LLM uses this tool to list onboardings in progress or coming up, or to find a specific onboarding.

**Try asking**:

- `Show me everyone starting this month.`
- `List onboardings in progress.`
- `Which onboardings are flagged for attention?`
- `Find the onboarding for Jordan Lee.`

### cancel\_onboarding tool

The **cancel\_onboarding** tool cancels a scheduled or in-progress onboarding. This performs an operational undo rather than a rehire or rescission action. It doesn't reverse anything done through the [Access Provisioning](/en/mcp/prebuilt-mcps/access-provisioning-mcp-server) or [ServiceNow ITSM](/en/mcp/prebuilt-mcps/servicenow-itsm-mcp-server) servers. Your LLM uses this tool to cancel an onboarding when an offer is rescinded, a start date changes materially, or you ask to cancel one already in flight.

**Try asking**:

- `Cancel Jordan Lee's onboarding. The offer was rescinded.`
- `Stop the onboarding for Worker 100483.`
- `What would canceling this onboarding actually undo?`
- `Cancel the remaining steps. The start date moved.`
