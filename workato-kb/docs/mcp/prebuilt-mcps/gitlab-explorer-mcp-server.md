> Use the GitLab Explorer MCP server to connect your LLM to GitLab with tools to retrieve and manage projects, issues, merge requests, commits, and pipelines through natural language.

# GitLab Explorer MCP server

The GitLab Explorer MCP server enables LLMs to interact with GitLab projects through natural conversation. It provides tools to retrieve and manage issues, merge requests (MRs), access repository context, and check pipeline status without requiring direct interaction with the GitLab interface.

## Uses

Use the GitLab Explorer MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Retrieve metadata and overview information for a GitLab project
- List and retrieve issues with filtering and sorting
- Create new issues and update existing issue metadata
- List and retrieve merge requests
- Create new merge requests and update existing merge request metadata
- Add comments to issues or merge requests
- Retrieve commit history for a project
- Search across GitLab projects for issues, merge requests, code, or projects
- Retrieve user context and associated projects
- Retrieve group or subgroup context, including metadata and structure
- Check pipeline status at the job level for a merge request or commit

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke GitLab Explorer MCP server tools:

- `Give me an overview of this project.`
- `List all open issues assigned to me.`
- `Get the details for issue #142.`
- `Create a new issue for this bug.`
- `Update this issue's assignee and label.`
- `Show me open merge requests waiting for review.`
- `Get the details for this MR.`
- `Open a new merge request from this branch.`
- `Add a comment to this issue.`
- `What commits have been made in the last week?`
- `Search for issues mentioning this error across my projects.`
- `Show me my projects and team repos.`
- `Why did the pipeline fail on this MR?`
