> Use the Jira MCP server to connect your LLM to Jira with a curated set of tools to search for issues, retrieve details, review comments and activity history, create new issues, update status, and modify issue fields.

# Jira MCP server

The Jira MCP server enables LLMs to explore and manage Jira issues through natural conversation. It provides tools to search for issues, retrieve details, review comments and activity history, create new issues, update status, and modify issue fields without requiring direct interaction with the Jira interface.

The Jira MCP server lets your LLM synthesize information across multiple tickets to identify patterns, summarize comment threads, and highlight dependencies. Your LLM can aggregate customer tickets and surface critical issues for meeting preparation and compile your assignments and recent activity into coherent summaries for standup briefings.

## Uses

Use the Jira MCP server when you plan to perform the following actions:

- Check the status of a specific issue
- Create or update an issue
- Transition an issue to a new status
- Add a comment to an issue
- Get full context on an issue including comments and history
- Find issues by topic, assignee, status, or customer
- View issues assigned to you or a teammate
- Prepare for a customer call by reviewing their open issues
- Update priority status, reassign, or add labels to an issue

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Jira MCP server tools:

- `What's the status of API-1234?`
- `Summarize the payment timeout bug`
- `What do I need to know about API-1234 before my meeting?`
- `Who's working on the login issue?`
- `Summarize API-456`
- `What's the history on API-789?`
- `What decisions were made on API-2323`
- `What issues does Acme Corp have?`
- `Summarize Acme's recent tickets`
- `What's been escalated by Acme?`
- `Give me context before my call with Acme`

## Jira connection setup

View Jira connection setup steps

There are six ways to connect to Jira:

- [API token](#api-token)
- [Service account (API token)](#service-account-api-token)
- [OAuth 2.0 (Cloud - Atlassian-hosted Jira)](#oauth-2-0-cloud)
- [OAuth 2.0 (Data Center)](#oauth-2-0-data-center)
- [Personal access tokens](#personal-access-tokens)
- [Basic authentication (password)](#basic-authentication-with-password)

We strongly recommend using API tokens, service account API tokens, OAuth 2.0, or personal access tokens to connect to Jira instead of basic authentication with a password.

> **LIMITATIONS**
> 
> Authentication methods for the Jira connector have the following limitations:
> 
> - Real-time triggers aren't supported with OAuth 2.0 (Cloud - Atlassian-hosted Jira) or OAuth 2.0 (Data Center).
> - On-prem Jira connections aren't supported with API token or service account (API token) authentication.
> - Atlassian deprecated basic authentication for cloud connections in December 2018. On-premise Jira is not affected.
