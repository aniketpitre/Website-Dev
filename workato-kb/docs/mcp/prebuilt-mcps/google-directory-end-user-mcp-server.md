> Use the Google Directory End User MCP server to connect your LLM to Google Workspace with a curated set of tools to search for colleagues, retrieve profile information, and explore organizational relationships.

# Google Directory End User MCP server

The Google Directory End User MCP server enables LLMs to help you discover people and understand organizational context using Google Workspace directory information through natural conversation. It provides tools to search for colleagues, retrieve profile information, and explore organizational relationships without navigating directory interfaces or admin tools.

The Google Directory End User MCP server helps you answer basic identity and context questions—such as who someone is, what team they're on, or who to contact—by accessing Google Workspace directory information as your system of record for user identities and organizational relationships.

## Uses

Use the Google Directory End User MCP server when you plan to perform the following actions:

- Search for colleagues by name, email, or phone number
- Look up someone's role, department, and contact information
- Find the right person to contact for a specific team or function
- Understand organizational relationships and reporting structures
- Discover profile information for people in your organization
- Browse directory listings to explore your organization's structure

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Google Directory End User MCP server tools:

- `Find Sarah Chen in the directory.`
- `Who is the engineering manager for the mobile team?`
- `Look up the contact information for someone in HR.`
- `What's Maria's job title and department?`
- `Search for people named Alex in the product organization.`
- `Show me everyone in the sales department.`

## Install the Google Directory End User MCP server

Complete the following steps to install a prebuilt MCP server to your project:

1. Sign in to your Workato account.
   
2. Go to **AI Hub > Enterprise MCP > Custom servers**.
   
3. Click **\+ Create MCP server**.
   
4. Go to the **Start with pre-built MCP Servers using your connected apps** section and select the prebuilt MCP server you plan to use.
   
5. Click **Use this server**.
   
6. Provide a name for your MCP server in the **Server name** field.
   
7. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project for the MCP server.
   
8. Go to the **Connections** section and connect to your app account.
   
9. Select the connection type you plan to use for the MCP server template.
   
   - **User's connection**: MCP server tools perform actions based on the identity and permissions of the user who connects to the application. Users authenticate with their own credentials to execute the skill.
   - **Your connection**: This option uses the connection established by the recipe builder and follows the same principles as normal app connections.

## Google Directory connection setup

View Google Directory connection setup steps

The Google Workspace connector supports the following authentication methods:

- [Service account](/en/connectors/google-workspace#service-account)
- [OAuth 2.0](/en/connectors/google-workspace#oauth-2-0)

You can use a service account to authenticate without a personal user account. For consistent use, Workato recommends service account authentication.

You must enable the Google Workspace API to complete the connection setup.

> **REQUIRED SCOPES FOR SERVICE ACCOUNT AUTHENTICATION**
> 
> Ensure that you have the following required permissions to successfully connect to Google Workspace using a service account:
> 
> - `admin.directory.user`
> - `admin.directory.orgunit`
> - `admin.directory.domain`
> - `admin.directory.group`
> - `admin.directory.group.member`
> - `admin.datatransfer`
> - `admin.directory.device.mobile.action`
> - `admin.directory.userschema`
> - `admin.reports.audit.readonly`
> - `admin.reports.usage.readonly`
> - `admin.directory.rolemanagement`
> - `admin.directory.user.security`
> 
> The service account impersonates the user based on the email address you provide during the connection setup after authentication is complete.

### Service account authentication

A Google service account is a specialized Google account associated with a Google Cloud Project (GCP) that can run API requests on your behalf.

Service accounts provide the following benefits:

- **Continuous operation:** Service accounts ensure that operations continue even if individual user permissions change.
- **Dedicated permissions:** Service accounts can only access projects that you share with them.
- **Dedicated API quotas:** You can manage a service account's API quotas through GCP and request quota increases directly from Google.

Refer to the [Google service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) to learn more about service accounts.

## How to use Google Directory End User MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools:

### search\_users tool

The **search\_users** tool searches the Google Workspace directory for users matching the criteria you provide and returns basic identity and organizational information for each matching user. Your LLM uses this tool to find people when you provide partial, ambiguous, or informal references to colleagues.

> **CLARIFY AMBIGUOUS SEARCHES**
> 
> If your search query is likely to return many results, your LLM may ask a clarifying question to narrow down the results (such as department or location).

**Try asking**:

- `Find Sarah Chen in the directory.`
- `Search for people named Alex in engineering.`
- `Look up someone with the email address starting with j.anderson.`
- `Who works in the San Francisco office with 'Manager' in their title?`

### get\_user\_profile tool

The **get\_user\_profile** tool retrieves profile and organizational information for a user by their unique directory identifier. Your LLM uses this tool to provide authoritative identity context after discovering or selecting a person, including profile attributes and organizational relationship information visible in the directory.

**Try asking**:

- `What's Maria Rodriguez's job title and department?`
- `Show me the full profile for sarah.chen@company.com.`
- `Get the contact details and organizational info for Alex Johnson.`
- `Who does Jordan Kim report to and what team are they on?`

### list\_users tool

The **list\_users** tool returns a paginated list of users from the directory. Your LLM uses this tool to browse the directory, explore organizational structure, or get an overview of people in specific departments or locations.

**Try asking**:

- `List all users in the engineering department.`
- `Show me everyone in the New York office.`
- `Give me a list of people in the product organization.`
- `Browse the directory to see who's on the sales team.`
