### MailChimp role requirements

Each tool's availability depends on the authenticating user's MailChimp role. A user without the required role receives a permission-denied outcome rather than a partial result. Refer to the MailChimp [Manage User Levels in Your Account](https://mailchimp.com/help/manage-user-levels-in-your-account/) guide for the complete list of role capabilities.

## How to use MailChimp Marketing Reports MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools:

### list\_audiences tool

The **list\_audiences** tool lists the audiences (lists) in the MailChimp account. Your LLM uses this tool to return audiences with their identifiers, names, and member counts so it can choose the right audience to inspect or analyze, typically before searching contacts or checking audience health for a list that isn't yet resolved.

**Try asking**:

- `Show me all the audiences in my MailChimp account.`
- `Which lists do I have and how many contacts are in each?`
- `Find the audience I should look up for this report.`

### list\_campaigns tool

The **list\_campaigns** tool lists campaigns in the account, with optional status filtering. Your LLM uses this tool to return campaigns with their identifiers, titles, subjects, status, and target audience so it can find a campaign to inspect or analyze, filtering by status when you specify drafts, scheduled, or sent campaigns.

**Try asking**:

- `List my sent campaigns from last month.`
- `Which campaigns are still in draft?`
- `Show me all my scheduled campaigns.`

### get\_campaign tool

The **get\_campaign** tool retrieves a single campaign's settings and content. Your LLM uses this tool to confirm a campaign's subject, sender, recipient audience, status, and current content when you reference a specific campaign, typically before analyzing its performance.

**Try asking**:

- `Show me the details of my launch campaign.`
- `What was the subject and sender on last week's campaign?`
- `What content did I send in this campaign?`

### search\_contacts tool

The **search\_contacts** tool searches for contacts by email or name, optionally within a specific audience. Your LLM uses this tool to confirm whether a contact exists or to resolve a contact's identifier before checking their engagement activity. You can limit the search to a specific audience or search the entire account.

**Try asking**:

- `Find the contact for lee@example.com.`
- `Search for contacts named Smith in my newsletter audience.`
- `Is this person already in my launch list?`

### get\_campaign\_report tool

The **get\_campaign\_report** tool retrieves performance metrics for a sent campaign. Your LLM uses this tool to report opens, clicks, click-through rate, bounces, unsubscribes, and related figures for one sent campaign so you can evaluate how it performed. A report is available only once a campaign has sent.

**Try asking**:

- `How did my launch campaign perform?`
- `What's the open and click rate on last week's newsletter?`
- `Compare the bounce rates on these two sent campaigns.`

### get\_subscriber\_activity tool

The **get\_subscriber\_activity** tool retrieves one contact's engagement activity. Your LLM uses this tool to report a specific contact's opens, clicks, and unsubscribes across campaigns, resolving the audience and contact first if their identifiers are unknown.

**Try asking**:

- `How has lee@example.com engaged with our campaigns?`
- `Show me this subscriber's click history.`
- `Has this contact opened any of our recent emails?`

### get\_audience\_health tool

The **get\_audience\_health** tool retrieves audience growth and aggregated activity over time. Your LLM uses this tool to report recent aggregated activity (signups, unsubscribes, sends, opens, clicks) and month-by-month growth history for a whole audience so you can see whether it's growing and engaged.

**Try asking**:

- `Is my newsletter audience growing?`
- `Show me the engagement trend for my main list.`
- `How healthy is my launch audience right now?`
