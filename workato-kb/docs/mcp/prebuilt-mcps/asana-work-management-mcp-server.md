# Asana Work Management MCP server

The Asana Work Management MCP server enables LLMs to interact with Asana for day-to-day task and project management through natural conversation. It provides tools to create, update, find, and read tasks, see what's assigned to you, make comments, create projects, and post project status updates without requiring direct interaction with the Asana interface.

## Uses

Use the Asana Work Management MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Resolve task, project, user, and team names to their Asana identifiers.
- Retrieve a task's full details, including its direct and inherited project and section memberships.
- See the tasks assigned to you in your My Tasks list.
- Read a task's comment history.
- Search for tasks across the workspace by criteria such as assignee, project, due date, or custom fields.
- Retrieve a project's details, sections, and custom-field schema.
- List the tasks within a project or one of its sections.
- Create tasks and subtasks with a project, section, assignee, and dates.
- Update a task's fields, move it to a different section, or comment on it.
- Create a project, optionally with an associated team, initial sections, and team access, and post status updates to it.

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Asana Work Management MCP server tools:

- `Find the "Website Redesign" project.`
- `Show me the details for the "Draft press release" task.`
- `List the tasks in the "In Progress" section of the Website Redesign project.`
- `Create a task called "Draft press release" in the Website Redesign project, due next Friday.`
- `Move the "Draft press release" task to the Done section.`
- `Add a comment to the "Draft press release" task saying it's ready for review.`
- `Search for incomplete tasks assigned to Jade Chen in the Website Redesign project.`
- `Create a new project called "Q4 Marketing Campaign" with sections for Backlog, In Progress, and Done.`

#### Asana role requirements

Each tool's availability depends on the permissions granted to the connected account. A request made without the required permission returns a permission-denied outcome rather than a partial result. Refer to the Asana [OAuth scopes](https://developers.asana.com/docs/oauth-scopes) and [project permissions](https://help.asana.com/s/article/individual-project-permissions?language=en_US) documentation for more information. **search\_tasks** additionally requires the authenticated user to have search entitlement from a premium Asana workspace or membership on a premium team.

### Project property configuration

The Asana Work Management MCP server supports the following project-level properties to control behavior and defaults:

| Project-level property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace GID | Required. Enter the globally unique identifier (GID) of the Asana workspace or organization in which all tools operate. |
| Default page size | Enter a default page size to apply to every tool that returns paged results, including the paginated components for subtasks, sections, and custom fields. The default value is 50 and the maximum is 100. |
| Search cursor TTL | Enter how long the opaque search continuation cursor used by **search\_tasks** remains valid. Defaults to 300 seconds. |

## How to use Asana Work Management MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools:

### find\_objects tool

The **find\_objects** tool resolves a name to matching Asana objects and their IDs. Your LLM uses this tool first when you refer to a task, project, person, or team by name and its ID is unknown. Your LLM asks you to disambiguate when several results match or when matching results aren't found.

**Try asking**:

- `Look up the user Jade Chen.`
- `Find the "Engineering" team.`

### get\_task tool

The **get\_task** tool returns the full details of a single task, including direct and effective memberships. Your LLM uses this tool when you ask for a specific task's details or subtasks. **get\_task** relies on the connection's effective memberships to understand the project context a subtask inherits.

**Try asking**:

- `Show me the details for the "Draft press release" task.`
- `What are the subtasks on this task?`
- `Which projects and sections is this task part of?`

### get\_my\_tasks tool

The **get\_my\_tasks** tool returns the tasks in the authenticated user's My Tasks list. Your LLM uses this tool to track "to-do" items. **get\_my\_tasks** returns incomplete tasks assigned to you by default.

**Try asking**:

- `Show me my to-do list.`
- `What tasks are assigned to me, including completed ones?`

### get\_project tool

- `What sections does the Website Redesign project have?`
- `Find the "Done" section in the Website Redesign project.`
- `List the columns on this project's board.`

### get\_project\_custom\_fields tool

The **get\_project\_custom\_fields** tool returns the custom-field schema associated with a project. Your LLM uses this tool to resolve a custom field you name to its ID and subtype before setting or filtering by the ID.

### search\_tasks tool

The **search\_tasks** tool searches tasks across the workspace using full-text and typed filters. Your LLM uses this tool to find tasks by criteria, such as text, assignee, project or section, due or created dates, and custom fields, when advanced task search is available to you.

**Try asking**:

- `Search for incomplete tasks assigned to Jade Chen in the Website Redesign project.`
- `Find tasks due before next Friday in the Website Redesign project.`
- `Search the workspace for tasks mentioning "launch plan".`

### create\_task tool

The **create\_task** tool creates a new task or subtask. Your LLM uses this tool to capture a task with a name, description, assignee, project, section, and dates, or to create a subtask by supplying a parent task.

**Try asking**:

- `Create a task called "Draft press release" in the Website Redesign project, due next Friday.`
- `Add a subtask to this task for reviewing the copy.`
- `Create a task assigned to Dana Park in the "Backlog" section of the Website Redesign project.`

### update\_task tool

**Try asking**:

- `Create a new project called "Q4 Marketing Campaign" with sections for Backlog, In Progress, and Done.`
- `Set up a project for the new initiative and share it with the Engineering team.`
- `Create a private project called "Internal Audit".`

### publish\_status\_update tool

The **publish\_status\_update** tool posts a status update to a project. Your LLM uses this tool when you need to notify a project's followers with a status update that includes a status type, title, and body.

**Try asking**:

- `Post a status update on the Website Redesign project marking it on track.`
- `Update the status of this project to "at risk" with a summary of the blockers.`
