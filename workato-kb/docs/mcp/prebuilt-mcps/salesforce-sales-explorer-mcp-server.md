## Salesforce connection setup

View Salesforce connection setup steps

Workato supports OAuth 2.0 authentication and JWT bearer authentication connections for Salesforce Sales Explorer.

### OAuth 2.0 authentication

View OAuth 2.0 authentication steps

#### Connect to Salesforce using OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Grant)

Complete the following steps to set up an OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Grant) connection to Salesforce in Workato:

> **OAUTH RESTRICTIONS**
> 
> As of early September 2025, Salesforce restricts the use of uninstalled Salesforce Connected Apps. Refer to [OAuth restrictions](/en/connectors/salesforce#oauth-restrictions) for required actions if you encounter errors when you create a new connection. These steps are required for all new Salesforce connections starting **September 17, 2025**.

1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `Salesforce` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name in the **Connection name** field.
   
   ![Salesforce connection setup](/assets/connect.CnntY3nd.png)_OAuth2.0 Salesforce connection setup_
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Use the **Auth type** drop-down menu to select **OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Grant)**.
   
6. Use the **Sandbox** drop-down menu to specify whether the Salesforce account is a sandbox account.
   
7. Optional. Expand **Advanced settings** to configure the following options:
   
   Advanced settings
   
   - **Organization/community custom domain URL**: Enter the URL to your Salesforce community's custom domain. Required for community connections with unique domains.
   - **Requested permissions**: Select [permissions](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_oauth_scopes.htm&type=5) to request for this connection. Refer to [Requested scopes](/en/connectors/salesforce#oauth2-scopes) for the scopes Workato requests.
   - **Verified user access configuration**: Configure custom auth for personal connections. Refer to [Runtime user connections](/en/features/runtime-user-connections) for more information.
   
   > **REFRESH TOKEN SCOPE IS REQUIRED**
   > 
   > The **Perform requests at any time (`refresh_token`, `offline_access`)** scope is one of the scopes Workato requests for OAuth 2.0 connections, but whether Salesforce actually grants this scope depends on the Connected App's own OAuth policies, not on the Workato connection's settings. Refer to [Salesforce connection disconnects repeatedly](/en/connectors/salesforce/troubleshoot-connection-setup#salesforce-connection-disconnects-repeatedly) if your connection later disconnects when the access token expires. A Refresh Token Policy or IP Relaxation setting can cause the same symptom.
   
8. Optional. Use the **Custom OAuth profile** drop-down menu to select a custom OAuth profile for your connection. Refer to [Create a custom OAuth profile for Salesforce](/en/connectors/salesforce/custom-oauth) for more information.
   
9. Click **Connect**.
   
10. Optional. If your Salesforce organization or community uses a custom domain, complete the following in the sign-in modal:
    
    - Click **Use Custom Domain**.
    - Enter your **Custom domain**, then click **Continue**.
    
    ![Salesforce custom domains](/assets/connection-custom-domain.D3hJN8X8.png)_Enter your Custom domain._
    
11. Enter your Salesforce **Username** and **Password**.
    
    ![Salesforce connection setup](/assets/login.CIu5oc0P.png)_Log in to your Salesforce account_
    
12. Click **Log In** to complete the setup.
    
    > **OAUTH\_APPROVAL\_ERROR\_GENERIC**
    > 
    > If you see this error, Salesforce is restricting the Workato app because it isn't installed. A Salesforce admin must install the app in **Connected Apps OAuth Usage** or assign the Salesforce permissions. Refer to [OAuth restrictions](/en/connectors/salesforce#oauth-restrictions) for details.
    

### JWT bearer authentication

View JWT bearer authentication steps

> **ACTIONS ON BEHALF OF USER**
> 
> JWT connections can perform actions on behalf of a user you specify using the **On-behalf-of-user email** field. Contact your Workato Customer Success Manager to enable this feature.

#### How it works

JWT bearer authentication connects using a digital certificate that signs a JWT request. Workato sends a JWT to the Salesforce OAuth token endpoint, where Salesforce processes the JWT and issues an access token based on prior approval of Workato in Salesforce.

Although JWT bearer skips interactive sign-in, Salesforce still evaluates every request against the permissions of the user specified in the connection and attributes any changes to that user. Use a dedicated integration user rather than a personal account.

Refer to [Required roles and permissions](/en/connectors/salesforce#roles-and-permissions-required-to-connect) for the Salesforce permissions the connected user needs.

#### Generate a private key and certificate

JWT bearer authentication requires a private key and a certificate. The following command generates both using OpenSSL. Replace the `-subj` values with your own:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout server.key \
  -out server.crt \
  -days 365 \
  -subj "/CN=Your App Name/O=Your Organization/C=US"
```

This generates two files:

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `server.key` | Your private key for Workato. Keep this secret. |
| `server.crt` | Your public certificate for Salesforce. |

Refer to Salesforce's documentation for more information:

- [OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Flow for Server-to-Server Integration](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.remoteaccess_oauth_jwt_flow.htm&language=en_US&type=5): Details on how Salesforce uses this certificate to sign and validate JWTs.
- [Create a Private Key and Self-Signed Digital Certificate](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_key_and_cert.htm): Other ways to generate a private key and certificate.

#### Create an external client app for JWT bearer

JWT bearer authentication also requires a registered external client app in Salesforce. Complete the following steps before creating your connection in Workato. Refer to Salesforce's [Create an External Client App](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.create_a_local_external_client_app.htm&language=en_US&type=5) documentation for more information.
