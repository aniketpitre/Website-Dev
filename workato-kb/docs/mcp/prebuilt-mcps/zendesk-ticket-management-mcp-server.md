## Install the Zendesk MCP server

Complete the following steps to install a prebuilt MCP server to your project:

1. Sign in to your Workato account.
   
2. Go to **AI Hub > Enterprise MCP > Custom servers**.
   
3. Click **\+ Create MCP server**.
   
4. Go to the **Start with pre-built MCP Servers using your connected apps** section and select the prebuilt MCP server you plan to use.
   
5. Click **Use this server**.
   
6. Provide a name for your MCP server in the **Server name** field.
   
7. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project for the MCP server.
   
8. Go to the **Connections** section and connect to your app account.
   
9. Select the connection type you plan to use for the MCP server template.
   
   - **User's connection**: MCP server tools perform actions based on the identity and permissions of the user who connects to the application. Users authenticate with their own credentials to execute the skill.
   - **Your connection**: This option uses the connection established by the recipe builder and follows the same principles as normal app connections.
   
   ![Select your connection type](/assets/connection-type.Cor-6PJN.png)_Select your connection type_
   
   > **VERIFIED USER ACCESS AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENTS**
   > 
   > Only app connections that use OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant are available for user's connection. Refer to [Verified user access](/en/mcp/verified-user-access) for more information.
   
10. Complete the app-specific connection setup steps in the following section.
    

## Zendesk connection setup

View Zendesk connection setup steps

The Zendesk connector uses OAuth 2.0 authentication.

> **DEPRECATED AUTHENTICATION METHODS**
> 
> Effective March 31, 2026, you can no longer create new Zendesk connections using Basic authentication or Custom OAuth profiles. This change is required by [Zendesk Developer Terms](https://www.zendesk.com/company/agreements-and-terms/zendesk-developer-terms/).
> 
> Existing connections using these authentication methods will continue to work until **April 30, 2027**. On this date, Zendesk connections still using Basic authentication or a Custom OAuth profile will be terminated, and recipes relying on these connections will stop functioning.

Complete the following steps to connect to Zendesk in Workato:

1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `Zendesk` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
   
   ![Connect to Zendesk with OAuth 2.0](/assets/oauth2.CJ5g3KV-.png)_Connect to Zendesk with OAuth 2.0_
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Enter your Zendesk subdomain in the **Subdomain** field. For example, your subdomain is `acme` if your Zendesk URL is `https://acme.zendesk.com`.
   
6. Click **Connect**.
   
7. Sign in to Zendesk using your credentials to authorize Workato.
   

### Project property configuration

You must configure the **ZENDESK\_SLA\_VIEW** for your Zendesk Ticket Management MCP server at the project level. **ZENDESK\_SLA\_VIEW** is used for the `list_overdue_tickets` tool. You can configure this setting to operate in deterministic or efficient mode. Deterministic mode scans for `SLA-breached` tickets while efficient mode scans for `SLA-nearing tickets`. Zendesk admins must configure Zendesk View IDs for SLA-breached or SLA-nearing tickets. The `list_overdue_tickets` tool queries the View IDs directly when you set the project property in Workato and View IDs are configured and accessible in Zendesk.

The `list_overdue_tickets` tool scans unsolved tickets using Search API with SLA sideloading and filters results by SLA metrics if you don't set the **ZENDESK\_SLA\_VIEW** project property. This fallback is bounded by page and record caps and may return partial results in large accounts.

Complete the following steps to configure your SLA view:

View Project property configuration steps

1. Sign in to your Workato account and go to **Projects**.
   
2. Go to the project that contains your MCP server.
   
3. Click the **Settings** tab.
   
   ![Click the Settings tab](/assets/project-settings.99X6TiYd.png)_Click the **Settings** tab._
   
4. Select **Project properties**.
   
5. Go to the **ZENDESK\_SLA\_VIEW** property and click the **Edit** (pencil) icon.
   
   ![Click the Edit (pencil) icon](/assets/zendesk-sla-view-project-property.CmKKHSw3.png)_Click the **Edit** (pencil) icon._
   
6. Go to the **Value** field and enter your Zendesk SLA view. For example, `SLA-Breached Tickets` or `SLA-nearing tickets`.
