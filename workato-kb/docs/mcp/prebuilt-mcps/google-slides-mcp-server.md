The Google Slides connector supports the following authentication methods:

- [OAuth 2.0](#oauth-2-0)
- [Service account](#service-account)

> **SERVICE ACCOUNT AUTHENTICATION**
> 
> You can use a service account to authenticate without a personal user account. For consistent use, Workato recommends service account authentication.

#### OAuth 2.0

View OAuth 2.0 steps

OAuth 2.0 authentication requires that you add the following redirect URI to your credentials in the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/): `https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback`

Complete the following steps to set up an OAuth 2.0 connection:

1. Click **Create > Connection**.

#### Service account

View Service account steps

A Google service account is a specialized Google account associated with a Google Cloud Project (GCP) that can run API requests on your behalf.

Service accounts provide the following benefits:

- **Continuous operation:** Service accounts ensure that operations continue even if individual user permissions change.
- **Dedicated permissions:** Service accounts can only access projects that you share with them.
- **Dedicated API quotas:** You can manage a service account's API quotas through GCP and request quota increases directly from Google.

Refer to the [Google service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) to learn more about service accounts.

> **SERVICE ACCOUNT REQUIREMENTS**
> 
> Service account authentication has the following requirements:
> 
> - [Enable the Google Slides API](https://console.developers.google.com/) in your Google Cloud project.
>   
> - Ensure the email associated with your service account has access to the Google Slides presentations used in recipes. You can share presentations directly from the Google Slides UI.
>   

##### Set up a Google service account
