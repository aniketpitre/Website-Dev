> Use the Excel MCP server to connect your LLM to Microsoft Excel with a curated set of tools to read, update, and manage workbooks and tabular data stored in Microsoft 365.

# Excel MCP server

The Excel MCP server enables LLMs to read, update, and structurally modify Microsoft Excel workbooks stored in Microsoft 365 through natural conversation. It provides tools to access tabular data, append and update rows, manage worksheets, and perform atomic multi-step updates without requiring direct interaction with the Excel interface.

## Uses

Use the Excel MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Retrieve workbook metadata including worksheet names and Excel Tables
- Read cell data, formulas, and table contents from worksheets
- Append new rows to trackers or data tables
- Update specific cell values or formulas in ranges
- Perform atomic multi-step updates that must succeed or fail together
- Add new worksheets to workbooks
- Rename existing worksheets
- Delete worksheets when explicitly requested
- Access named ranges and Excel Table definitions

### Example prompts

- `What worksheets are in my Sales Tracker workbook?`
- `Read the data from the Q1 Revenue sheet.`
- `Add these three deals to my Pipeline tracker.`
- `Update the status column to 'Closed Won' for the Acme Corp row.`
- `Create a new January 2026 tab and add headers.`
- `Rename Sheet1 to 'Sales Pipeline'.`
- `Get the current session ID for this workbook.`
- `Show me the data in the Revenue table.`

### Authorization code grant authentication (OAuth 2.0)

View authorization code grant authentication steps

This authentication method requires the following value for tenant-specific account types:

- Tenant ID/Domain

#### Minimum and default scopes

View minimum and default scopes

The Excel connector requests the following scopes for authorization code grant connections by default. These scopes are necessary to use all of this connector's triggers and actions. Additionally, you must assign these permissions to the Workato app as **Delegated** permissions in the Azure portal.

| Permission | Description | Relevant action or trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Files.Read` | Allows the app to read the signed-in user's files. | Get cells, Get rows, List tables, List worksheets, and Search workbooks |
| `Files.ReadWrite` | Allows the app to read and write to the signed-in user's files. | All actions in `Files.Read` and Add a table, Add a worksheet, Add rows in batch, Delete row, and Update row. |
| `Group.Read.All` | Allows the app to read files for all groups the signed-in user can access. | Get cells, Get rows, List tables, List worksheets, and Search workbooks |
| `Sites.Read.All` | Allows the app to read documents in all SharePoint site collections on behalf of the signed-in user. | Get cells, Get rows, List tables, List worksheets, and Search workbooks |
| `Sites.ReadWrite.All` | Allows the app to read and write to documents in all SharePoint site collections on behalf of the signed-in user. On the consent page, this scope appears as the `Maintain access to data you have given it access to` permission. | All actions in `Sites.Read.All` and Add a table, Add a worksheet, Add rows in batch, Delete row, and Update row. Add this permission for all actions to preserve the connection's validity. |
| `User.Read` | Allows the app to sign in and read the profile of signed-in users. | Add this permission for all actions. |
| `offline_access` | Allows the app to access Microsoft Graph data after the user has signed out or the session has expired. | You must add this permission to establish a connection. |

To limit the connection to specific SharePoint sites instead of all sites, add the following scope:

- `Sites.Selected`

This scope doesn't grant your app access to any sites by itself. A SharePoint or Global admin must grant your app access to each site you plan to use. After access is granted, Excel actions can work with files on that site. Refer to [Grant site access for Sites.Selected](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-sharepoint#grant-site-access-for-sites-selected) for more information.

When you use `Sites.Selected`, file and table pick lists show only the files that the connected user can access.

You must add the following minimum scopes to establish a connection to Excel with authorization code grant authentication:

- `Files.Read`
- `offline_access`
- `User.Read`

## How to use Excel MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools:

### get\_workbook\_info tool

The **get\_workbook\_info** tool retrieves worksheet names, named ranges, Excel Table definitions, and session metadata for a workbook. Your LLM uses this tool to find worksheet names or identifiers, the current `session_id` before any write action, information about named ranges or Excel Tables, or confirmation of structure before planning updates.

**Try asking**:

- `What worksheets are in my Sales Tracker workbook?`
- `Show me the structure of the Q4 Planning workbook.`
- `What Excel Tables exist in this workbook?`
- `Get the session ID for my Pipeline tracker.`

### get\_workbook\_content tool

The **get\_workbook\_content** tool retrieves bounded cell data, formulas, and table contents from ranges or worksheets you specify. Your LLM uses this tool to read values or formulas, understand workbook contents, retrieve tables or ranges for analysis, or get current values before an update.

**Try asking**:

- `Read the data from the Q1 Revenue sheet.`
- `Show me the values in cells A1 through E10.`
- `Get the contents of the Pipeline table.`
- `What's in the Sales worksheet?`

### append\_rows tool

The **append\_rows** tool appends one or more rows of data to an existing worksheet or Excel Table. Your LLM uses this tool to add new entries to a tracker or table, log operational records over time, or reserve empty rows before population.

**Try asking**:

- `Add these three deals to my Pipeline tracker.`
- `Append today's sales data to the Revenue sheet.`
- `Log these customer records in the CRM table.`
- `Add a new row to the expense tracker with Date: 1/15/2026, Amount: $250.`

### update\_range\_values tool

The **update\_range\_values** tool updates values or formulas in a range or Excel Table you specify. Your LLM uses this tool to update specific values, correct or replace values in a range, write or update formulas, or populate previously appended empty rows.

**Try asking**:

- `Update the status column to 'Closed Won' for the Acme Corp row.`
- `Change the Q4 forecast in cell B12 to $450,000.`
- `Set the priority to 'High' for rows 5 through 8.`
- `Update the formula in cell D2 to calculate the total.`

### batch\_update tool

The **batch\_update** tool applies multiple workbook updates as a single atomic change. Your LLM uses this tool only when atomicity matters, such as appending rows and populating formulas where partial application would leave the workbook inconsistent, or creating a worksheet and initializing it with headers and values as one change.

**Try asking**:

- `Create a new January 2026 tab and add headers in one update.`
- `Append these entries and update the summary totals together.`
- `Add rows and calculate their totals in a single atomic change.`
- `Initialize the new sheet with headers and formulas at once.`

### add\_worksheet tool

The **add\_worksheet** tool adds a new worksheet (tab) to an existing workbook. Your LLM uses this tool to create a new tab or add a worksheet for a new reporting period or tracking category.

**Try asking**:

- `Add a new tab called 'January 2026' to my monthly tracker.`
- `Create a new worksheet named 'Archive'.`
- `Add a 'Completed Tasks' tab to the project tracker.`
- `Insert a new sheet for Q2 metrics.`

### rename\_worksheet tool

The **rename\_worksheet** tool renames an existing worksheet (tab) in a workbook. Your LLM uses this tool to rename a tab or standardize worksheet naming.

**Try asking**:

- `Rename Sheet1 to 'Sales Pipeline'.`
- `Change the 'January' tab name to 'January 2026'.`
- `Rename the 'Temp' sheet to 'Archive'.`
- `Update the sheet name from 'Data' to 'Q1 Revenue'.`

### delete\_worksheet tool

The **delete\_worksheet** tool deletes an existing worksheet (tab) from a workbook. Your LLM uses this tool to delete a worksheet.

**Try asking**:

- `Delete the 'Archive' tab from my tracker.`
- `Remove the 'Old Data' sheet from the workbook.`
- `Delete Sheet2 since we don't need it anymore.`
- `Remove the 'Scratch' worksheet.`
