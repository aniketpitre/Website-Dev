# Microsoft To Do MCP server

The Microsoft To Do MCP server enables LLMs to manage personal tasks in Microsoft To Do using natural conversation. It provides tools to capture, find, update, and organize tasks with semantic filters, manage checklist steps, and complete work without requiring direct interaction with the Microsoft To Do interface.

## Uses

Use the Microsoft To Do MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Capture tasks from conversations and set due dates, reminders, recurrence, importance, and categories
- Retrieve and triage tasks due today, due this week, or marked as important
- Search for tasks by keyword across all your task lists
- Break tasks into checklist steps and complete individual steps
- Reschedule tasks, change recurrence, update importance, and add notes
- Complete recurring tasks and automatically create the next occurrence
- Create and manage multiple task lists
- Access tasks from flagged emails in your Flagged Emails list
- Organize tasks by categories and importance levels
- Delete tasks you no longer need

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Microsoft To Do MCP server tools:

- `Add a task to follow up with the vendor by Friday.`
- `What's due today?`
- `Show me all high-importance tasks due this week.`
- `Break the contract review into steps: legal review, stakeholder feedback, finalization.`
- `Mark the first two steps of the launch task as done.`
- `Push the Q4 planning meeting task to next Tuesday at 2pm.`
- `What tasks did I flag in email?`
- `Search for the vendor follow-up task.`
- `Make the standup recurring weekly on Mondays.`

### Microsoft To Do access requirements

All tools require a Microsoft 365 work or school account with an Exchange Online-backed mailbox. Microsoft To Do requires no premium tier. The server connects using delegated OAuth 2.0 authorization and acts only as the signed-in user. It supports no cross-user or administrative operations.

## How to use Microsoft To Do MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools:

### list\_task\_lists tool

The **list\_task\_lists** tool lists every task list in your account, including the default Tasks list and the Flagged Emails list. Your LLM uses this tool to discover your available lists and resolve a list name to its ID before creating or filtering tasks. On accounts with a very large number of lists, a single call may not return every list, so ask for a specific list by name if it's missing from the full listing.

**Try asking**:

- `What task lists do I have?`
- `Show me my lists.`
- `Do I have a vendor contracts list?`

### create\_task\_list tool

The **create\_task\_list** tool creates a new task list under your account. The tool returns an existing list if one with the name you provide already exists. Creating a duplicate list requires your explicit confirmation. Your LLM uses this tool to set up a new list on request.

**Try asking**:

- `Create a list called Client Renewals.`
- `Make a new list for the offsite planning.`
- `Add a list for new hire onboarding.`

### list\_tasks tool

The **list\_tasks** tool retrieves tasks from one list or across your entire account, filtered by status, due date, and importance. Your LLM uses this tool to triage what's due and plan your day without building a raw query.

**Try asking**:

- `What's due today?`
- `Show me what's overdue.`
- `What's on my plate this week?`
- `Any important tasks I'm missing?`
- `What's due by Friday?`

### search\_tasks tool

The **search\_tasks** tool searches for tasks by keyword across your task lists, matching against task titles and notes. Your LLM uses this tool to locate a task from a description.

**Try asking**:

- `Find the vendor follow-up task.`
- `Where did I put the contract review?`
- `Do I have anything about the Q4 planning?`

### get\_task tool

The **get\_task** tool retrieves everything recorded for one task, including its checklist steps and any linked resources, such as the email a flagged task came from. Your LLM uses this tool to read current state before editing or to answer detailed questions about a task.

**Try asking**:

- `What are the steps on the launch task?`
- `Show me the details of the contract review task.`
- `What's the due date and steps for this task?`

### create\_task tool

The **create\_task** tool creates a task with the properties your LLM provides, including title, notes, due date, reminder, start date, importance, categories, and recurrence. It records exactly what's stated, without inferring or adding anything you didn't ask for. Your LLM uses this tool to capture tasks from conversation and to deposit follow-ups from other systems.

**Try asking**:

- `Remind me to send the vendor follow-up Friday.`
- `Add a task to renew the software license.`
- `I need to review the contract before the 25th, high priority.`
- `Schedule a weekly standup reminder for Mondays at 9am.`

### update\_task tool

The **update\_task** tool updates any property of an existing task, including its due date, reminder, recurrence, importance, categories, or status. Only the fields you provide change, and every other property stays exactly as it was. Your LLM uses this tool to reschedule a task, edit its details, change its importance, or reopen one you completed by mistake.

**Try asking**:

- `Push the report task to next Tuesday.`
- `Make the standup recurring weekly.`
- `Change that to high priority.`
- `Add a note about the stakeholder feedback.`

### complete\_task tool

The **complete\_task** tool marks a task complete. For recurring tasks, it also creates the next occurrence. The tool preserves the completed task and its history instead of deleting it. You can reopen it later with `update_task` if needed. Your LLM uses this tool to mark a task done whenever you say it's finished.

**Try asking**:

- `Mark it done.`
- `Check off the weekly standup.`
- `That's finished.`

### delete\_task tool

The **delete\_task** tool permanently deletes a task and its checklist items. It takes no action until you explicitly confirm the deletion. Your LLM uses this tool to remove a task you've asked to delete.

**Try asking**:

- `Delete that duplicate task.`
- `Remove the outdated vendor task.`
- `Get rid of that one.`

### add\_checklist\_items tool

The **add\_checklist\_items** tool adds one or more checklist steps to a task in a single call. It reports success or failure for each step independently, so a failed step doesn't affect the remaining steps. Your LLM uses this tool to break a task down into steps or add steps you specify.

**Try asking**:

- `Break the contract review into steps.`
- `Add these steps to the launch task: marketing review, QA sign-off, release notes.`
- `Make a checklist for the presentation prep.`

### update\_checklist\_item tool

The **update\_checklist\_item** tool makes exactly one change to a single step per call. Your LLM uses this tool to complete, reword, or remove an individual step without touching the parent task.

**Try asking**:

- `Mark the first step done.`
- `Check off the legal review.`
- `Reword that step to be clearer.`
