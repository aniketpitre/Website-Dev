> Use the Microsoft PowerPoint MCP server to connect your LLM to Microsoft PowerPoint with content retrieval, slide structure manipulation, targeted text updates, and speaker notes management.

# Microsoft PowerPoint MCP server

The Microsoft PowerPoint MCP server enables LLMs to interact with Microsoft PowerPoint for presentation content and structure management through natural conversation. It provides tools to read and summarize slide content, manipulate presentation structure, update text, and manage speaker notes without requiring direct interaction with the Microsoft PowerPoint interface.

## Uses

Use the Microsoft PowerPoint MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Retrieve presentation metadata and structural overview.
- Read and summarize slide content, including text elements and speaker notes.
- Inspect individual slide elements for targeted operations.
- List available slide layouts for adding new slides.
- Add, delete, and copy slides to build presentations.
- Update text content on specific slides.
- Perform find-and-replace across entire presentations.
- Generate and add speaker notes.

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Microsoft PowerPoint MCP server tools:

- `Summarize my Q4 board presentation.`
- `Update the date on slide 1 to January 2026.`
- `What are the key points in the investor deck?`
- `Change the revenue figure from $2.3M to $2.5M on slide 7.`
- `Give me talking points for slides 5-10.`
- `Replace all instances of 'Q3' with 'Q4'.`
- `Add a new slide after the roadmap section for Q2 priorities.`
- `Delete the case study slides and add two more comparison slides.`
- `Generate speaker notes for my board presentation.`

### Project property configuration

The Microsoft PowerPoint MCP server supports the following project-level properties to control behavior and defaults:

| Project-level property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Maximum slides per read request | Limits the number of slides returned by **get\_slide\_content** in a single call. Retrieve slides in batches using the `slide_numbers` parameter for presentations that exceed this quota. Defaults to `50`. |
| Maximum presentation file size | Limits the accepted file size of presentations. Defaults to `100` MB. Presentations exceeding this size return an error on any read or write operation. |
| Maximum speaker notes length per slide | Limits the size of the `notes_content` parameter in **update\_speaker\_notes**. Notes exceeding this quota are rejected. Defaults to `5,000` characters. |
| Maximum find-and-replace operations | Limits the number of replacements per **find\_and\_replace\_text** call. The operation is rejected if more instances match than this quota. Defaults to `1,000`. |
| Write conflict policy | Controls conflict detection and retry. Before a server uploads a modified file, it checks whether the file's last-modified timestamp changed since the last download. The server returns a conflict error rather than overwriting concurrent changes. |
| Response truncation policy | Controls response truncation. Text content from individual elements returns up to `10,000` characters per element. Tables return up to `50` rows. Speaker notes return up to `5,000` characters per slide. Content beyond these quotas is truncated with an indicator. |

## How to use Microsoft PowerPoint MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools:

### get\_presentation tool

The **get\_presentation** tool retrieves metadata and structural overview of a PowerPoint presentation. Your LLM uses this tool as the first step before any content retrieval or modification to understand a presentation's scope. This tool returns a presentation's title, slide count, dimensions, author, and modification history.

**Try asking**:

- `How many slides are in my Q4 board deck?`
- `When was this presentation last modified and by whom?`
- `What are the slide dimensions for this deck?`

### get\_slide\_content tool

The **get\_slide\_content** tool extracts text content from specified slides including text elements and speaker notes. Your LLM uses this tool when a user wants to understand slide content, needs a summary, or is preparing for a presentation. This tool retrieves either all slides or slides you specify.

**Try asking**:

- `Summarize the content of slides 5 through 10.`
- `What does the executive summary slide say?`
- `Read the speaker notes for my entire presentation.`
- `Pull the text from every slide so I can review it.`

### get\_slide\_elements tool

The **get\_slide\_elements** tool lists all elements on a specific slide with type, position, size, and content preview. Your LLM uses this tool before **update\_text\_content** to identify the correct element for modification and to disambiguate when content appears in multiple elements.

**Try asking**:

- `List all the elements on slide 3.`
- `Which text boxes are on the title slide?`
- `Show me the placeholders on slide 7 so I can update one.`
- `What elements appear on the comparison slide?`

### list\_layouts tool

The **list\_layouts** tool returns available slide layouts from the presentation's masters with placeholder information. Your LLM uses this tool before **add\_slide** to discover what layouts exist and help the user choose appropriate structure. This tool retrieves layout names, types, and placeholders as a flat list.

**Try asking**:

- `What slide layouts are available in this presentation?`
- `Show me the layouts I can use to add a new slide.`
- `Which layout should I use for a section header?`
- `List the placeholders for each available layout.`

### add\_slide tool

The **add\_slide** tool inserts a new slide with the specified layout at a given position. Your LLM uses this tool to build and extend presentation structure.

**Try asking**:

- `Add a new slide after the roadmap section for Q2 priorities.`
- `Insert a Title and Content slide at position 4.`
- `Append a section header slide to the end of the deck.`
- `Add two more comparison slides to this presentation.`

### delete\_slide tool

The **delete\_slide** tool removes one or more slides from a presentation. Your LLM uses this tool to clean up templates, remove placeholder slides, and restructure. This tool confirms the target slide numbers with the user before deletion.

**Try asking**:

- `Delete the case study slides from this deck.`
- `Remove slide 8.`
- `Delete slides 3, 4, and 5.`
- `Clean up the placeholder example slides in this template.`

### copy\_slide tool

The **copy\_slide** tool duplicates a slide within the same presentation. Your LLM uses this tool to create variations, repeat structures, or iterate on content. You can specify a location to insert the copy.

**Try asking**:

- `Duplicate slide 6.`
- `Make a copy of the pricing slide and place it after slide 10.`
- `Copy the template slide so I can build a variation.`
- `Repeat the customer overview slide later in the deck.`

### update\_text\_content tool

The **update\_text\_content** tool updates text within a specific element on a slide. Your LLM uses this tool to make targeted edits such as changing dates, updating numbers, or fixing text. This tool identifies the element by element ID or by matching existing text.

**Try asking**:

- `Update the date on slide 1 to January 2026.`
- `Change the revenue figure from $2.3M to $2.5M on slide 7.`
- `Fix the typo on slide 12 — change 'teh' to 'the'.`
- `Replace the title on the opening slide with "Acme Corp QBR".`

### find\_and\_replace\_text tool

The **find\_and\_replace\_text** tool performs find-and-replace across all slides in a presentation. Your LLM uses this tool for bulk updates such as changing dates throughout, fixing repeated terms, or updating terminology. The tool returns the count and location of replacements.

**Try asking**:

- `Replace all instances of 'Q3' with 'Q4'.`
- `Change every mention of "2025" to "2026" across the deck.`
- `Update the company name everywhere it appears.`
- `Find and replace "Beta" with "GA" throughout the presentation.`

### update\_speaker\_notes tool

The **update\_speaker\_notes** tool sets or replaces the speaker notes content for a specific slide. Your LLM uses this tool after generating notes from slide content or when the user provides talking points. This tool confirms with the user before overwriting existing content.

**Try asking**:

- `Generate speaker notes for my board presentation.`
- `Add talking points to slides 5 through 10.`
- `Write presenter notes for the financial summary slide.`
- `Replace the speaker notes on slide 2 with these talking points.`
