# ZoomInfo B2B Intelligence MCP server

The ZoomInfo B2B Intelligence MCP server enables LLMs to search and enrich B2B company and contact data from ZoomInfo through natural conversation. It provides tools to find companies and contacts, discover accounts showing buying intent, enrich records with full profiles, retrieve intent signals, news, scoops, corporate hierarchy, organization charts, and technology stacks without requiring direct interaction with the ZoomInfo interface.

ZoomInfo operates on a credit-based model where search operations return free previews and enrichment operations consume credits. The server enforces a strict preview-then-enrich pattern in which search tools return identification-level data at no cost, and enrichment tools consume credits only when you explicitly approve.

## Uses

Use the ZoomInfo B2B Intelligence MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Look up valid filter values for search and enrichment parameters
- Check current API credit balance and usage quotas
- Search companies by firmographic and technographic criteria
- Search contacts by title, seniority, department, and company attributes
- Discover companies showing buying intent for specified topics
- Enrich a company record with its full ZoomInfo profile
- Enrich a contact record with full profile details
- Retrieve intent signals and recommended contacts for a known company
- Get recent news articles and proprietary scoops for a company
