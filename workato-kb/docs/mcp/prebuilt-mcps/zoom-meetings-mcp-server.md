# Zoom Meetings MCP server

The Zoom Meetings MCP server enables LLMs to interact with Zoom meeting functionality through natural conversation. It provides tools to search for past meetings, retrieve recordings and transcripts, check attendance, and create or update meetings without requiring direct interaction with the Zoom interface.

## Uses

Use the Zoom Meetings MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Search for past meetings you've hosted or attended
- Retrieve detailed information about specific meetings
- Access cloud recording links for meetings
- Retrieve auto-generated transcripts for meeting review
- Check who attended a meeting and for how long
- Create new scheduled Zoom meetings
- Update existing scheduled meetings

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Zoom Meetings MCP server tools:

- `Find my meetings with Mei from last week.`
- `Get the details for meeting ID 12345678.`
- `Share the recording link for yesterday's standup.`
- `Show me the transcript from the client call on Monday.`
- `Who attended the team meeting on Friday?`
- `Schedule a Zoom meeting for tomorrow at 2pm with the engineering team.`

## Zoom connection setup

View Zoom connection setup steps

The Zoom connector uses OAuth 2.0 authentication.

Complete the following steps to connect to Zoom in Workato with OAuth 2.0 authentication:

- [Add an API user](#add-an-api-user)

> **RECOMMENDED SETUP**
> 
> We recommend that you set up a dedicated API user account in Zoom or create a custom OAuth profile to authorize Workato. This allows you to assign the API user to a role with only the necessary permissions.
> 
> Alternatively, you can use an existing Zoom owner or admin account if it has the required permissions. Some admin accounts may have restricted access based on their configuration.

## How to use Zoom Meetings MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools:

### search\_meetings tool

The **search\_meetings** tool searches for Zoom meetings you have hosted or attended with optional filters for participant email, date range, and topic keywords. Your LLM uses this tool to find a past meeting even when you don't have the meeting ID. Results are limited to 50 meetings. Use date range filters to narrow results if needed.

**Try asking**:

- `Find my meetings with Josh from last week.`
- `Search for meetings about the product launch.`
- `Show me all meetings from December.`
- `Find the client call we had on Monday.`

### get\_meeting\_details tool

The **get\_meeting\_details** tool retrieves detailed information about a specific Zoom meeting including topic, scheduled time, duration, host, participant list, join URL, and passcode. Your LLM uses this tool to provide full details about a meeting, either using a known meeting ID or through a general search.

**Try asking**:

- `Get the details for meeting ID 12345678.`
- `Show me the full information for yesterday's standup.`
- `What's the join URL for the team meeting?`
- `Get the passcode for this meeting.`

### get\_meeting\_recording tool

The **get\_meeting\_recording** tool retrieves cloud recording links for a Zoom meeting including video, audio, and chat files if available. Your LLM uses this tool to access or share a meeting recording. Recording links are subject to Zoom access controls and retention policies. Recipients may need Zoom authentication or a passcode to access recordings.

**Try asking**:

- `Get the recording link for yesterday's standup.`
- `Share the recording from the client call on Monday.`
- `Is the recording available for meeting ID 12345678?`
- `Get all recording files from the product demo.`

### get\_meeting\_transcript tool

The **get\_meeting\_transcript** tool retrieves the auto-generated transcript for a Zoom meeting with speaker labels and timestamps if available. Your LLM uses this tool to provide a meeting summary, action items, or to search for what was said. Transcript availability depends on the host's Zoom settings. Large transcripts may truncate due to response size limits.

**Try asking**:

- `Show me the transcript from the client call on Monday.`
- `Get the transcript for yesterday's team meeting.`
- `What was discussed in the product review meeting?`
- `Summarize the key points from the meeting transcript.`

### get\_meeting\_participants tool

The **get\_meeting\_participants** tool retrieves the attendance list for a completed Zoom meeting, including participant names, emails (if available), join and leave times, and total duration. Your LLM uses this tool to verify who attended a meeting or check attendance patterns.

**Try asking**:

- `Who attended the team meeting on Friday?`
- `Show me the attendance list for yesterday's standup.`
- `How long did Marco stay in the client call?`
- `Get the participant list for meeting ID 12345678.`

### create\_meeting tool

The **create\_meeting** tool creates a new Zoom meeting with specified topic, start time, duration, agenda, and invitees. Your LLM uses this tool to schedule a new Zoom meeting.

**Try asking**:

- `Schedule a Zoom meeting for tomorrow at 2pm with the engineering team.`
- `Create a meeting called 'Product Demo' for next Monday at 10am.`
- `Set up a 30-minute standup for Friday morning.`
- `Schedule a client call for next Wednesday at 3pm and invite jade@acme.com.`

### update\_meeting tool

The **update\_meeting** tool updates an existing scheduled Zoom meeting including topic, start time, duration, or agenda. Your LLM uses this tool to modify an existing meeting's time, title, or description.

**Try asking**:

- `Update the product review meeting to start at 3pm instead.`
- `Change the topic of tomorrow's meeting to 'Q1 Planning'.`
- `Extend the client call duration to 90 minutes.`
- `Move Friday's standup to 10am.`

### get\_recording\_vtt tool

The **get\_recording\_vtt** tool fetches the VTT caption file content for a Zoom cloud recording. Your LLM uses this tool to read the captions of recordings. This tool requires the `download_url` returned by a prior `get_meeting_recording` call because it doesn't perform its own recording lookup.

**Try asking**:

- `Get the captions from the recording we pulled earlier.`
- `Show me the VTT file content for this recording.`
- `Fetch the caption file from yesterday's meeting recording.`
- `Read the VTT captions for the client call recording.`
