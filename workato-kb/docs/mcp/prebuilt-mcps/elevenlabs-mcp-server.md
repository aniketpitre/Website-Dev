# ElevenLabs MCP server

The ElevenLabs MCP server enables LLMs to interact with ElevenLabs for text-to-speech audio generation through natural conversation. It provides tools to list available voices, inspect voice metadata, identify supported TTS models, and generate spoken audio from text without requiring direct interaction with the ElevenLabs interface.

## Uses

Use the ElevenLabs MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Generate spoken audio from user-provided or agent-generated text
- Apply inline emotion and style tags so audio matches the tone of the source content
- Create accessibility playback for written content
- Produce product walkthrough narration
- Prototype voices and personas before committing to a final choice
- Browse the voices available to your configured account
- Inspect a specific voice's metadata and default settings
- Identify the TTS models supported by your account

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke ElevenLabs MCP server tools:

- `Show me the voices available in my account.`
- `Get the details and default settings for the Rachel voice.`
- `Which TTS models can I use for audio generation?`
- `Convert this daily brief into audio using a clear, professional voice.`
- `Generate an MP3 narration of this product walkthrough.`
- `Create an audio version of this article for accessibility playback.`
- `Use the latest multilingual model to generate this narration.`
- `Narrate this announcement with an excited tone using the expressive eleven_v3 model.`
- `Try a few different voices for this intro so I can compare personas.`

## How to use ElevenLabs MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools:

### list\_voices tool

The **list\_voices** tool lists the voices available to your configured account and returns metadata that helps select an appropriate voice. Your LLM uses this tool to find which voices it can use and to choose one that matches a user's tone, language, or persona requirements.

**Try asking**:

- `Show me the voices available in my account.`
- `Which voices can I use for a narration?`
- `List the voices that work well for a calm, professional tone.`

### get\_voice tool

The **get\_voice** tool retrieves detailed metadata and default settings for a specific voice. Your LLM uses this tool to understand how a voice should be used and to confirm its default configuration.

**Try asking**:

- `Get the details for the Rachel voice.`
- `What are the default settings for this voice?`
- `Show me the configuration for the voice I selected.`

### list\_models tool

The **list\_models** tool lists the TTS models available to your configured account. Your LLM uses this tool to identify which models it can choose from.

**Try asking**:

- `Which TTS models can I use?`
- `List the available text-to-speech models.`
- `What model should I use for multilingual narration?`

### generate\_audio tool

The **generate\_audio** tool generates spoken audio from text using a selected voice, model, output format, and optional voice settings. Your LLM uses this tool to convert user-provided or agent-generated text into an audio file. The audio returns as an MP3 by default. You can use inline emotion and style tags, such as `[excited]` or `[whispering]`, for expressive output when you use a compatible model like `eleven_v3`.

**Try asking**:

- `Convert this daily brief into audio using a professional voice.`
- `Generate an MP3 narration of this script.`
- `Read this story aloud with [whispering] and [excited] emotion tags using the eleven_v3 model.`
- `Read this article aloud for accessibility playback.`
