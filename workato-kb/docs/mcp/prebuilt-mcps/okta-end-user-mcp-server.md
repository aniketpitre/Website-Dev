> Use the Okta End User MCP server to connect your LLM to Okta with a curated set of tools to retrieve your identity, access, and authentication information.

# Okta End User MCP server

The Okta End User MCP server enables LLMs to understand and retrieve your identity, access, and authentication information in Okta through natural conversation. The Okta End User MCP server helps you understand your identity profile, discover which applications you have access to, and quickly launch applications with SSO links directly from your AI conversation.

## Uses

Use the Okta End User MCP server when you plan to perform the following actions:

- View your own Okta profile information including role, department, and manager
- Discover which applications you currently have access to
- Get direct SSO links to launch applications without navigating Okta
- Understand your organizational context and reporting relationships
- Check your profile attributes and identity information

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Okta End User MCP server tools:

- `What's my job title and department in Okta?`
- `Who is my manager?`
- `What applications do I have access to?`
- `Show me my Okta profile information.`
- `Get me the SSO link to launch Salesforce.`
- `What apps can I access?`

## Okta End User MCP server tools

The Okta End User MCP server provides the following tools:

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [get\_my\_user\_profile](#get-my-user-profile-tool) | Retrieves profile and organizational information for the authenticated user. |
| [list\_assigned\_applications](#list-assigned-applications-tool) | Retrieves the set of applications currently assigned to the authenticated user. |
| [get\_application\_sso\_link](#get-application-sso-link-tool) | Retrieves the single sign-on (SSO) link for an application assigned to the authenticated user. |

## Install the Okta End User MCP server

Complete the following steps to install a prebuilt MCP server to your project:

1. Sign in to your Workato account.
   
2. Go to **AI Hub > Enterprise MCP > Custom servers**.
   
3. Click **\+ Create MCP server**.
   
4. Go to the **Start with pre-built MCP Servers using your connected apps** section and select the prebuilt MCP server you plan to use.
   
5. Click **Use this server**.
   
6. Provide a name for your MCP server in the **Server name** field.
   
7. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project for the MCP server.
   
8. Go to the **Connections** section and connect to your app account.
   
9. Select the connection type you plan to use for the MCP server template.
   
   - **User's connection**: MCP server tools perform actions based on the identity and permissions of the user who connects to the application. Users authenticate with their own credentials to execute the skill.
   - **Your connection**: This option uses the connection established by the recipe builder and follows the same principles as normal app connections.

## Okta connection setup

View Okta connection setup steps

Okta supports the following authentication types:

- [Authorization code grant authentication (OAuth 2.0)](#authorization-code-grant-authentication)
- [Client credentials-based authentication (OAuth 2.0)](#client-credentials-based-authentication)
- [API key-based authentication](#api-key-based-authentication)

Workato recommends using either authorization code grant authentication (OAuth 2.0) or client credentials-based authentication (OAuth 2.0) for improved security in your connection. These methods also let you define granular permissions that control which resources Workato can access in Okta.

> **VIRTUAL PRIVATE WORKATO (VPW) CUSTOMERS**
> 
> This feature requires configuration steps that are specific to your Virtual Private Workato (VPW) instance. If you are a VPW customer, refer to your VPW private documentation for the configuration details for your instances.

### Authorization code grant authentication

Authorization code grant authentication requires creating an app integration and secret in Okta.

View API key connection setup steps

#### Generate an API key

  

> **API KEY PRIVILEGES AND LIMITATIONS**
> 
> You must have administrator privileges in Okta to create an API key. Ensure that you're logged in as an administrator before you proceed.
> 
> Workato requires that the user and API key used in the connection have **Organization Administrator** or **Super Administrator** permissions. API keys inherit all permissions from the administrator who created them and can't be restricted to specific resources or operations. We recommend that you use a scoped OAuth 2.0 access token for improved security.
> 
> Refer to [Create an API token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/create-the-token/) for more information.

Complete the following steps to generate an API key in Okta:

1. Sign in to Okta.
   
2. Go to **Security > API > Token**.
   
3. Click **Create token** to generate an API key. The key inherits the permissions of the administrator who created it.

## How to use Okta End User MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools:

### get\_my\_user\_profile tool

The **get\_my\_user\_profile** tool retrieves your profile and organizational information. Your LLM uses this tool to provide detailed identity context, including your role, department, title, manager, and other profile attributes.

**Try asking**:

- `What's my official job title and department?`
- `Show me my Okta profile information.`
- `Who is my manager in Okta?`
- `What's my role and organizational information?`

### list\_assigned\_applications tool

**Try asking**:

- `What applications do I have access to in Okta?`
- `Show me all my assigned apps.`
- `List the applications I can use.`
- `What tools and services can I access through Okta?`

### get\_application\_sso\_link tool

The **get\_application\_sso\_link** tool retrieves the single sign-on (SSO) link for an application assigned to the authenticated user. Your LLM uses this tool to launch specific apps without navigating to the Okta UI.
