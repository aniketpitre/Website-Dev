> Use the Marketing Event Program Orchestration MCP server to connect your LLM to Marketo, Google Calendar, Slack, and ZoomInfo with governed event program creation, calendar scheduling, and registrant list imports that commit only after you approve a real preview.

# Marketing Event Program Orchestration MCP server

The Marketing Event Program Orchestration MCP server enables LLMs to interact with Marketo, Google Calendar, Slack, and ZoomInfo for managing event programs and registrant lists through natural conversation. It provides tools to resolve an event's type and region to the correct template, folder, and channel, create or clone a program, book a calendar hold, look up existing programs, and validate and import a lead list.

## Uses

Use the Marketing Event Program Orchestration MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Create a new Marketo event program from a pre-configured template, folder, and channel
- Book a calendar hold on Google Calendar or Outlook for a newly created event program
- Look up an existing Marketo event program by name or ID before importing members into it
- Import a registrant or lead list into an existing Marketo event program
- Review row counts and a create-versus-update breakdown before an import commits
- Approve a preview before creating a program or importing members
- Fill blank lead fields with ZoomInfo firmographic data during import
- Check the status of an in-progress program creation or lead import
- Recover an interrupted import or program creation session without repeating earlier steps
- Receive a Slack notification for newly created programs and completed imports

Additionally, use the server's built-in [Event360 MCP app](#event360-mcp-app) to fill in an event's details or review a lead file's column mapping before either one commits.

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Marketing Event Program Orchestration MCP server tools:

- `Set up a new webinar program for APJ next month.`
- `Get this registrant CSV into the Q2 webinar program.`
- `Did my lead import finish?`
- `What's the URL for the trade show program I created last week?`
- `I navigated away. What was I uploading?`
- `Create a field event in NORAM and book the calendar for it.`
- `Open Event Ops.`
- `Set up a new live event for Japan on March 3rd.`
- `Show me my recent event and import operations.`
- `Import these leads into the program I just created.`

## Marketing Event Program Orchestration connection setup

View Marketing Event Program Orchestration connection setup steps

Configure the following connections to set up the Marketing Event Program Orchestration MCP server:

- [Marketo](#marketo-connection): Required.
- [Google Calendar](#google-calendar-connection): Required.
- [Slack](#slack-connection): Optional. Connect to Slack to receive a notification when a new program is created or a lead import finishes.
- [ZoomInfo](#zoominfo-connection): Optional. Connect to ZoomInfo to automatically fill blank lead fields during import.

### Role requirements

Each tool's availability depends on the permissions granted to connected accounts. Missing scopes for these connections block the corresponding tool with a `permission_denied` outcome rather than a partial result. Required connections must have the following access:

- Marketo: Requires read and write access to `Lead`, `Asset`, and `Activity`
- Google Calendar: Requires access to create events on the target calendar

Missing scopes on the optional Slack and ZoomInfo connections result in non-blocking outcomes: Slack notifications report as `partial_success`, and the server silently skips lead enrichment for the affected rows.

### Marketo connection

View Marketo connection setup steps

The Marketo connector uses custom authentication.

> **CUSTOM SERVICE CLIENTS**
> 
> Marketo exposes REST endpoints to enable integration platforms like Workato to remotely access and execute core functionalities. We recommend you create a custom service client specifically for Workato to facilitate this integration.
> 
> Key benefits of using a custom service client include:
> 
> - **Isolated logging**: All operations are logged under a dedicated custom service client for integration and workflow processes. This approach enhances tracking and troubleshooting by isolating issues related to specific integration platforms.
> - **Customized permissions**: A custom service client allows for tailored permissions and security profiles, independent of individual employee user accounts.
> 
> Ensure that the custom service client is granted all necessary permissions to perform the required actions for your integration scenario. If a `403` error occurs during recipe execution, it indicates that the service client lacks the appropriate permissions for the action.

#### Service account authentication

View Service account authentication steps

A Google service account is a specialized Google account associated with a Google Cloud Project (GCP) that can run API requests on your behalf.

Service accounts provide the following benefits:

- **Continuous operation:** Service accounts ensure that operations continue even if individual user permissions change.
- **Dedicated permissions:** Service accounts can only access projects that you share with them.
- **Dedicated API quotas:** You can manage a service account's API quotas through GCP and request quota increases directly from Google.

Refer to the [Google service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) to learn more about service accounts.

Service account authentication consists of the following actions:

- [Set up a Google service account](#set-up-a-google-service-account)
- [Enable the Google Calendar API](#api-setup)
- [Complete setup in Workato](#setup)

##### Minimum scopes for service account connections

The following scopes are required to connect to Google Calendar using a service account:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.resource.calendar`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`

A `401 Unauthorized error` may occur when the service account uses the `Owner` role or lacks required scopes. Assign the `Editor` role to the service account in the Google Cloud Console and confirm it includes all required scopes listed above. This ensures the service account can authenticate and access Google Calendar successfully.

Refer to the [Google Calendar API scopes](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/auth) documentation for a complete list of supported scopes.

##### Set up a Google service account

View Set up a Google service account steps

## How to use Marketing Event Program Orchestration MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools:

### open\_event\_intake tool

The **open\_event\_intake** tool opens the [Event360 companion app](#event360-mcp-app) to create an event program or import a lead list. Your LLM uses this tool to set up a new event program or import a registrant list into Marketo.

**Try asking**:

- `Set up a new webinar program.`
- `I have an event to add.`
- `Open Event Ops.`
- `Get this list into Marketo.`

### provision\_event\_program tool

The **provision\_event\_program** tool looks up the details for a Marketo event, presents a preview for your approval, then creates the program and books a calendar hold. Your LLM calls this tool once to retrieve information and display a preview, then calls it again after receiving approval to create the program and book the hold.

**Try asking**:

- `Set up a new webinar program for APJ next month.`
- `Create a field event in NORAM and book the calendar for it.`
- `Set up a new live event for Japan on March 3rd.`
- `Approve this event program preview.`

### get\_lead\_field\_map tool

The **get\_lead\_field\_map** tool returns the configured Marketo lead field catalog from the `marketo_lead_field_map` data table, such as the API name, label, aliases, whether the field is required, and sort order. The [Event360 companion app](#event360-mcp-app) uses this tool to create the CSV column mapping for a lead import.

**Try asking**:

- `What lead fields does this deployment support for import?`
- `Show me the required fields for a lead import.`
- `Which column maps to the Company field in Marketo?`

### search\_event\_programs tool

The **search\_event\_programs** tool finds existing Marketo event programs by name prefix on the recent-program list, or by numeric ID through a live Marketo lookup. Your LLM uses this tool to resolve a program by name or ID before importing members into it, or to answer questions about a program you've recently created.

**Try asking**:

- `What's the URL for the trade show program I created last week?`
- `Find the Q2 webinar program.`
- `Search for the NORAM field event program.`
- `Look up program 123074.`

### import\_program\_members tool

The **import\_program\_members** tool receives a lead CSV from the [Event360 app](#event360-mcp-app), checks the file's row counts and validity, presents the results for your approval, then imports into Marketo.

**Try asking**:

- `Get this registrant CSV into the Q2 webinar program.`
- `Import these leads into the program I just created.`
- `Here's the mapping for my registrant file.`
- `Commit this lead import.`

### get\_operation\_status tool

The **get\_operation\_status** tool lists recent operations, or polls a specific operation's status when you provide an ID. You can explicitly ask for the live result or allow the tool to poll Marketo and update cached statuses automatically. Your LLM uses this tool to check progress on a program creation or lead import, or to recover an in-progress operation after you reconnect.

**Try asking**:

- `Did my lead import finish?`
- `What's the URL for the trade show program I created last week?`
- `I navigated away. What was I uploading?`
- `Check the real current status of my import, not the cached one.`

## Event360 MCP app

The [open\_event\_intake](#open-event-intake-tool) tool opens the Event360 [MCP app](/en/mcp/mcp-apps), which manages event program creation and lead list uploads. Both workflows present a preview for your approval before writing. The app also monitors the status of in-progress operations to help you resume work after you reconnect.
