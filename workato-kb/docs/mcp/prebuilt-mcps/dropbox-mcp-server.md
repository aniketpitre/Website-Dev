# Dropbox MCP server

The Dropbox MCP server enables LLMs to interact with files and folders stored in Dropbox through natural conversation. It provides tools to search files, browse folder contents, retrieve file metadata, access file content, organize files, and share files through links without requiring direct interaction with the Dropbox interface.

## Uses

Use the Dropbox MCP server to perform the following actions:

- List files and subfolders within a specified Dropbox folder
- Search for files using keywords and filters
- Retrieve metadata for a specific file or folder
- Access a file's content
- Move or rename a file or folder
- Create a duplicate of a file
- Create a new folder
- Delete a file or folder
- Create or retrieve a shared link for a file or folder
- List existing shared links for a file or across the account
- Revoke a shared link to remove access

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Dropbox MCP server tools:

- `What's inside my Projects folder?`
- `Find files related to the Q2 budget.`
- `Get the metadata for this file before I move it.`
- `Open this document so I can review it.`
- `Move this file to the Archive folder.`
- `Rename this folder to match the new project name.`
- `Make a copy of this file before I start editing.`
- `Create a new folder called Client Deliverables.`
- `Delete this old draft.`
- `Share a link to this file with the client.`
- `Is this file already shared?`
- `Revoke the shared link for this document.`
