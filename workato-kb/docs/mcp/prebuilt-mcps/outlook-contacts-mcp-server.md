- Update specific fields on an existing contact
- Permanently delete a contact
- Move a contact from one folder to another
- List contact folders and check folder contents

## How to use Outlook Contacts MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools:

### search\_contacts tool

The **search\_contacts** tool searches personal contacts by name or email address. Your LLM uses this tool to find contacts or retrieve details for downstream actions, such as sending an email or scheduling a meeting. **Try asking**:

- `Find Sarah's contact details.`
- `Search for marco@acme.com.`
- `Look up the contact for this person before I email them.`
- `Find the contact I need to schedule a meeting with.`

### list\_contacts tool

The **list\_contacts** tool lists contacts from a contact folder with optional filtering. Your LLM uses this tool to browse contacts, list everyone in a specific folder, or filter by company, folder, or category without a specific name search.

**Try asking**:

- `Show all my contacts.`
- `List everyone in my Vendors folder.`
- `Show contacts tagged VIP.`
- `List all contacts at Acme.`

### get\_contact tool

The **get\_contact** tool retrieves full details for a contact by ID. Your LLM uses this tool after **search\_contacts** or **list\_contacts** to retrieve information for a selected result, and before performing write operations such as **update\_contact** or **delete\_contact** to confirm current state and read array field values.

**Try asking**:

- `Get the full profile for this contact.`
- `Show me all details for this person before I update their record.`
- `Retrieve the complete contact information for this result.`
- `Get this contact's details before I delete them.`

### create\_contact tool

The **create\_contact** tool creates a new contact in the user's Outlook contacts. Your LLM asks for at least one identifying field, such as display name, first name, last name, or email address, before creating the record.

**Try asking**:

- `Save Marcus as a new contact.`
- `Add this person to my Outlook contacts.`
- `Create a contact for the new account manager I met today.`
- `Save this lead's details as a contact.`

### update\_contact tool

The **update\_contact** tool updates fields you specify on an existing contact. Your LLM uses this tool to change contact details, such as phone numbers, email addresses, job titles, or category tags.

**Try asking**:

- `Update the phone number for this contact.`
- `Change Sarah's job title to VP of Marketing.`
- `Add the VIP category tag to this contact.`
- `Update Marco's email address.`

### delete\_contact tool

The **delete\_contact** tool permanently deletes a contact from the user's Outlook contacts. Your LLM uses this tool only when you explicitly request deletion. Your LLM retrieves and presents the contact to you before deleting. Deletion is permanent.

**Try asking**:

- `Delete this contact from my Outlook.`
- `Remove this person from my contacts.`
- `Permanently delete this contact record.`
- `Clean up this duplicate contact.`

### move\_contact tool

The **move\_contact** tool moves a contact from one contact folder to another. Your LLM identifies both the contact and the destination folder before moving.

**Try asking**:

- `Move this contact to the Partners folder.`
- `Reorganize Sarah into the Vendors folder.`
- `Transfer this contact from Prospects to Customers.`
- `Move Mei into my VIP folder.`

### list\_contact\_folders tool

The **list\_contact\_folders** tool lists the user's contact folders. Your LLM uses this tool when you ask what folders you have, or when a folder ID is needed before creating, moving, or managing contacts. Your LLM also uses this tool before creating a new folder to check for duplicate names, and before deleting a folder to retrieve the contact count.

**Try asking**:

- `What contact folders do I have?`
- `Show me all my Outlook contact folders.`
- `List my folders before I create a new one.`
- `What folders can I move this contact into?`

### get\_contact\_folder tool

The **get\_contact\_folder** tool retrieves details for a contact folder you specify, including child folders. Your LLM uses this tool when a folder ID is available and folder details or structure are needed, and before deleting a folder to retrieve the contact count.

**Try asking**:

- `Get details for the Vendors folder.`
- `Show me the subfolders inside this folder.`
- `How many contacts are in this folder before I delete it?`
- `Get the full details of this contact folder.`

### create\_contact\_folder tool

The **create\_contact\_folder** tool creates a new contact folder, with the option to create it as a subfolder. Your LLM checks existing folders through **list\_contact\_folders** before creating. Your LLM informs you if a folder with the same name already exists and asks for confirmation before proceeding.

**Try asking**:

- `Create a new folder called Prospects.`
- `Add a subfolder called Enterprise inside my Customers folder.`
- `Set up a new contact folder for this project.`
- `Create a VIP folder for my top accounts.`

### update\_contact\_folder tool

The **update\_contact\_folder** tool renames an existing contact folder. Your LLM confirms the correct folder through **list\_contact\_folders** or **get\_contact\_folder** before renaming.

**Try asking**:

- `Rename the Prospects folder to Pipeline.`
- `Change this folder's name to Active Customers.`
- `Rename my VIP folder to Priority Accounts.`
- `Update the name of this contact folder.`

### delete\_contact\_folder tool

The **delete\_contact\_folder** tool deletes a contact folder and all contacts within it. Your LLM uses this tool only when you explicitly request deletion.

**Try asking**:

- `Delete the old Prospects folder.`
- `Remove this contact folder and its contents.`
- `Clean up this unused folder.`
- `Delete the archived contacts folder.`

### list\_categories tool

The **list\_categories** tool lists all Outlook category labels currently in use across the user's contacts. Your LLM uses this tool before applying a category to a contact to surface existing labels and validate spelling before using **update\_contact** or **create\_contact**.

**Try asking**:

- `What categories have I applied to my contacts?`
- `Show me all my contact tags.`
- `What labels are available before I tag this contact?`
- `List my existing Outlook categories.`
