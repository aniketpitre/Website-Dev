# OneDrive MCP server

The OneDrive MCP server enables LLMs to work with files and folders stored in Microsoft OneDrive for Business through natural conversation. It provides tools to discover files, retrieve metadata and content, organize folders, manage sharing and access, and handle the lifecycle of OneDrive artifacts without requiring direct interaction with the OneDrive interface.

> **NOT COMPATIBLE WITH POWERPOINT OR WORD**
> 
> The OneDrive MCP server doesn't support actions for Microsoft PowerPoint or Microsoft Word.

## Uses

Use the OneDrive MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Search for files and folders using name keywords, file type, owner, or time filters
- List contents of specific folders with pagination support
- Get metadata and permission information for files and folders
- Retrieve readable text content from files
- Create new folders and organize folder structures
- Copy files to create duplicates or templates
- Upload and save files to OneDrive
- Move files and folders to different locations
- Rename files and folders
- Delete files and folders
- Review sharing and access permissions
- Share files and folders with specific users or groups
- Modify or remove existing permissions

### Example prompts

You can use the following prompts to invoke OneDrive MCP server tools:

- `Find all PowerPoint presentations modified in the last week.`
- `List what's in my Project Alpha folder.`
- `Get the metadata for this quarterly report file.`
- `Read the contents of the meeting notes document.`
