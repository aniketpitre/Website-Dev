Each tool's availability depends on the access scope and entitlement tier of your connected Clay account.

The Clay Contact & Company Explorer MCP server doesn't perform additional user-level permission checks beyond what the Clay API enforces. Refer to Clay's [Roles and permissions](https://university.clay.com/docs/roles-and-permissions) guide for the complete list of role capabilities.
