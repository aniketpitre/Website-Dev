# Google Calendar MCP server

The Google Calendar MCP server enables LLMs to reliably read, interpret, and modify data stored in Google Calendar. It provides tools to retrieve events, check availability, and create, update, or delete calendar entries. The Google Calendar MCP server respects permission interfaces for Google Calendar sharing and privacy boundaries.

The Google Calendar MCP server supports a wide range of assistant-driven workflows including daily and weekly planning, meeting scheduling, rescheduling, time-off planning, reporting, and workload evaluation by exposing structured event and availability data.

## Uses

Use the Google Calendar MCP server when you plan to perform the following actions:

- View upcoming or past calendar events for planning or reporting
- Check availability for yourself or other attendees to support scheduling
- Schedule new meetings, focus time, or out-of-office events
- Reschedule, update, or cancel existing calendar events

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Google Calendar MCP server tools:

- `Schedule 30 minutes with Alex and Priya next week.`
- `I’m sick today—move my meetings.`
- `When is a good time for me to take a few days off?`

### Service account authentication

View Service account authentication steps

A Google service account is a specialized Google account associated with a Google Cloud Project (GCP) that can run API requests on your behalf.

Service accounts provide the following benefits:

- **Continuous operation:** Service accounts ensure that operations continue even if individual user permissions change.
- **Dedicated permissions:** Service accounts can only access projects that you share with them.
- **Dedicated API quotas:** You can manage a service account's API quotas through GCP and request quota increases directly from Google.

Refer to the [Google service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) to learn more about service accounts.

Service account authentication consists of the following actions:

- [Set up a Google service account](#set-up-a-google-service-account)
- [Enable the Google Calendar API](#api-setup)
- [Complete setup in Workato](#setup)

#### Minimum scopes for service account connections

The following scopes are required to connect to Google Calendar using a service account:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.resource.calendar`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`

A `401 Unauthorized error` may occur when the service account uses the `Owner` role or lacks required scopes. Assign the `Editor` role to the service account in the Google Cloud Console and confirm it includes all required scopes listed above. This ensures the service account can authenticate and access Google Calendar successfully.

Refer to the [Google Calendar API scopes](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/auth) documentation for a complete list of supported scopes.

#### Set up a Google service account

View Set up a Google service account steps

Complete the following steps to set up a Google service account:

1. [Create a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating) in your GCP project.
   
2. Go to **IAM & Admin > Service accounts**. Ensure your dashboard is scoped to the project that contains your service account. ![Check the scope of your dashboard.](/assets/service-project-scope.8Rf50DK2.png)_Check the scope of your dashboard._
   
3. Click the **Email** of the service account you intend to use. ![Click the email of the service account you intend to use.](/assets/service-email-button.C9qaZFkJ.png)_Click the **Email** of the service account you intend to use._
   
4. Copy the service account's **Email** and save it to configure your connection later. ![Copy the account's email](/assets/service-account-email.DM6BBBhN.png)_Copy the account's **Email**._
   
5. Go to the **KEYS** tab.
   
6. [Generate a private key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating_service_account_keys) and download it in JSON format. You can only download the key once.
   
7. Open the JSON file, then copy the entire private key from `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` to `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n` (inclusive) and save it to configure your connection later.
   

#### Enable the Google Calendar API

View Enable the Google Calendar API steps

You must enable the Google Calendar API before you return to Workato to finish setting up your connection.

1. Sign in to Google's [API library](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library).
   
2. Search for and select the `Google Calendar API`.
   
3. Click **Enable** to enable the API. ![Enable the Google Calendar API](/assets/google-calendar-api.DMWBkrRb.png)_**Enable** the `Google Calendar API`_
   

#### Complete setup in Workato

View Workato setup steps

Complete the following steps in Workato to set up your Google Calendar connection using a service account:

1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for and select `Google Calendar` as your connection on the **New connection** page.
