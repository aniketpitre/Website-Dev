# Docusign MCP server

The Docusign MCP server enables LLMs to manage the lifecycle of agreements sent for electronic signature within Docusign through natural conversation. It provides tools to create agreements from templates, send agreements for signature, track the progress of agreement documentation, and retrieve completed documents without requiring direct interaction with the Docusign interface.

## Uses

Use the Docusign MCP server to perform the following actions:

- List and search envelopes filtered by status, date range, sender, or recipient
- Retrieve summary details and status for a specific envelope
- Check recipient-level signing status to identify who has signed or is pending
- List documents attached to an envelope
- List available templates and retrieve template structure and required fields
- Create a draft envelope from a template
- Send a draft envelope to recipients for signature
- Cancel an in-progress envelope
- Resend signing notifications to remind recipients

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Docusign MCP server tools:

- `Show me all agreements awaiting signature.`
- `List envelopes sent to this recipient in the last 30 days.`
- `Get the status of this agreement.`
- `Who still needs to sign this envelope?`
- `List the documents attached to this envelope.`
- `What templates are available for sending agreements?`
- `Show me the required fields for this template.`
- `Create a draft agreement from the NDA template.`
- `Send this draft envelope to the recipients.`
- `Cancel this in-progress agreement.`
- `Remind the recipients who haven't signed yet.`

## Docusign connection setup

View Docusign connection setup steps

The Docusign connector supports the following authentication types:

- [JWT Grant](#jwt-token)
- [OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Grant)](#oauth-2-0)

> **AUTHENTICATION AND SENDING**
> 
> **JWT Grant** authentication uses the Docusign `impersonation` scope to send documents from the email address of the user you connect with, without requiring that user to sign in. The impersonated user, or their account admin, must grant consent before you can connect.
> 
> **OAuth 2.0** (Authorization Code Grant) sends all documents from the email address of the user who signs in to authorize the connection.

> **ROLES AND PERMISSIONS**
> 
> Users who can sign in to Docusign can connect it to Workato. Users have the same permissions and capabilities to view, manage, and send envelopes on Workato as in Docusign. Refer to the Docusign [Permission Profiles](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-admin-guide-permission-sets) documentation for more information.

The Docusign connector works with the following Docusign plans:

- Personal
- Standard
- Business Pro

View JWT Grant authentication setup steps

##### Obtain consent for user impersonation

View obtain consent for user impersonation steps

JWT Grant authentication sends envelopes from the email address of the user you connect with, using Docusign's user impersonation. Connecting as that user requires consent, which comes in two forms:

- [Admin consent](#obtain-admin-consent) for the JWT app (one-time setup for the organization)
- [Individual user consent](#obtain-individual-user-consent) for the user you connect as

###### Obtain admin consent

View obtain admin consent steps

Use the Docusign Admin panel to grant consent to your JWT app on behalf of all users within your organization's claimed domains. This authorization grants app access to all domain users, with access limited by the permissions you specify. This is a one-time configuration.

> **PREREQUISITES FOR ADMIN CONSENT**
> 
> - Your organization must have the Docusign Admin feature enabled.
> - Your organization must have at least one claimed domain. Refer to the Docusign [Claim a domain](https://support.docusign.com/s/document-item?bundleId=rrf1583359212854&topicId=gso1583359141256_1.html) documentation.
> - You must have created an [integration key](#create-an-integration-key) for your app.

Complete the following steps to obtain admin consent:

1. Sign in to Docusign as an organization administrator.
   
2. Open your [Organization](https://apps-d.docusign.com/admin/organization/) home page in Docusign Admin.
   
3. Select **Connected Apps** from the navigation pane.
   
4. Select **Authorize Application** and choose your application from the drop-down menu. This menu lists every integration key by name (for example, `Workato Integration`).
   
5. Enter `signature impersonation` in the **Permissions** field of the **Add New Application** dialog.
   
   These permissions apply to every user who's a member of the organization's claimed domains.
   
6. Click **Add** to confirm and authorize the application.
   

Refer to the Docusign [How to obtain admin consent for internal applications](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/consent/obtaining-admin-consent-internal/) documentation for more information.

###### Obtain individual user consent

View obtain individual user consent steps

Each user you plan to connect as must grant individual consent to your JWT app. This allows the app to act on their behalf when sending envelopes.

> **INTEGRATION KEY AND REDIRECT URI**
> 
> Ensure you complete the [integration key](#create-an-integration-key) and [redirect URI](#add-the-redirect-uri) steps from the JWT Grant setup section before you set up individual consent.

Complete the following steps to obtain individual user consent:

**For administrators**

1. Construct the individual consent URL using the following format:
   
   **For production accounts:**
   
   ```
   https://account.docusign.com/oauth/auth?response_type=code&scope=signature%20impersonation&client_id=YOUR_INTEGRATION_KEY&redirect_uri=https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback
   ```
   
   **For demo/sandbox accounts:**
   
   ```
   https://account-d.docusign.com/oauth/auth?response_type=code&scope=signature%20impersonation&client_id=YOUR_INTEGRATION_KEY&redirect_uri=https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback
   ```
   
   Replace `YOUR_INTEGRATION_KEY` with your integration key (Client ID).
   
2. Provide the consent URL to each user who needs to grant consent. Users can open this URL in their web browser.
   

**For users**

1. Open the consent URL provided by your administrator in a web browser.
   
2. Sign in to Docusign.
   
3. Review the consent screen and click **Accept** to grant consent. You won't be prompted again unless consent is revoked.
   

  

> **CONSENT DURING CONNECTION**
> 
> Docusign prompts you to grant consent when you [connect with JWT Grant authentication](#jwt-token). This grants individual consent for the user who authenticates the connection. You only need to follow the steps above to pre-authorize consent for users who won't personally set up the connection, for example, so an admin can grant consent ahead of time for another user's connection.

Refer to the Docusign [How to obtain individual consent](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/consent/obtaining-individual-consent/) documentation for more information.
