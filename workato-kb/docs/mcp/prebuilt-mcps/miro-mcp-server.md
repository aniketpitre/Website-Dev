> Use the Miro MCP server to connect your LLM to Miro boards with tools to find boards, read and capture structured content, update items, and organize content using frames and tags.

# Miro MCP server

The Miro MCP server enables LLMs to interact with Miro for reading, capturing, updating, and organizing structured board content through natural conversation. It provides tools to find boards, retrieve and create structured items, such as sticky notes, cards, and text items, manage tags, and organize content using frames without requiring direct interaction with the Miro interface.

## Uses

Use the Miro MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Find and access Miro boards by name or recency
- Read and review structured board content including sticky notes, cards, and text items
- Capture new ideas and structured work items as sticky notes, cards, or text
- Update existing board items including content, tags, and frame placement
- Organize content by assigning items to frames and applying tags
- Create new boards for upcoming workflows or collaboration sessions
- List and manage board-level tags for content categorization
- Filter board items by type or frame to explore specific sections of a board

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Miro MCP server tools:

- `Find my Q2 planning board.`
- `Show me the boards I've accessed recently.`
- `What sticky notes are on the retrospective board?`
- `Add a sticky note to the brainstorming board with the idea 'automate onboarding emails.'`
- `Create a card for the API integration task with a due date of next Friday.`
- `Update the sticky note about the budget review to include the revised numbers.`
- `Create a new board for the Q3 roadmap planning session.`
- `List all tags available on the product feedback board.`
- `Tag all items in the Action Items frame as high-priority.`
- `Move the onboarding card into the In Progress frame.`
