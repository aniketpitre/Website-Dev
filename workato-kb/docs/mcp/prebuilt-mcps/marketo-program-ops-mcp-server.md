## Install the Marketo Program Ops MCP server

Complete the following steps to install a prebuilt MCP server to your project:

1. Sign in to your Workato account.
   
2. Go to **AI Hub > Enterprise MCP > Custom servers**.
   
3. Click **\+ Create MCP server**.
   
4. Go to the **Start with pre-built MCP Servers using your connected apps** section and select the prebuilt MCP server you plan to use.
   
5. Click **Use this server**.
   
6. Provide a name for your MCP server in the **Server name** field.
   
7. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project for the MCP server.
   
8. Go to the **Connections** section and connect to your app account.
   
9. Select the connection type you plan to use for the MCP server template.
   
   - **User's connection**: MCP server tools perform actions based on the identity and permissions of the user who connects to the application. Users authenticate with their own credentials to execute the skill.
   - **Your connection**: This option uses the connection established by the recipe builder and follows the same principles as normal app connections.
   
   ![Select your connection type](/assets/connection-type.Cor-6PJN.png)_Select your connection type_
   
   > **VERIFIED USER ACCESS AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENTS**
   > 
   > Only app connections that use OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant are available for user's connection. Refer to [Verified user access](/en/mcp/verified-user-access) for more information.
   
10. Complete the app-specific connection setup steps in the following section.
    

## Marketo connection setup

View Marketo connection setup steps

The Marketo connector uses custom authentication.

> **CUSTOM SERVICE CLIENTS**
> 
> Marketo exposes REST endpoints to enable integration platforms like Workato to remotely access and execute core functionalities. We recommend you create a custom service client specifically for Workato to facilitate this integration.
> 
> Key benefits of using a custom service client include:
> 
> - **Isolated logging**: All operations are logged under a dedicated custom service client for integration and workflow processes. This approach enhances tracking and troubleshooting by isolating issues related to specific integration platforms.
> - **Customized permissions**: A custom service client allows for tailored permissions and security profiles, independent of individual employee user accounts.
> 
> Ensure that the custom service client is granted all necessary permissions to perform the required actions for your integration scenario. If a `403` error occurs during recipe execution, it indicates that the service client lacks the appropriate permissions for the action.
