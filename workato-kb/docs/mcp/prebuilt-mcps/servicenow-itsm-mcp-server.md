# ServiceNow ITSM MCP server

The ServiceNow ITSM MCP server connects LLMs to ServiceNow Incident Management through natural conversation. It provides tools to log, search, read, update, and resolve incidents and search knowledge base articles to help deflect or resolve incidents.

This server supports ServiceNow Incident Management. It doesn't support service requests and catalog orders, change and problem management, CSM cases, CMDB and asset operations, or knowledge authoring.

## Uses

Use the ServiceNow ITSM MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Log a new incident from a description, chat message, or monitoring alert.
- Search and filter incident queues by state, priority, assignment group, or keywords.
- Retrieve full details for a specific incident by number or system ID.
- Check the status of incidents a specific person reported.
- Add work notes or customer comments, update priority, or reassign incidents.
- Resolve incidents with a resolution code and notes.
- Search the knowledge base and read articles to deflect or speed up resolution.
- Look up users and assignment groups to route incidents.
- Discover the valid values for an incident field before you set it.

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke ServiceNow ITSM MCP server tools:

- `Log an incident: the VPN is down for the sales team, high urgency.`
- `What's the status of the incidents Jordan Lee reported?`
- `Show me all high-priority incidents assigned to the network team.`
- `Get the details for incident INC0010045.`
- `Add a work note to INC0010045 saying we're waiting on the vendor.`

### ServiceNow role requirements

Each tool's availability depends on the permissions granted to the connected account. Standard incident actions require the `ITIL` role or a custom role with read and write access to the incident table. Knowledge, user, and group reads require read access to their respective tables. A request made without the required permission returns a permission-denied outcome rather than a partial result. Refer to the ServiceNow [All ServiceNow roles](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/platform-administration/user-administration/roles-summary.html) guide for more information.

### Project property configuration

The ServiceNow ITSM MCP server supports the following project-level properties to control behavior and defaults:

| Project-level property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `knowledge_article_max_length` | Maximum length of the article body returned by **get\_knowledge\_article**. Articles longer than this are truncated, and the response indicates that truncation occurred. |
| `knowledge_article_format` | Content format returned by **get\_knowledge\_article**: plain text or raw HTML, based on the connection configuration. |
