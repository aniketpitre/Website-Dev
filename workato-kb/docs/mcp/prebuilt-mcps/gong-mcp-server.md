> Use the Gong MCP server to connect your LLM to Gong with a curated set of tools to retrieve and explore customer conversation history through recordings and transcripts.

# Gong MCP server

The Gong MCP server enables LLMs to retrieve and explore customer conversation history from Gong. This allows you to access call recordings, transcripts, and participant information, without signing in to the Gong interface.

The Gong MCP server provides raw conversation data from Gong and your LLM can synthesize the data into prep notes, deal summaries, commitment tracking, or relationship overviews.

## Uses

Use the Gong MCP server when you plan to perform the following actions:

- Prepare for upcoming customer meetings using recent call history
- Catch up on what has been discussed with a customer or account
- Review conversation context for pipeline or deal discussions
- Recall commitments, action items, or next steps from past calls
- Locate a specific past conversation based on customer, participant, or timeframe
- Provide managers or coverage owners with quick situational awareness

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Gong MCP server tools:

- `I have a call with Datadog tomorrow. What should I know from our recent conversations?`
- `Catch me up on what we've discussed with Stripe in the last month`
- `What did we talk about last time we met with this customer?`
- `Give me the full picture on the Figma deal—what's happened across our calls?`
- `What objections has the customer raised on this opportunity?`
- `Who from their side has been involved in our conversations?`
- `Walk me through the conversation history for this deal`
- `What did I promise to send Acme after our call last week?`
- `What were the next steps from my call with the procurement team?`
- `Did the customer say they'd get back to us on anything?`
- `What action items came out of yesterday's call with Notion?`
- `What have been the main themes in our discussions with this customer over the past 3 months?`
