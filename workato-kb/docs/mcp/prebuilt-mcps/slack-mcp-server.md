# Slack MCP server

The Slack MCP server enables LLMs to interact with your Slack workspace for exploring conversational content, posting messages, and discovering channels and users. It provides tools to search messages and channels, retrieve channel history and thread context, send and schedule messages, explore available communication spaces, and retrieve user profile information without switching to the Slack interface.

The Slack MCP server helps you streamline communication workflows by allowing you to find past discussions, catch up on channels, post and schedule announcements, and find the right channels or people to contact directly from your AI conversation.

## Uses

Use the Slack MCP server when you plan to perform the following actions:

- Search for discussions about a topic, project, customer, or issue across channels
- Find a channel by name or topic
- Retrieve recent messages from a channel to catch up on activity
- Get the full context of a thread conversation
- Post meeting summaries, standup updates, or announcements to channels
- Schedule a message for future delivery to a channel or direct message
- Send direct messages to team members
- Discover available public channels in your workspace
- Find private channels you're already a member of
- Get information about specific channels (purpose, member count, etc.)
- Look up user profile information including title, department, and timezone

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Slack MCP server tools:

- `What's been discussed about Customer Acme in the last two weeks?`
- `Is there a channel for the checkout redesign project?`
- `Catch me up on #engineering since Monday.`
- `Get the full thread for the deployment incident discussion.`
- `Post a summary of our standup to #engineering-updates.`
- `Schedule a reminder in #team-updates for Monday at 9 AM.`
- `Send a DM to Sarah letting her know the project plan is approved.`
- `What public channels are available for engineering discussions?`
- `Get details about the #product-team channel.`
- `What is Sarah's job title and department?`

5. Optional. Expand **Advanced** and use the **Is this a Classic Slack app?** drop-down menu to select `Yes` or `No`. Select `Yes` only if you haven't migrated your Slack app to granular permission scopes. Refer to [Moving to granular permission scopes](/en/connectors/slack#moving-to-granular-permission-scopes) for more information.

8. Click **Connect**.
   
9. Click **Allow** to grant Workato permission to access your account.
   

### Slack permissions

Each tool operates within the authenticated user's Slack permission scope. The connected account must have access to the channels and conversations it searches or posts to, and it must be granted the OAuth scopes appropriate to the tools it runs. Refer to Slack's [OAuth scopes documentation](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/scopes) for the complete list of scope capabilities.
