# SurveyMonkey Authoring MCP server

The SurveyMonkey Authoring MCP server enables LLMs to interact with SurveyMonkey to build and maintain survey content through natural conversation. It provides tools to create surveys, read their structure, update survey-level settings, add and edit pages and questions, and discover templates without requiring direct interaction with the SurveyMonkey interface.

> **SERVER SCOPE**
> 
> The SurveyMonkey Authoring MCP server interacts with survey content. Use the [SurveyMonkey Distribution](/en/mcp/prebuilt-mcps/surveymonkey-distribution-mcp-server) MCP server to distribute surveys, send invitations, manage contacts, and read responses.

### SurveyMonkey Authoring role requirements

Each tool's availability depends on the plan and the OAuth scopes granted to the connected SurveyMonkey account. A request made without the required scope returns a permission-denied outcome rather than a partial result. Refer to SurveyMonkey's [OAuth scopes](https://developer.surveymonkey.com/api/v3/#scopes) documentation for the complete list of scopes and their capabilities.

## How to use SurveyMonkey Authoring MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools:

### list\_surveys tool

The **list\_surveys** tool lists surveys in the account, optionally filtered by title or sorted. Your LLM uses this tool to find a survey you plan to edit, copy, or inspect, narrowing a large account by a title fragment and ordering results by title or most-recently-modified date. This is a filter-and-sort list rather than a relevance-ranked search, so it presents results as a filtered list and offers to page through additional matches.

**Try asking**:

- `List my surveys sorted by most recently modified.`
- `Find surveys with "customer" in the title.`
- `Show me the surveys I can edit.`

### create\_survey tool

The **create\_survey** tool creates a blank survey, loads a SurveyMonkey template, or copies an existing survey. Your LLM uses this tool to start a new survey after you specify to create a blank survey or provide a source title, template ID, or survey ID. Blank surveys and copies of empty surveys still need at least one page and question before they can collect responses.

**Try asking**:

- `Create a blank survey called "Q3 Feedback".`
- `Start a new survey from the customer-satisfaction template.`
- `Copy my last event survey into a new one.`

### get\_survey\_details tool

The **get\_survey\_details** tool retrieves a survey's full structure, including its pages and questions. Your LLM uses this tool to read a survey's pages, questions, choices, and positions before editing so that changes target the correct page and question IDs.

**Try asking**:

- `What questions are on this survey?`
- `Show me the full structure of my onboarding survey.`
- `List the pages and questions before I make edits.`

### update\_survey tool

The **update\_survey** tool updates survey-level settings, such as title and navigation button text. Your LLM uses this tool to change a survey's title or navigation button labels after confirming which settings to change. This tool can't remove SurveyMonkey branding or the survey footer, which requires a paid plan.

**Try asking**:

- `Rename this survey to "Annual Employee Survey".`
- `Update the "Next" button label to "Continue".`
- `Change the "Done" button text on my survey.`

### add\_page tool

The **add\_page** tool adds a page to a survey. Your LLM uses this tool to organize questions across pages or create a page to hold new questions, placing it at a position you specify or appending it at the end after confirming the page title and location. Use the **add\_question** tool to add questions to the page.

**Try asking**:

- `Add a new page for demographic questions.`
- `Create a second page titled "Feedback".`
- `Add a page at the start of my survey.`

### update\_page tool

The **update\_page** tool updates a page's title, description, or position. Your LLM uses this tool to rename a page, revise its description, or reorder it within the survey after confirming exactly what changes. It doesn't add or remove questions.

**Try asking**:

- `Rename page 2 to "Contact Details".`
- `Move the demographics page to the end.`
- `Update the description on my intro page.`

### add\_question tool

The **add\_question** tool adds a question to a page on a survey. Your LLM uses this tool to add a fully specified question, its family, choices, and text, or to reuse a question from the SurveyMonkey question bank. Questions are placed at a position you choose or appended at the end. The add is rejected if the survey has reached the platform's survey-size limit.

**Try asking**:

- `Add a rating question to page 2.`
- `Add a multiple-choice question with these options.`
- `Add the standard NPS question from the question bank.`

### update\_question tool

The **update\_question** tool updates an existing question's text, choices, or position. Your LLM uses this tool to revise a question's wording, change its answer choices, or reorder it on its page after confirming exactly what changes. It can't move a question to another page or change its question type.

**Try asking**:

- `Change this question's wording to be more specific.`
- `Update the answer choices on my rating question.`
- `Move this question to the top of the page.`

### list\_question\_bank\_questions tool

The **list\_question\_bank\_questions** tool lists SurveyMonkey question-bank questions available to reuse. Your LLM uses this tool to find a reusable bank question and obtain its ID, which it then passes to the **add\_question** tool to place the question on a page. This tool is read-only and can be filtered by search text, locale, or custom questions.

**Try asking**:

- `Find a reusable NPS question in the question bank.`
- `Search the question bank for satisfaction questions.`
- `Show me question-bank questions I can add to this page.`

### list\_survey\_templates tool

The **list\_survey\_templates** tool lists available SurveyMonkey library templates. Your LLM uses this tool to find a SurveyMonkey template to base a new survey on and obtain its template ID for the **create\_survey** tool, optionally filtering by category or language. Only SurveyMonkey's library templates are available. Team and custom templates aren't listed.

**Try asking**:

- `Show me SurveyMonkey templates for event feedback.`
- `Find a customer-satisfaction survey template.`
- `List the available templates in French.`
