# Gmail MCP server

The Gmail MCP server enables AI assistants to read, organize, draft, and send emails through Gmail using natural conversation. The Gmail MCP server provides tools to discover messages and threads, retrieve full email content and attachments, compose and revise drafts, send emails, and manage inbox state without requiring direct interaction with the Gmail interface.

## Uses

Use the Gmail MCP server when you plan to perform the following actions:

- Search for conversations with specific people, customers, or groups
- Find ongoing or historical discussions about topics or projects
- Read and review complete email threads and individual messages
- Compose, draft, and send new emails or replies
- Manage attachments including viewing and retrieving files
- Organize inbox with labels, starring, and archiving
- Mark messages as read or unread for inbox management
- Triage and clean up email conversations

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Gmail MCP server tools:

- `Find all email threads with Acme Corp from the last month.`
- `Show me the conversation about the Q4 product launch.`
- `Draft a follow-up email to Sarah about the meeting yesterday.`
- `What attachments were included in the contract email from the legal team?`
- `Send the draft email I created earlier.`

## Install the Gmail MCP server

Complete the following steps to install a prebuilt MCP server to your project:

1. Sign in to your Workato account.
   
2. Go to **AI Hub > Enterprise MCP > Custom servers**.
   
3. Click **\+ Create MCP server**.
   
4. Go to the **Start with pre-built MCP Servers using your connected apps** section and select the prebuilt MCP server you plan to use.
   
5. Click **Use this server**.
   
6. Provide a name for your MCP server in the **Server name** field.
   
7. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project for the MCP server.
   
8. Go to the **Connections** section and connect to your app account.
   
9. Select the connection type you plan to use for the MCP server template.
   
   - **User's connection**: MCP server tools perform actions based on the identity and permissions of the user who connects to the application. Users authenticate with their own credentials to execute the skill.
   - **Your connection**: This option uses the connection established by the recipe builder and follows the same principles as normal app connections.
   
   ![Select your connection type](/assets/connection-type.Cor-6PJN.png)_Select your connection type_
   
   > **VERIFIED USER ACCESS AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENTS**
   > 
   > Only app connections that use OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant are available for user's connection. Refer to [Verified user access](/en/mcp/verified-user-access) for more information.
   
10. Complete the app-specific connection setup steps in the following section.
    

## Gmail connection setup

View Gmail connection setup steps

Workato supports OAuth 2.0 authentication and Service account authentication for Gmail.

### Minimum and default scopes

The **See your primary Google Account email address** scope is required to establish a connection at a minimum.

Workato requests the following scopes by default if you don't request specific scopes:

- **See your primary Google Account email address**
- **See and edit your email labels**
- **Send email on your behalf**
- **View your email messages and settings**
- **Read, compose, and send emails from your Gmail account**

Ensure your Google Workspace Admin grants [domain-wide authority delegation](https://developers.google.com/cloud-search/docs/guides/delegation#delegate_domain-wide_authority_to_your_service_account) to your service account if you plan to use a service account to connect to Gmail. This allows it to impersonate the user email entered during connection setup, with the necessary scopes and permissions.

### OAuth 2.0 authentication

View OAuth 2.0 authentication steps

Complete the following steps to set up an OAuth 2.0 connection:

1. Sign in to your Workato account and navigate to the project where you plan to add your Gmail connection.
   
2. Click **Create > Connection** (or press C twice), then select **Gmail** as your connection.
   
3. Provide a **Connection name** that uniquely identifies the Gmail connection instance.
   
4. Click the **Authentication type** menu and select **OAuth 2.0**.
   
5. Optional. Click **Advanced settings** and select additional **OAuth 2.0 scopes**. If left blank, the following scopes are requested:
   
   - **See your primary Google Account email address**
   - **See and edit your email labels**
   - **Send email on your behalf**
   - **View your email messages and settings**
   - **Read, compose, and send emails from your Gmail account**
6. Optional. Use the **Custom OAuth profile** drop-down menu to select a custom OAuth profile for your connection.
   
7. Click **Sign in with Google** and sign in to your Google account to complete the setup.
   

### Service account authentication

View Service account authentication steps

A Google service account is a specialized Google account associated with a Google Cloud Project (GCP) that can run API requests on your behalf.

Service accounts provide the following benefits:

- **Continuous operation:** Service accounts ensure that operations continue even if individual user permissions change.
- **Dedicated permissions:** Service accounts can only access projects that you share with them.
- **Dedicated API quotas:** You can manage a service account's API quotas through GCP and request quota increases directly from Google.

Refer to the [Google service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) to learn more about service accounts.

#### Set up a Google service account

View Google service account setup steps

Complete the following steps to set up a Google service account:

1. [Create a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating) in your GCP project.
   
2. Go to **IAM & Admin > Service accounts**. Ensure your dashboard is scoped to the project that contains your service account.
   
   ![Check the scope of your dashboard.](/assets/service-project-scope.8Rf50DK2.png)_Check the scope of your dashboard._
   
3. Click the **Email** of the service account you intend to use.
   
   ![Click the email of the service account you intend to use.](/assets/service-email-button.C9qaZFkJ.png)_Click the **Email** of the service account you intend to use._
   
4. Copy the service account's **Email** and save it to configure your connection later.
   
   ![Copy the account's email](/assets/service-account-email.DM6BBBhN.png)_Copy the account's **Email**._
   
5. Go to the **KEYS** tab.
   
6. [Generate a private key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating_service_account_keys) and download it in JSON format. You can only download the key once.
   
7. Open the JSON file, then copy the entire private key from `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` to `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n` (inclusive) and save it to configure your connection later.
