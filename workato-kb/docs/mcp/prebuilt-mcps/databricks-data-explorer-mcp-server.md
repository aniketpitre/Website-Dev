> The Databricks Data Explorer MCP server lets LLMs explore Unity Catalog tables, retrieve schemas, and run read-only SQL queries through conversation.

# Databricks Data Explorer MCP server

The Databricks Data Explorer MCP server enables LLMs to discover and retrieve structured data from Databricks environments governed by Unity Catalog through natural conversation. It provides tools to explore catalogs, discover tables, retrieve schema information, and run read-only queries using Unity Catalog without requiring direct interaction with the Databricks interface. Row quotas, timeouts, and concurrency quotas are applied.

## Uses

Use the Databricks Data Explorer MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Discover catalogs, schemas, tables, and views in Unity Catalog
- Search for tables by name or keyword across your data catalog
- Retrieve column definitions and table metadata
- Retrieve sample data to understand table structure and content
- Execute bounded `SELECT` queries against a designated SQL Warehouse
- Run read-only queries with automatic row quotas and timeouts
- Check execution status of long-running queries
- Retrieve results from completed asynchronous queries

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Databricks Data Explorer MCP server tools:

- `What catalogs are available in Databricks?`
- `Show me the schemas in the sales_data catalog.`
- `What tables exist in the customer_analytics schema?`
- `Find tables related to subscriptions.`
- `What columns are in the customer_events table?`
- `Show me a sample of data from the activity_logs table.`
- `Query the top 100 customers by revenue from last quarter.`
- `Get the status of my running query.`

## How to use Databricks Data Explorer MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools:

### list\_catalogs tool

The **list\_catalogs** tool lists available Unity Catalog catalogs. Your LLM uses this tool to identify available top-level data groupings before locating schemas or tables.

**Try asking**:

- `What catalogs are available in Databricks?`
- `Show me all the data catalogs I can access.`
- `List the top-level catalogs in Unity Catalog.`
- `What data groupings exist in my Databricks environment?`

### list\_schemas tool

The **list\_schemas** tool lists schemas within a Unity Catalog catalog you specify. Your LLM uses this tool to identify namespaces within a known catalog before locating tables.

**Try asking**:

- `Show me the schemas in the sales_data catalog.`
- `What schemas exist in the analytics catalog?`
- `List all schemas in the customer_data catalog.`
- `What namespaces are available in this catalog?`

### list\_tables tool

The **list\_tables** tool lists tables and views within a schema you specify. Your LLM uses this tool to discover candidate tables before constructing a query.

**Try asking**:

- `What tables exist in the customer_analytics schema?`
- `Show me all tables and views in the sales schema.`
- `List the available tables in customer_data.raw_events.`
- `What tables can I query in this schema?`

### search\_tables tool

The **search\_tables** tool searches Unity Catalog tables by name or keyword. Your LLM uses this tool to find tables based on business concepts when table names are unknown.

**Try asking**:

- `Find tables related to subscriptions.`
- `Search for tables containing customer activity data.`
- `Look for tables about support tickets.`
- `Find any tables with 'revenue' in the name.`

### get\_table\_schema tool

The **get\_table\_schema** tool retrieves column definitions and metadata for a table you specify. Your LLM uses this tool to understand table structure, column types, and available descriptions before constructing a SQL query.

**Try asking**:

- `What columns are in the customer_events table?`
- `Show me the schema for the sales.transactions table.`
- `What's the structure of the activity_logs table?`
- `Get the column definitions for the subscription_data table.`

### get\_table\_sample tool

The **get\_table\_sample** tool returns a bounded sample of rows from a table you specify. Your LLM uses this tool to understand the shape or typical values of a dataset without retrieving the full dataset.

**Try asking**:

- `Show me a sample of data from the activity_logs table.`
- `Get some example rows from the customer_events table.`
- `What does the data in the transactions table look like?`
- `Show me a few sample records from the subscriptions table.`

### execute\_query tool

The **execute\_query** tool executes a read-only SQL `SELECT` query against the configured SQL warehouse with automatic row quotas and timeouts. Your LLM uses this tool to retrieve structured data in response to business questions.

**Try asking**:

- `Query the top 100 customers by revenue from last quarter.`
- `Get all active subscriptions created in the last 30 days.`
- `Show me support tickets opened this week by priority.`
- `Find the total sales by region for January 2026.`

### get\_query\_status tool

The **get\_query\_status** tool retrieves execution status of a previously submitted asynchronous query. Your LLM uses this tool only when `execute_query` returns a `query_id`, indicating asynchronous execution.

**Try asking**:

- `Get the status of my running query.`
- `Check if my query has completed.`
- `What's the execution status of query jfsialsk32s?`
- `Is my data retrieval query still running?`

### get\_query\_results tool

The **get\_query\_results** tool retrieves results of a completed asynchronous query. Your LLM uses this tool after `get_query_status` indicates that execution has completed.

**Try asking**:

- `Get the results of my completed query.`
- `Show me the data from query 9dsdlkdsl.`
- `Retrieve the results of the customer analysis query.`
- `What did my query return?`
