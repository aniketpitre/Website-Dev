# HubSpot CRM MCP server

The HubSpot CRM MCP server enables LLMs to interact with HubSpot for core CRM record management through natural conversation. It provides tools to resolve owners, pipeline stages, and field properties and manage contacts, companies, deals, tickets, and activity timelines without requiring direct interaction with the HubSpot interface.

## Uses

Use the HubSpot CRM MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Find contacts, companies, deals, and tickets
- Create new contacts, companies, deals, and tickets, or update fields on existing records
- Move deals and tickets through pipeline stages
- Link and unlink related records
- Log notes, calls, emails, meetings, and tasks to a record's activity timeline
- Review recent activity logged against a contact, company, deal, or ticket
- Archive records that are no longer needed
- Resolve the right owner to assign to a record or activity
- Look up pipeline stages and field properties before writing a record

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke HubSpot CRM MCP server tools:

- `Find the contact for Kiran Patel at Acme Corp.`
- `Create a new deal for the Acme Corp renewal.`
- `Move this deal to Closed Won.`
- `Update the phone number on this contact.`
- `Log the call I just had with Acme Corp.`
- `Link this contact to their company.`
- `Show me open deals owned by Jade Chen.`
- `What tickets are associated with Acme Corp?`
- `Who are the available owners I can assign this deal to?`
- `List the stages in the sales pipeline.`

## Install the HubSpot CRM MCP server

Complete the following steps to install a prebuilt MCP server to your project:

1. Sign in to your Workato account.
   
2. Go to **AI Hub > Enterprise MCP > Custom servers**.
   
3. Click **\+ Create MCP server**.
   
4. Go to the **Start with pre-built MCP Servers using your connected apps** section and select the prebuilt MCP server you plan to use.
   
5. Click **Use this server**.
   
6. Provide a name for your MCP server in the **Server name** field.
   
7. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project for the MCP server.
   
8. Go to the **Connections** section and connect to your app account.
   
9. Select the connection type you plan to use for the MCP server template.
   
   - **User's connection**: MCP server tools perform actions based on the identity and permissions of the user who connects to the application. Users authenticate with their own credentials to execute the skill.
   - **Your connection**: This option uses the connection established by the recipe builder and follows the same principles as normal app connections.

   > **VERIFIED USER ACCESS AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENTS**
   > 
   > Only app connections that use OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant are available for user's connection. Refer to [Verified user access](/en/mcp/verified-user-access) for more information.
   
10. Complete the app-specific connection setup steps in the following section.

### API version

The HubSpot connector uses the [HubSpot REST API v3](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/overview).

### How to connect to HubSpot on Workato

Complete the following steps to authenticate with HubSpot using OAuth 2.0:

1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `HubSpot` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project or folder to store your connection.
   
5. Optional. Go to the **Advanced settings** section and select the scopes to provide to Workato. The connector requests the minimum set of scopes for its recipe triggers and actions by default. Refer to the complete list of [available scopes](/en/connectors/hubspot/scopes#full-list-scopes) for more information.
   
6. Optional. Use the **Custom OAuth profile** drop-down menu to select a [custom OAuth profile](/en/custom-oauth-profiles) for your connection.
   
7. Click **Connect**.
   
8. Select the HubSpot account where you plan to authorize Workato and click **Choose Account**.

### HubSpot role requirements

Each tool's availability depends on the CRM scopes granted to the connected account. HubSpot doesn't support per-user authentication for this connector, so every tool runs under a single connected account. You can use the **list\_owners** tool to resolve an owner, then set it with **create\_record** or **update\_record**. A request made without the required scope returns a permission-denied outcome rather than a partial result. Refer to the HubSpot [Scopes](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/scopes) documentation for the complete list of scope requirements.
