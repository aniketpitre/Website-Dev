### Notion connection setup

View Notion connection setup steps

Authenticate your Notion connection in Workato using one of the following methods:

- [OAuth 2.0](#oauth-2-0-authentication): Use this method for public integrations that require access across multiple Notion workspaces.
- [API key](#api-key-authentication): Use this method for internal integrations tied to a specific Notion workspace.

#### OAuth 2.0 authentication

View OAuth 2.0 authentication steps

Complete the following steps to set up your Notion connection using OAuth 2.0:

1. Enter a **Connection name** that identifies which Notion instance Workato is connected to.
   
2. Select **OAuth (Public integration)** in the **Authentication** field.
   
3. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client secret** for your Notion integration. Refer to Notion's [Public integration auth flow setup](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#public-integration-auth-flow-set-up) guide to generate these credentials.
   
4. Click **Connect** to complete the setup.

## How to use Notion Databases MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools:

### list\_databases tool

The **list\_databases** tool retrieves a list of databases accessible within your Notion workspace. Your LLM uses this tool to discover what databases exist, to select an appropriate database before creating or querying items, or to retrieve available databases.

**Try asking**:

- `What databases do I have access to in Notion?`
- `Show me all my Notion databases.`
- `List the databases in my workspace.`
- `What project trackers do I have in Notion?`

### get\_database\_schema tool

The **get\_database\_schema** tool retrieves the schema and metadata for a specified Notion database. Your LLM uses this tool to understand the structure of a database before querying items, creating new records, or updating existing ones.

**Try asking**:

- `Show me the schema for my Tasks database.`
- `What properties does the project tracker have?`
- `Get the structure of the feature requests database.`
- `What fields are in my CRM database?`

### query\_database\_items tool

The **query\_database\_items** tool searches and retrieves items from a Notion database using filters, sorting, and pagination. Your LLM uses this tool to find, list, or review database items based on criteria you specify such as status, priority, dates, ownership, or keywords.

- `Show me tasks assigned to me that are in progress.`
- `List feature requests created this month.`
- `Find all completed items from last sprint.`

### get\_database\_item tool

The **get\_database\_item** tool retrieves a single item from a Notion database by its identifier. Your LLM uses this tool to reference a specific item or inspect an item before updating it.

- `Show me the feature request item xyz789.`
- `Retrieve the information for this project tracker entry.`
- `Get the complete details for that task.`

### create\_database\_item tool

The **create\_database\_item** tool creates a new item in an existing Notion database. Your LLM uses this tool to add, log, or capture a new record such as a task, feature, issue, or note in an existing database.

**Try asking**:

- `Create a new task in my project database for the API integration.`
- `Add a feature request for dark mode support.`
- `Log a new issue in the bug tracker about the login timeout.`

- `Update the status of this task to 'In Progress'.`
- `Change the priority of the API integration task to high.`
- `Update the due date for this item to next Friday.`
- `Mark this feature request as reviewed.`

### archive\_database\_item tool

The **archive\_database\_item** tool archives an existing item in a Notion database. Your LLM uses this tool to mark tasks, records, or items as completed, obsolete, or removed from active work.

**Try asking**:

- `Archive the completed tasks from last sprint.`
