> Use the Coupa Procurement & Receiving MCP server to connect your LLM to Coupa with tools to create and track purchase requests, review and change purchase orders, record goods receipts, and search the approved catalog.

# Coupa Procurement & Receiving MCP server

The Coupa Procurement & Receiving MCP server enables LLMs to manage Coupa procurement and receiving through natural conversation. It provides tools to create and track purchase requests, review and close purchase orders, submit purchase order change requests, record goods receipts to enable three-way invoice matching, and search the approved catalog. The server resolves its own suppliers, accounts, and users, so it can be deployed on its own, without requiring direct interaction with the Coupa interface.

## Uses

Use the Coupa Procurement & Receiving MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Create purchase requests with catalog or free-form lines and submit them for native Coupa approval.
- Track a purchase request's status and approval position, and confirm purchase order generation once approved.
- Search and review purchase orders by supplier, status, date, or requester.
- Request changes to an issued purchase order, with protection against acting on stale data.
- Close purchase orders that are fully received and no longer expect further invoices.
- Record goods receipts against purchase order lines to enable three-way invoice matching.
- Search the approved catalog for line-ready item detail before adding items to a request.
- Monitor pending approval steps across purchase requests and purchase orders.
- Resolve suppliers, accounts, and users to compact reference records before a write.

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Coupa Procurement & Receiving MCP server tools:

- `Create a purchase request for 10 laptop stands from Acme Corp, coded to the Facilities account.`
- `Submit my draft purchase request for approval.`
- `Where does my purchase request for office chairs stand?`
- `Show me all purchase orders from Acme Corp issued this quarter.`
- `Has this purchase order been received yet?`
- `Request a quantity change on this purchase order before I approve the invoice.`
- `Close this purchase order, everything on it has been received.`
- `Record a receipt of 5 units against this purchase order line.`
- `Find approved catalog items for standing desks.`
- `What's waiting in my approval queue right now?`

### API version

The Coupa connector uses the [Coupa Core REST API](https://compass.coupa.com/en-us/products/product-documentation/integration-technical-documentation/the-coupa-core-api).

### How to connect to Coupa with OAuth 2.0

The Coupa connector has supported OAuth 2.0-based connectivity since January 2022. OAuth connections are more secure than API key-based connections. OAuth lets you specify the exact scopes you plan to use in the Workato connection settings. The Coupa connector supports OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials and OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant connections. Refer to [OpenID Connect Clients](https://compass.coupa.com/en-us/products/product-documentation/integration-technical-documentation/the-coupa-core-api/oauth-2.0-and-oidc/openid-connect-clients) for more information.

View OAuth connection setup steps

1. Sign in to your Coupa instance, for example `https://[your-instance-name].coupacloud.com/oauth2/clients`.
   
2. Click **Create** to create a new OAuth client.
   
3. Use the **Grant type** drop-down menu to select **Authorization Code** or **Client Credentials**. You must select the same option in Workato for the **Authentication type**.

#### Coupa role requirements

Each tool's availability depends on the permissions granted to the connected account. Actions run with the authenticated user's own Coupa permissions through [Verified user access](/en/mcp/verified-user-access), using an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant connection instead of a shared service account. A request made without the required permission returns a permission-denied outcome rather than a partial result.

### Project property configuration

The Coupa Procurement & Receiving MCP server supports the following project-level properties to control behavior and defaults:

| Project-level property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `requisition_custom_field_schema` | Specify the tenant-required purchase request custom fields, and how to supply them to **create\_requisition**. |
| `po_change_allowed_fields` | Specify header and line fields the tenant permits in a purchase order change request. |
| `po_change_reason_mapping` | Specify valid purchase order change reason values, the Coupa field they map to, and whether a reason is required. |
| `default_receiving_warehouse_id` | Configure the default receiving warehouse used by **create\_receipt**. This isn't exposed as a tool parameter. |
| `default_receiving_warehouse_location_id` | Configure the default receiving warehouse location used by **create\_receipt**. This isn't exposed as a tool parameter. |
| `idempotency_retention_days` | Enter the retention window, in days, for the server-layer duplicate-protection store. The minimum is `1`, the maximum is `30`, and the default is `7`. |
| `budget_enforcement` | Configure the MCP-layer budget preflight policy that applies when submitting a purchase request. Options include `block`, `advisory`, and `off`. The default is `block`. This doesn't override Coupa's own native budget validation, which still applies in every mode. |
