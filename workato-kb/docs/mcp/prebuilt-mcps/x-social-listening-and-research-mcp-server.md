## How to use X Social Listening and Research MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools:

### search\_tweets tool

The **search\_tweets** tool searches public tweets matching a keyword, hashtag, mention, or phrase. Your LLM uses this tool to find tweets about specific topics, monitor brand mentions, track hashtags, or discover conversations.

**Try asking**:

- `Search for recent tweets mentioning our product.`
- `Find tweets about #AI automation from the past week.`
- `Look for tweets mentioning @acme.`
- `Search for conversations about low-code platforms.`

### get\_tweet tool

The **get\_tweet** tool retrieves a single tweet with full metadata by tweet ID. Your LLM uses this tool when you provide a specific tweet ID or URL to retrieve full details of a particular tweet, or to follow up after a search to get complete metadata on a specific result.

**Try asking**:

- `Get the details for tweet ID 1234567890.`

- `Retrieve the engagement metrics for this specific tweet.`
- `Get complete information about tweet 123456.`

### get\_tweet\_thread tool

The **get\_tweet\_thread** tool retrieves the full conversation thread for a tweet you specify. Your LLM uses this tool to understand the full context of a conversation, read a thread, see replies to a specific tweet, or to understand the full exchange when a search result appears to be part of a larger discussion.

**Try asking**:

- `Show me the full thread for this tweet.`
- `Read the entire conversation thread.`
- `Get all the replies in this X thread.`
- `Show me the complete discussion starting from this tweet.`

### get\_user\_profile tool

The **get\_user\_profile** tool retrieves the public profile of an X account by handle or user ID. Your LLM uses this tool to look up an X account, find information about a specific @handle, understand an account's reach and focus area, or verify an account.

**Try asking**:

- `Look up the @acme X profile.`
- `Get information about @competitor's account.`
- `What's the follower count for @brandaccount?`
- `Verify the profile for @influencer.`

### get\_user\_recent\_tweets tool

**Try asking**:

- `What has @competitor been posting recently?`
- `Show me @acme's recent tweets.`
- `Get the latest posts from @brandaccount.`
- `Review what @influencer has tweeted this week.`

### search\_users tool

The **search\_users** tool searches for X accounts matching a name, keyword, or topic description. Your LLM uses this tool to find accounts related to a topic, industry, or keyword rather than looking up a known handle, or for influencer discovery and finding brand accounts.

**Try asking**:

- `Find X accounts that post about AI automation.`
- `Search for accounts focused on B2B SaaS.`
- `Discover influencers in the marketing technology space.`
- `Find brand accounts related to customer success.`

### batch\_get\_tweet\_metrics tool

The **batch\_get\_tweet\_metrics** tool retrieves engagement metrics for a batch of tweet IDs in a single call. Your LLM uses this tool only when comparing or ranking engagement across 5 or more tweets where the tweet content has already been retrieved and only metrics are needed.

**Try asking**:

- `Compare engagement metrics for these five tweets.`
- `Which of these tweets performed best?`
- `Get the metrics for this batch of tweet IDs.`
- `Rank these tweets by engagement.`
