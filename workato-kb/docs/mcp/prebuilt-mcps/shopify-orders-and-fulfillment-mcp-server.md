## How to use Shopify Orders and Fulfillment MCP server tools

Refer to the following sections for detailed information on available tools:

### get\_order tool

The **get\_order** tool retrieves complete details for a single order given an order identifier. Your LLM uses this tool to retrieve comprehensive order information including line items, shipping address, payment status, fulfillment status, and tracking information.

**Try asking**:

- `Get the details for order #1234.`
- `Show me the complete information for order 5678.`
- `Look up order #9012 and tell me its status.`
- `What items are in order #3456?`

### search\_orders tool

The **search\_orders** tool searches orders matching the filter criteria you specify including customer email, fulfillment status, financial status, date range, and tags. Your LLM uses this tool to find orders matching specific criteria rather than looking up one specific order.

**Try asking**:

- `Find all orders from customer@acme.com.`
- `Show me paid but unfulfilled orders.`
- `Search for orders from last week.`
- `Find orders tagged 'wholesale'.`

### list\_unfulfilled\_orders tool

The **list\_unfulfilled\_orders** tool retrieves orders with unfulfilled or partially fulfilled status, optimized for fulfillment queue management. Your LLM uses this tool to retrieve orders that haven't shipped. Results are sorted by creation date in ascending order (oldest first) to support fulfillment workflows.

**Try asking**:

- `What orders need to ship?`
- `Show me unfulfilled orders.`
- `What's in the fulfillment queue?`
- `What orders are pending shipment?`

### fulfill\_order tool

The **fulfill\_order** tool creates a fulfillment record for an order, marking items as shipped with tracking information. Your LLM uses this tool to mark orders as shipped and associate tracking numbers. This tool fulfills one location per call.

**Try asking**:

- `Mark order #1234 as fulfilled with tracking number 1Z000000010123456789.`
- `Fulfill order #5678 and use UPS as the carrier.`
- `Ship order #9012 with FedEx tracking 773189420346.`
- `Mark order #3456 as shipped.`

### cancel\_order tool

The **cancel\_order** tool cancels an order that hasn't been fulfilled. Your LLM uses this tool to cancel orders with options for refunding to the original payment method, restocking inventory, and notifying the customer. This tool requires a cancellation reason for record-keeping.

**Try asking**:

- `Cancel order #1234 and refund the customer.`
- `Cancel order #5678 due to customer request.`
- `Cancel this order and restock the inventory.`
- `Process a cancellation for order #9012 with a refund.`

### update\_order\_note tool

The **update\_order\_note** tool adds or updates the internal staff note on an order. Your LLM uses this tool to document customer interactions, special handling instructions, issue resolution, or internal communication. Notes are visible to staff in Shopify Admin but aren't visible to customers.

**Try asking**:

- `Add a note to order #1234 about the customer's delivery request.`
- `Document on order #5678 that the customer called about shipping.`
- `Update the internal note for order #9012 with resolution details.`
- `Add a staff note to order #3456 for special handling.`
