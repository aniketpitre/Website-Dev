# Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM MCP server

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM MCP server lets LLMs work with Microsoft Dynamics 365 for core sales and service CRM workflows. It provides tools to search, create, update, and transition accounts, contacts, leads, opportunities, and cases without requiring direct interaction with the Microsoft Dynamics 365 interface.

## Uses

Use the Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM MCP server to perform the following actions:

- Find accounts, contacts, leads, opportunities, and cases by name, email, phone, or other identifying details
- Create new records or update fields on existing accounts, contacts, leads, opportunities, and cases
- Qualify a lead, and optionally create related account, contact, and opportunity records
- Resolve, reassign, or move a case to a different queue
- Record a win or loss outcome on an opportunity
- Log tasks, calls, appointments, and notes against a record
- Retrieve records related to an account, contact, lead, opportunity, or case
- Look up field definitions and choice values before creating or updating a record

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM MCP server tools:

- `Find the lead for Alex Patel at Acme Corp.`
- `Qualify this lead and create the related opportunity.`
- `Update the estimated close date on this opportunity.`
- `Log the call I just had with Acme Corp.`
- `Resolve this case with a note explaining the fix.`
- `Reassign this case to Kai Lee.`

### Microsoft Dynamics 365 role requirements

Every tool call runs under the Dataverse security role and row-level permissions of the connected account, not a separate service account. Read tools only return records and related data that the connected account's security role and row-level access permit. A request that calls for a privilege the connected account doesn't have fails rather than returning a partial result. Refer to [Create or edit a security role to manage access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/create-edit-security-role) for the complete list of role capabilities.
