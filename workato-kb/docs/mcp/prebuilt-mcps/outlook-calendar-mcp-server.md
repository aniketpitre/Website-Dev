> Use the Outlook Calendar MCP server to connect your LLM to Outlook Calendar with a curated set of tools to retrieve events, check availability, and create, update, or delete calendar entries.

# Outlook Calendar MCP server

The Outlook Calendar MCP server enables LLMs to read, interpret, and modify calendar data stored in Microsoft Outlook Calendar through natural conversation. It provides tools to retrieve events, check availability, and create, update, or delete calendar entries without requiring direct interaction with the Outlook interface.

## Uses

Use the Outlook Calendar MCP server when you plan to perform the following actions:

- View upcoming or past calendar events for planning or reporting
- Check availability for yourself or other attendees to support scheduling
- Retrieve full details for specific events
- Schedule new meetings, focus time, or out-of-office events
- Reschedule, update, or cancel existing calendar events
- Access multiple calendars including shared and delegate calendars
- Find open time slots for meetings or personal time
- Manage recurring meetings and series

### Example prompts

Use the following example prompts to invoke Outlook Calendar MCP server tools:

- `What's on my calendar for this week?`
- `Schedule a 30-minute meeting with Alex and Priya next Tuesday.`
- `When am I free tomorrow afternoon?`
- `Get the details for my 2pm meeting today.`
- `Move my standup meeting to 10am instead of 9am.`
- `Cancel the budget review meeting on Friday.`
- `What calendars do I have access to?`
- `Find a time when Sarah and I are both free this week.`

- [Client credentials-based authentication (OAuth 2.0)](#authentication-client-credentials): _Only available for tenant-specific connections_

> **MICROSOFT MFA ENFORCEMENT**
> 
> Microsoft is rolling out mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA) gradually to different applications and accounts in phases. This enforcement continues throughout 2025 and beyond. Refer to the Microsoft [Mandatory multifactor authentication for Azure and admin portals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication?tabs=dotnet) documentation for more information.
> 
> We strongly recommend enabling MFA now for all Microsoft accounts used with Workato to avoid service disruptions from short-notice enforcement changes.
> 
> Complete the following steps to maintain uninterrupted service:
> 
> 1. Enable MFA for your Microsoft organization following the Microsoft MFA setup guide. Refer to [Set up multifactor authentication for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide) for more information.

**Try asking**:

- `When am I free tomorrow afternoon?`
- `Find a time when Sarah and I are both free this week.`
- `Check my availability for Thursday between 2pm and 5pm.`
- `When are Alex, Mei, and I all available next week?`

### create\_event tool

The **create\_event** tool creates a new Outlook Calendar event. Your LLM uses this tool to schedule a new meeting or call, add a calendar hold or focus time block, create a recurring event, block off PTO or OOO time, or create follow-up meetings.

**Try asking**:

- `Schedule a 30-minute meeting with Marco and Jade next Tuesday at 2pm.`
- `Create a recurring weekly standup every Monday at 9am.`
- `Block off next Friday as PTO.`
- `Set up a focus time block for tomorrow morning from 9am to 11am.`

### update\_event tool

The **update\_event** tool updates an existing Outlook Calendar event with new details including time, attendees, description, or recurrence. Your LLM uses this tool to move or reschedule a meeting, shorten or extend an event's duration, add, remove, or update attendees, update meeting descriptions or agendas, or modify a recurring series.

**Try asking**:

- `Move my standup meeting to 10am instead of 9am.`
- `Reschedule the budget review to next Wednesday.`
- `Add Josh to the product planning meeting.`
- `Extend my 1pm meeting by 30 minutes.`
