> Manage MCP server tools from the Details tab to start, stop, add, and remove tools and edit the LLM-facing server description.

# Manage MCP server tools

You can manage MCP tools and tool annotation within the MCP server **Details** tab. The **Details** tab provides a list of tools in your MCP server, your Remote MCP URL, and authentication method.

## Edit LLM-facing MCP server description

Your MCP server description is automatically shared with your LLM when you connect the MCP server. You can update the description for your specific use cases and to include any tool customization you perform. An accurate MCP server description helps your LLM know when to use specific tools.

Complete the following steps to edit the MCP server description shared with your LLM:

1. Sign in to your Workato account.
   
2. Go to **AI Hub > Enterprise MCP > Custom servers**.
   
3. Select the MCP server where you plan to edit the LLM-facing MCP server description.
   
4. Go to the **Description** section and click the edit icon.
   
5. Update the description.

6. Click the save icon.
   

## Manage tools

You can start, stop, add, and remove tools in the **Details** tab. You can also edit the tool name, title, and recipe.

## Manage tool annotation

Tool annotation lets you guide how AI agents treat a tool in your MCP server. You can enable the following tool annotation settings:

- **Read-only (readOnlyHint)**: Enable this setting to let an agent know it can run this tool without confirmation. This setting can only be used with **Open world (openWorldHint)**.
- **Destructive (destructiveHint)**: Enable this setting to let an agent know that the tool may delete or overwrite data. The agent shows a warning before running this tool. This setting can be used with **Safe to retry (idempotentHint)** and **Open world (openWorldHint)**.
- **Safe to retry (idempotentHint)**: Enable this setting to let the agent know it can call this tool repeatedly without side effects. This setting can be used with **Destructive (destructiveHint)** and **Open world (openWorldHint)**.
- **Open world (openWorldHint)**: Enable this setting to let the agent know that the tool uses data from outside systems. The agent treats this data as untrusted. This setting can be used with **Destructive (destructiveHint)** and **Safe to retry (idempotentHint)**.

Complete the following steps to manage tool annotation:

1. Sign in to your Workato account.
   
2. Go to **AI Hub > Enterprise MCP > Custom servers**.
   
3. Select the MCP server that contains the tools you plan to edit.
   
4. Go to the **Tools** section and select the checkboxes for the tools where you plan to configure tool annotations.
