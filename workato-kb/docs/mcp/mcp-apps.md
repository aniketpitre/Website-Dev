> MCP Apps lets tools return interactive tables, forms, and dashboards inside the LLM chat so users view, sort, and act on data without leaving the conversation.

# MCP Apps

MCP Apps is an open standard that enables tools to return interactive elements, such as tables, forms, images, buttons, or dashboards directly inside the LLM chat as an embedded application. The embedded application functions as a web page directly within the end-user's conversation.

Workato MCP Apps lets end users view, sort, filter, and interact with real data without leaving the chat. For example, a tool that queries SAP, Salesforce, and ServiceNow can show the combined results as a sortable table with approve and reject buttons rather than a text summary.

> Refer to the [GitHub interactive images MCP app](/en/getting-started/use-cases/mcp/github-mcp-app) use case for a step-by-step guide on how to create an MCP app that enables you to view, pan, and zoom your GitHub repo images directly in your LLM, such as ChatGPT, Claude, or Cursor.

## When to use MCP Apps

Use MCP Apps in the following scenarios:

- **Complex data**: Data from multiple sources is easier to interpret when you can filter and sort the data.
  
- **Rich media**: An MCP App embeds a viewer that enables users to zoom and pan generated images or PDFs rather than relying on text descriptions that fail to fully capture the information users need.
  
- **[Multi-step workflows](/en/agentic/agent-studio/design-workflows-with-multiple-steps#design-genie-workflows-with-multiple-steps)**: An MCP App can add approve and reject buttons when using workflows with items that require individual review, such as expense reports, time off requests, or issue escalation.
