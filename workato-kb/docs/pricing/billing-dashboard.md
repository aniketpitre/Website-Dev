> Use the Workato Billing and Usage dashboard to track credit utilization and view credit consumption broken down by product category.

# Billing and Usage dashboard

The **Billing and Usage** dashboard tracks credit consumption across your workspace and breaks it down by usage type. You can use it to see how credits are used across usage types, catch spikes in usage, and plan for renewal or overage.

You must have the [Environment admin](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/system-environment-roles#environment-admin) or [legacy Admin](/en/roles#role-admin) system role, or a custom role with the **Usage dashboard** privilege, to access the **Billing and usage** dashboard.

> Some plans use an alternate metric in the [Usage dashboard](/en/pricing/usage). Refer to your contract or contact your Customer Success Representative for more information.

## Billing

The **Billing** tab shows credit usage during the current billing period. Sections vary across standard, AHQ, and Embedded workspaces. Review the section for your workspace.
