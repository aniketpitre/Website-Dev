# IDP (Intelligent Document Processing) usage

Workato measures IDP usage in Pages. IDP usage is added on top of the usage of the asset it runs in, such as a workflow recipe's Tasks, an API recipe's API Calls, or a skill's Tasks.

## IDP calculation rules

IDP usage calculations follow the general [usage calculation rules](/en/pricing/usage-metrics#rules), where successful pages count toward usage and failed processing attempts are excluded.

Workato applies the following additional rules to calculate Pages:

- Each page, whether standalone or part of a multi-page document, counts as 1 Page.
- A failed IDP action doesn't count. Pages from a successful retry count.

## IDP usage examples

The following examples demonstrate how Workato calculates IDP usage in different scenarios.

### IDP within a workflow recipe

**Recipe**

![IDP step within a workflow](/assets/idp.B0AWVYvx.png)_IDP within a workflow_

**Explanation**

Each page, whether standalone or part of a multi-page document, counts as 1 Page. In this example, the document contains 3 pages. The total Pages for a job is the sum of all Pages.

IDP usage is calculated in addition to Tasks. The total usage of a workflow recipe job is the total Tasks + total Pages.

The IDP step itself doesn't count as a Task. This recipe contains one eligible action step outside the loop, which counts as 1 Task. A `Repeat for each` loop runs the `Create a new record in IDP_INVOICE_LINES` action once per line item in the document. Each iteration counts as 1 Task.

#### Usage totals

- **Tasks**: 1 + N, where N is the number of iterations of the `Repeat for each` loop
- **Pages**: 3
- **Total usage per job**: 1 + N Tasks, 3 Pages

### IDP within a Managed API recipe

```

Total usage: N API Calls + 2 Pages

**Recipe**

![IDP step within a Managed API recipe](/assets/idp-api.CtiuYTOp.png)_IDP step within a Managed API recipe_

**Explanation**

Each page, whether standalone or part of a multi-page document, counts as 1 Page. In this example, the document contains 2 pages.

IDP usage is calculated in addition to API Calls. The total usage of this job is the total Pages plus the API Calls incurred by the Managed API recipe.

#### Usage totals

- **Pages**: 2
- **Total usage per job**: 2 Pages, plus the API Calls incurred by the Managed API recipe

### IDP within a skill invoked over MCP

**Overview**

```mermaid
%%{init: {'themeVariables': {'fontSize': '18px'}, 'flowchart': {'padding': 4, 'nodePadding': 4}}}%%
flowchart LR
    MC(["&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCP client&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;request&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"]) <--> MS["<br/><br/><br/><br/>MCP<br/>Server<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"]
    MS <--> S
    subgraph S["Skill"]
        direction TB
        I["IDP step<br/>(2 Pages)"]
        SS["Action steps<br/>(3 Tasks)"]
        I ~~~ SS
    end
    classDef default fill:#fff,stroke:#67eadd,stroke-width:2px,color:#000;
    classDef Gateway fill:#e1fffc,stroke:#67eadd,stroke-width:2px,color:#24434f;
    classDef Recipe stroke:#5159f6,stroke-width:2px,fill:#fff;
    classDef Focus fill:#e2e0f5,stroke:#5159f6,stroke-width:2px,color:#000;
    class MS Gateway
    class S Recipe
    class I Focus
    class SS Focus
    class MC Focus
```

Total usage: 3 Tasks + 2 Pages

**Explanation**

Each of a skill's executed action steps counts as 1 Task when invoked over MCP. Pages are counted on top of the skill's Tasks when it includes an IDP step. In this example, the skill processes a 2-page document and executes 3 action steps.

#### Usage totals

- **Tasks**: 3
- **Pages**: 2
- **Total usage per invocation**: 3 Tasks + 2 Pages

### Failed IDP operation

**Recipe**

![Failed IDP step within a workflow](/assets/idp-failed.BoIdqeju.png)_Failed IDP step within a workflow_

**Explanation**

Each page, whether standalone or part of a multi-page document, counts as 1 Page. In this example, the document contains 2 pages. The total Pages for a job is the sum of all Pages.

A failed IDP action doesn't count as Pages. In this example, the IDP action fails on the first attempt but succeeds after a retry.

IDP usage is calculated in addition to Tasks, but no workflow steps in this recipe qualify as Tasks.

#### Usage totals

- **Tasks**: 0
- **Pages**: 2
- **Total usage per job**: 0 Tasks, 2 Pages
