> Configure Microsoft Entra ID to sync Workato environment roles and collaborator groups through SAML attribute mapping at user sign-in.

# Microsoft Entra ID SAML role sync configuration

Workato supports role and group synchronization through Microsoft Entra ID using SAML attribute mapping:

- Environment roles are passed through SAML attributes such as `workato_role`, `workato_role_test`, and `workato_role_prod`.
- Collaborator groups are passed through the `workato_user_groups` attribute.

Roles and group memberships update the next time the user signs in with SAML SSO.

This page walks through configuring Microsoft Entra ID to sync Workato roles for common environments, such as DEV (default), PROD, and TEST.

> **MIGRATION TO THE NEW PERMISSIONS MODEL**
> 
> If your organization is migrating from the legacy permissions model to the new permissions model, update your SAML configurations in Microsoft Entra ID. Workato doesn't automatically translate existing assignments. Update the following:
> 
> - Create Entra groups that represent Workato environment roles (for example, `WKT-DEV-ADMIN`, `WKT-PROD-MEMBER`) and map them to SAML attributes such as `workato_role`, `workato_role_prod`, and `workato_role_test`.
> - Configure a SAML group claim to send group display names in the `workato_user_groups` attribute. Use a consistent naming convention (for example, `WKT | Admin | Finance`) to align Entra groups with Workato collaborator groups.
> 
> You can test by assigning an Entra group to the Workato application and reviewing the [Activity audit log](/en/features/activity-audit-log) to confirm the correct role and group claims.

## Prerequisites

- Configure the SAML SSO for your Microsoft Entra ID organization.
- Enable just-in-time provisioning in the Workato UI.
- Use SAML SSO enforcement for your team or organization.

## Set up role sync

Complete the following steps to set up role sync:

1. Go to **Enterprise Applications > Workato > Single Sign On > Attributes & Claims > + Add a new claim** in Microsoft Entra ID.
   
2. Enter `workato_role_prod` in the **Name** field.
   
   ![Setting SAML claims on Microsoft Entra ID](/assets/saml-azure-workato-role.8ljxq9Lb.png)_Setting SAML claims on Microsoft Entra ID_
   
3. Optional. Enter a **Namespace** URL.
   
4. Select **Attribute** for the **Source** field.
   
5. Define **Claim conditions** that must be true to generate a claim. Use these fields to control how members of your groups inherit the **Value**.
   
6. Select a **User type** from the drop-down menu. For example, select **Members**.
   
7. Select the Microsoft Entra group you created earlier that corresponds to the Workato role in the **Scoped Groups** field. For example, `WKT-DEV-ADMIN` or `WKT-PROD-MEMBER`.
   
   > **MULTIPLE GROUPS**
   > 
   > For users who belong to multiple groups, Microsoft Entra ID assigns roles based on the order of specified conditions. See [Emitting claims based on conditions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-saml-claims-customization?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_AAD_IAM#emitting-claims-based-on-conditions).
   
8. Select **Attribute** in the **Source** field.
   
9. Enter a **Value**. This is the role Workato assigns when the condition is true. For example, set **DevOps\_Admin** or **Environment admin**.
   
10. Optional. Configure additional conditions to control how group membership maps to roles.
    
11. Click **Save**.
    

> **GROUP REQUIREMENT**
> 
> Before you configure role claims, create Microsoft Entra groups that represent your Workato environment roles. Use a consistent naming convention, such as the following:
> 
> - WKT-DEV-ADMIN
> - WKT-DEV-MEMBER
> - WKT-TEST-ADMIN
> - WKT-TEST-MEMBER
> - WKT-PROD-ADMIN
> - WKT-PROD-MEMBER
> 
> Your organization can choose different names, but you'll reference these groups later when you define claim conditions.

## Configure environment-specific Workato roles in Microsoft Entra ID

You can add additional role claims for each environment in your Workato workspace.

_Attribute Statements for workato\_role in Microsoft Entra ID_

In our example, we use multiple claims to specify the roles in Workato's different environments. For example, in addition to the generic `workato_role`, we define `workato_role_prod` for the production environment, and `workato_role_test` for the test environment. Note also that the **Value** field for these roles contains multiple conditions, depending on the group membership.

## Configure collaborator groups in Microsoft Entra ID

Workato collaborator groups are passed from Entra ID to Workato as a group claim. Group claims allow you to decide what values to send in the SAML assertion, such as the group ID or the group display name.

We recommend sending group display names. This ensures Entra groups remain consistent with your Workato collaborator groups. These names must exactly match existing collaborator groups in Workato. For example:

```text
WKT | Admin | Reusable Assets
WKT | Admin | Sensitive Projects
WKT | Builder | Finance
WKT | Viewer | Reusable Assets
```

You can define a group claim that passes these display names in the `workato_user_groups` attribute. Any user assigned to those Entra groups automatically passes the corresponding collaborator group values to Workato during SAML SSO:

1. Go to **Enterprise Applications > Workato > Single Sign On > Attributes & Claims > + Add a group claim** in Microsoft Entra ID.
   
   _Configure group claims_
   
2. Select **Groups assigned to the application** in the **Which groups associated with the user should be returned in the claim?** field.
   
3. Set the **Source attribute** to **Cloud-only group display names**.
   
4. Enable the **Customize the name of the group claim** checkbox.
   
5. Enter `workato_user_groups` in the **Name** field. The value sent is the display name of the Entra group. For example, `WKT | Admin | Finance`.
   
6. **Save** the configuration.
   

Next, [assign the Entra groups](#assign-groups-to-the-workato-app) you created to the Workato application. When a user signs in, Workato assigns them to any collaborator groups that match the values in the `workato_user_groups` claim. If no claim is passed, the user signs in without collaborator groups.

## Assign groups to the Workato app

After you define claims, assign groups in Microsoft Entra ID to the Workato app:

1. Go to **Enterprise Applications > Workato > Users and groups** in Microsoft Entra ID.
   
2. Select **Add user/group**.
   
   _Assign groups to the Workato app_
   
3. Choose the environment groups and collaborator groups you created earlier.
   
4. Assign the groups. You don't need to assign an application role. Workato applies access entirely through SAML claims.
   

## Update the user role in Microsoft Entra ID

To update a user’s role, you can change the user’s group membership, or change the claim attribute role value.

## Verify role changes

If your organization uses Workato's Activity Audit Logs feature, you can verify the automatic role sync when the user logs in through SAML SSO.

Role changes triggered by SAML assertions appear under the **Source** attribute, with the value `saml_auto_sync`.

Manual role changes made in Workato UI appear use the source `user`.

You can also see the **New Role** and **Previous Role** values.
