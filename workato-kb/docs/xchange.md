> Workato XChange is a package management and distribution platform that lets organizations package, govern, and distribute automation assets across workspaces.

# XChange

XChange is a package management and distribution platform that enables organizations to standardize and govern automation assets across workspaces.

Builders package automation assets such as MCP servers, Genies, recipes, connections, and lookup tables, and submit them for review. Curators review and approve package versions, and control distribution through two models. Curators can publish packages to a private community where tenant workspace users can browse and install them, or distribute packages directly into tenant workspaces.

This creates a governed, end-to-end pipeline from asset creation and approval to controlled distribution and visibility into installed versions.

> **AVAILABILITY**
> 
> XChange is available for Automation HQ and Embedded workspaces. Contact your Workato representative to enable XChange for your organization.

## Roles and permissions

XChange uses role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to package creation, curation, and consumption.

The following roles are used throughout this guide:

- **Builder**: Packages automation assets.
- **Curator**: Reviews and approves package versions and manages distribution.
- **Consumer**: Users in tenant workspaces who browse, install, and use packages. The **XChange** tab in Admin privileges controls access to package creation, curation, and consumption.

The following permissions map to these roles and define what actions each role can perform:

- [Package creation](#package-creation)
- [Curation](#curation)
- [Consumption](#consumption)

3. Click a package to open the [Versions](#versions) page.
   

### Package statuses

The XChange dashboard groups packages by status:

![Package statuses](/assets/package-statuses.DyfiiTdp.png)_Package statuses_

- Packages pending review
  
- Packages that require approval from you.
  
- Drafts
  
- Package versions in progress. You can save a new package version as a draft and resume it later.
  
- Submitted packages
  
- Packages you submitted that require approval from another user. You can't take action on your own submissions.
  
- Rejected packages
  
- Packages you submitted that were rejected.
  

### Search and filter packages

Builders and curators can use the **Search packages** bar to find packages by name.

![Filter packages](/assets/filter-packages.BGro7Dnp.png)_Filter packages_

You can also filter the list using the following filters:

- **All packages**: Filter by status, such as Pending review, Ready to distribute, or Rejected
- **All builders**: Show packages created by a specific builder

## Create a package

Builders create packages by selecting projects and grouping relevant assets into a versioned release.

You can click **Save draft & close** at any point in the creation flow to save your progress. Drafts appear under **Drafts** on the [XChange dashboard](#package-statuses), where you can resume them later.

You can start a new package from scratch or import an existing package from a `.zip` file when you create a package. Refer to [Import a package](#import-a-package) to build from an exported package.

Complete the following steps to create a new package:

1. Click **XChange** in the navigation panel.
   
2. Click **Create package** on the XChange dashboard.
   
   ![Create a package](/assets/create-a-package.BgOIXTVD.png)_Create a package_

Complete the following steps to import a package:

1. Click **Create package** on the XChange dashboard.
   
2. Select **Import**, then click **Next**.
   
   ![Import a package](/assets/create-package-import.CSVjFQH5.png)_Import a package_
   
3. Upload the `.zip` file you plan to import.
   
4. Review the imported assets, then click **Next**.
   
   > **IMPORTED ASSETS**
   > 
   > An imported package includes every asset in the `.zip` file. You can't select or deselect individual assets during import, unlike the standard [Create a package](#create-a-package) flow.
   
5. Complete the **Package details** and **Version details** steps. These fields match the standard [Create a package](#create-a-package) flow.
   
6. Click **Next** to create the package.
   

### Versions

The **Versions** tab displays all versions of the package in a table.

![Versions tab](/assets/versions-tab.BbyIGj-z.png)_Versions tab_

Builders and curators use this tab to review version history, track adoption, and manage package updates, including creating new versions using the **Create new version** button.

The **Installations** column shows the total number of installations for each version. Hover over the bar to view a breakdown of library installations from the private community and direct installations to workspaces.

![View installations](/assets/view-installations.IpzZ0Hqu.png)_View installations_

Selecting a version opens its [details page](#version-details).

#### Export a package version

You can download any version of a package as a `.zip` file. Click the download icon on a version row in the **Versions** tab to export that version.

![Export a package version](/assets/export-version.p_cLADwH.png)_Export a package version_

You can import an exported `.zip` file back into XChange to start a new package. Refer to [Import a package](#import-a-package).

#### Version details

The version details page provides information about the selected version, including description, release notes, and status.

![Version details page](/assets/version-details-page.Df398j8P.png)_Version details page_

The page includes the following:

- **Description**: Overview of the package functionality
- **Release notes**: Full list of changes included in the version
- **Status**: The current state, such as **Published**
- **Installations**: Library and direct installation counts

The page also includes the following tabs:

- **Details**: View description, release notes, and version information
- **Contents**: View included assets such as recipes and connections

### Usage metrics

The **Usage metrics** tab displays installation data for the selected version across workspaces.

![Usage metrics page](/assets/usage-metrics.B-7bbqDl.png)_Usage metrics page_

The **Installations overview** chart shows the number of installations per version. Builders and curators use this view to compare adoption across versions and identify trends.

The customers table provides a detailed view of installations by workspace. This includes the customer name, installed version, installation timestamp, and installation type, such as library or direct installation.

## Review and approve a new package

Curators review submitted packages, validate contents, and approve or reject versions. Packages submitted by curators bypass review when the [Auto-approve packages submitted by curators](#auto-approve-curator-packages) setting is enabled.

### Open a pending package

Packages awaiting approval are available on the XChange dashboard.

Complete the following steps to open a pending package:

1. Click **XChange** in the navigation panel.
   
2. Locate and click the package labeled **Pending review**.
   
   ![XChange dashboard](/assets/xchange-dashboard.BWA04a2a.png)_XChange dashboard_
   
   The package opens with two primary tabs:
   
   - **Details**: Review the description, version, package name, and release notes.
   - **Contents**: Inspect package recipes, connections, and lookup tables in their original folder structure.
   
   > **VERSION LOCK**
   > 
   > Workato disables **Create new version** when a version remains in **Pending review**. You must complete or reopen the review before creating another version.
   

### Submit your review

Reviews allow curators to approve or reject a package with optional comments attached to explain your decision.

Complete the following steps to submit your decision when you finish reviewing the package:

1. Click **Review package** or **Review version** on the package card.
   
   ![Add package details](/assets/review-package.Bp_UvAAW.png)_Add package details_
   
2. Choose **Approve** or **Reject**.
   
3. Optional. Enter **Comments** to explain your decision or request changes.
   
4. Click **Submit**.
   

Workato sets the version status to **Ready to distribute** after approval. This indicates that the package has passed review.

After approval, you can distribute a package to workspaces or publish the package to a library.

## Publish a package to library

Curators publish an approved package version to a library so external users can discover and install it. Publishing makes the version visible in the library you chose and replaces existing published versions. Users with access can install this version.

Complete the following steps to publish to a private library:

1. Open an approved package.
   
2. Click **Publish**.
   
   ![Publish a package](/assets/publish-package.B29DDkD5.png)_Publish a package_
   
3. Enter a short summary of the package in the **Card description** field. You can write your own text or click **Generate** to have AIRO create a description automatically.
   
   ![Enter a card description](/assets/enter-card-description.DwHyOpBx.png)_Enter a card description_
   
4. Use the **Card preview** to review how the description appears in the library after publishing.
   
5. Click **Publish** to confirm.
   
   ![Package published to library](/assets/package-published.CAt2JiXU.png)_Package published to library_
   

Workato sets the package status to **Published**.

### Unpublish a package version

Curators unpublish a package version to remove it from a library.

Complete the following steps to remove a version from the library:

1. Click **Unpublish**.
   
2. Confirm the unpublish action when prompted. This removes the version from the library but keeps it available in XChange.
   

## Distribute a package to workspaces

Curators can distribute a published package version directly to one or more tenant workspaces. This bypasses the self-serve library and installs the package's assets, such as recipes, connections, and lookup tables, into the target tenant environments.

Distribution supports both one-time pushes and ongoing version updates across previously-distributed workspaces.

Complete the following steps to distribute a package to workspaces:

1. Open a published package from the XChange dashboard.
   
2. Click **Distribute to workspaces**.
   
   ![Distribute a package to workspaces](/assets/distribute-package-workspaces.C-K0iRhu.png)_Distribute a package to workspaces_
   
3. Use the search bar to locate specific workspaces, or use filters such as **Tags** or **Installation statuses** to narrow the list.
   
4. Select the workspaces where you plan to install the package.
   
5. Click **Install** to start the distribution process.
   

The package displays a distribution progress banner with a real-time count of completed installations after the process begins. You can close the window at any time without interrupting the distribution.

### Distributions log

The distributions log records all push-based distribution events initiated from the Admin workspace. Each entry captures the following information:

- **Package name**: The distributed package
- **Version**: The version distributed
- **Target workspace(s)**: The tenant workspaces that received the package
- **Timestamp**: The date and time of the distribution event
- **Status**: The outcome of the distribution, such as success, failed, or partial

Curators can use this log as an audit trail to verify deployments and troubleshoot distribution issues.

![Distributions log](/assets/distribution-logs.CwY9SRp3.png)_Distributions log_

## Share a package using links

Curators can generate shareable links to distribute a package to independent, unconnected workspaces. A recipient opens the link and installs the package into their workspace without a direct connection between the two organizations.

Sharing links has the following characteristics:

- You can create multiple links for a single package.
- All active links for a package install the same version. [Changing the version](#change-the-shared-version) updates every active link.
- You can revoke a link at any time.

Links are either public or scoped to a specific workspace:

- **Public**: Anyone with the link can install the package.
- **Workspace-scoped**: Only the workspace that matches the workspace ID you provide can install the package. A scoped link displays **Pending** as the workspace name until the recipient accepts and installs the package.

> **DATA CENTER**
> 
> Sharing links works only between workspaces in the same data center. A link generated from a US workspace is valid only for other US workspaces.

### Generate a sharing link

Complete the following steps to generate a sharing link:

1. Open a package from the XChange dashboard.
   
2. Go to the **Distributions & access** tab, then select **Sharing links**.
   
   ![Sharing links](/assets/sharing-links.C1PGrMCa.png)_Sharing links_
   
3. Click **Generate link**. This opens the **Generate sharing links** dialog.
   
4. Set the link scope using the **Publicly available** toggle:
   
   - Keep **Publicly available** enabled to create a public link that anyone with the link can install. Enter a **Link name** to identify the link in the **Sharing links** table.
   - Disable **Publicly available** to restrict the link to specific workspaces. Add one or more workspace IDs in the **Workspaces** field. Press Enter after each ID, or paste a comma-separated list.
   
   ![Generate sharing links](/assets/generate-sharing-link.BXl4L98N.png)_Generate sharing links_
   
5. Click **Generate link** to create the link.
   
6. Copy the generated link and share it with the recipient workspace.
   

### Manage sharing links

The **Sharing links** view lists all links created for the package. Each row includes the following information:

- **Workspace**: The recipient workspace name, or the workspace ID for a scoped link. Scoped links display **Pending** until the recipient accepts and installs the package.
- **Created**: The date the link was created.
- **Created by**: The user who generated the link.
- **Last installed**: The most recent installation timestamp.
- **Installs**: The total number of installations from the link.
- **Link**: The shareable URL.
- **Active**: A toggle that enables or disables the link.

![Manage sharing links](/assets/manage-sharing-link.nXG2EJQB.png)_Manage sharing links_

Use the **Search by workspace name** field or the **All statuses** and **All creators** filters to find specific links.

To revoke a link, disable the **Active** toggle or delete the link. A revoked link can no longer install the package.

### Change the shared version

All active links for a package install the same version. The **Currently sharing** banner displays the version that active links install.

![Change shared version](/assets/change-shared-version.jFPmvFRC.png)_Change shared version_

Click **Change version** to select a different version. Workato updates all active links to install the new version.

## Settings

The **Settings** tab allows curators to configure governance controls for XChange.

![XChange settings](/assets/xchange-settings.HehC9s4I.png)_XChange settings_

### Auto-approve packages submitted by curators

The **Auto-approve packages submitted by curators** toggle controls whether packages submitted by users with curation rights require review.

- **Enabled**: Submissions from users with curation rights bypass review and are approved automatically.
- **Disabled**: Packages submitted by curators require approval from another curator. Curators can't approve their own submissions.

### Build packages from tenant workspaces

Designated tenant workspaces can author and submit packages to the XChange for curator review. Approved packages are available for distribution exactly as if they were created in the Admin workspace.

### Enable tenant contributions

Curators can enable this feature using the **Allow tenant contributions to XChange** toggle in XChange settings. Users in tenant workspaces can submit packages to this workspace's XChange when enabled.

The **Contributors** table displays all authorized tenant workspaces, including the following information:

- **Customer**: The tenant workspace name
- **Added**: The date the workspace was added as a contributor
- **Number of contributors**: Total users contributing from the workspace
- **Packages submitted**: Number of packages submitted by the workspace

Curators can add or remove contributors to control which tenants can submit packages.

### How it works

The tenant contribution workflow covers workspace authorization, package creation, submission, and distribution.

#### Authorization

Authorized tenant workspaces can assign **Builder** roles to their collaborators and access the XChange in **Builder** view.

#### Package creation

Builders in authorized workspaces can access their own XChange and create packages or new package versions from Dev environment projects using the same flow as in the Admin workspace.

#### Submission

Submitted packages are routed to the curator for review. The submission includes the contributing workspace's name and ID for traceability. Curators can approve or reject the submission. Rejected packages are returned to the builder for revision.

#### Distribution

Approved packages enter the XChange and follow the standard distribution flow. Curators can publish them to the Private Community or distribute them directly to tenant workspaces from the Admin workspace.

## Consumer experience

End users access published packages through the **Community library**, where they can browse, view, and install packages available to their workspace.

The community library supports two key flows:

- **Browse packages**: Search and explore verified packages
- **Install or update packages**: Open a package and install or update versions

### View verified packages in the community library

All published packages appear in the **Verified packages** tab of the Community library.

Complete the following steps to view verified packages in the Community library:

1. Go to **Community library**.
   
2. Click the **Verified packages** tab.
   
3. Browse the list of packages.
   
   ![Browse verified packages](/assets/browse-packages.BiMLvrHY.png)_Browse verified packages_
   
   Each package card displays information such as the package name, description, and the last updated timestamp.
   
   > **STATUS BADGES**
   > 
   > Package cards display status badges to indicate the installation state of each package version.
   > 
   > - **Installed** indicates the latest version is installed
   > - **Update available** indicates a newer version is available
   
4. Use the **Search packages** field to find a package, or click a package to open its details page.
   

### View package details

The package details page displays information about the selected version.

Complete the following steps to view package details:

1. Click a package from the **Verified packages** tab.
   
2. Review the package details page to understand what the version includes:
   
   - **Details**: Includes the description, release notes, and overview
   - **Content**: Includes assets such as recipes, connections, and lookup tables
   
   ![View package details](/assets/view-package-details.D4nO4sqM.png)_View package details_
   
3. Review the panel for information, such as the version information and contents used.
   
4. Click **Install package** to install the version. The page indicates whether the version is **Installed** or if an **Update is available**.
