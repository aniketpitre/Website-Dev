# Configure Asana as a data pipeline source

Set up Asana as a data pipeline source to extract work-management data, such as tasks, projects, portfolios, goals, and their related records, from the Asana REST API and sync it to your destination.

Use this guide to review the features and prerequisites, connect Asana as a data pipeline source, configure the pipeline, and understand the supported objects, sync modes, schema handling, and limitations.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use Asana as a pipeline source:

- **Cloud connectivity**: Connects to the Asana REST API over https. An on-prem agent is not required.
- **Object-level selection**: Choose the supported objects you plan to sync when you configure the pipeline.
- **Sync modes**: The `tasks` object and the objects derived from it sync incrementally. All other objects use full sync.
- **Custom field support**: Workspace-level custom fields sync as dynamic columns on the `tasks`, `projects`, `portfolios`, and `goals` objects.
- **Schema drift detection and handling**: Detect and apply schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or keep the schema fixed with **Block new fields**.
- **Field-level data protection**: Hash or replicate sensitive fields as is before the data reaches your destination.
- **Configurable sync frequency**: Schedule syncs on a time-based interval or with a cron expression. The minimum supported interval is 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following requirements before you configure Asana as a data pipeline source.

- An Asana account with access to the workspaces you plan to sync.
- Permission to authorize a third-party application through the Asana OAuth flow.

> **PLAN AND WORKSPACE REQUIREMENTS**
> 
> Some objects require a specific Asana plan or workspace type. The `portfolios`, `goals`, `portfolio_memberships`, and `goal_relationships` objects require a Business or Enterprise plan. The `teams` and `team_memberships` objects require an organization workspace, which is a workspace tied to a verified email domain. Refer to [Plan and workspace requirements](#plan-and-workspace-requirements) for more information.

## Supported connection types

Asana data pipelines support OAuth 2.0 authentication:

- **OAuth 2.0**: Authorizes Workato to read data from the Asana workspaces your account can access. Asana access tokens are long-lived and don't expire until you revoke them.

## Connect to Asana

Complete the following steps to connect to Asana:

Connect to Asana

1. Select **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `Asana` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name in the **Connection name** field.
   
   ![Connect to Asana](/assets/connect.DeJUsD0Y.png)_Connect to Asana_
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project or folder where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Optional. Use the **Custom OAuth profiles** drop-down menu to select a custom OAuth profile for this connection.
   
6. Click **Connect**.
   
7. Sign in to Asana using your default login method to authorize Workato. Workato displays a success message after Asana authorizes the connection.
   

## Configure the pipeline

Complete the following steps to configure Asana as your data pipeline source:

1. Select **Create > Data pipeline** or press C+I.
   
2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from Asana.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **Asana**.
   
7. Choose the Asana connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel.
   
   ![Add objects](/assets/add-objects-asana.iBAIiLrb.png)_Add objects_
   
9. Search or browse the list of available Asana objects, select the objects you plan to sync, and click **Add**.
   
   > **SYNC MODE IS DETECTED PER OBJECT**
   > 
   > Asana detects the sync mode for each object automatically. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
   
10. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. The pipeline automatically fetches an object's schema when you select it. This ensures the destination matches the source.
    
    Expand an object to view associated fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication.
    
11. Optional. Configure field-level data protection by expanding an object and choosing how to handle each field:
    
    - **Replicate as is**: Data values at the source replicate identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the field before syncing to your destination.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive fields. Refer to [Sensitive data handling](#sensitive-data-handling) for a list of fields that commonly contain PII.
    
12. Click **Add object** again to add more objects. Repeat this step to include additional Asana objects in your pipeline.
    
13. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
    Workato recommends **Auto-sync new fields** for Asana, because admins frequently add custom fields to workspaces.
    
14. Optional. Enter a value in the **Concurrency limit** field to cap the number of concurrent operations. Leave the field blank to use the default quota set by Workato. The maximum value is `100`.
    
15. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from Asana to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    

## Supported objects

Asana data pipelines sync data from the Asana REST API. The following tables list supported objects, grouped by category. Each object syncs as a separate table in your destination.

### Workspaces and people

These objects describe the workspaces the connection can access and the people and tags within them.

| Object | Sync mode | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `workspaces` | Full sync | Top-level container. Required to scope all other objects. |
| `users` | Full sync | Workspace members. Contains PII. |
| `teams` | Full sync | Requires an organization workspace. |
| `team_memberships` | Full sync | Syncs with the parent `teams` object. Requires an organization workspace. |
| `tags` | Full sync | Workspace-level tags. |

### Projects

These objects describe projects and their structure and membership.

| Object | Sync mode | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `projects` | Full sync | Core container for tasks. |
| `sections` | Full sync | Syncs with the parent `projects` object. |
| `project_memberships` | Full sync | Syncs with the parent `projects` object. Maps users to their project access level. |

### Custom fields

These objects describe the custom field definitions in Asana and the projects they're enabled on.

| Object | Sync mode | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `custom_fields` | Full sync | Custom field definitions. |
| `custom_field_settings` | Full sync | Syncs with the parent `projects` object. Maps custom field definitions to the projects they're enabled on. |

### Tasks

These objects describe tasks and the records derived from them. All objects in this category sync as part of the task extraction, so they inherit the incremental behavior of the `tasks` object.

| Object | Sync mode | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tasks` | Incremental | Core work unit. Uses the `modified_at` timestamp as the incremental cursor. Contains PII. |
| `milestones` | Incremental | Syncs as a filtered view of the `tasks` object where the task subtype is a milestone. |
| `stories` | Append-only | Syncs with the parent `tasks` object. Comment and activity history for each task. Contains PII. |
| `task_projects` | Incremental | Syncs with the parent `tasks` object. Maps tasks to their project memberships. |
| `task_sections` | Incremental | Syncs with the parent `tasks` object. Maps tasks to their section within each project. |
| `task_tags` | Incremental | Syncs with the parent `tasks` object. Maps tasks to their tags. |
| `task_followers` | Incremental | Syncs with the parent `tasks` object. Maps tasks to their followers. |
| `task_dependencies` | Incremental | Syncs with the parent `tasks` object. Maps tasks to the tasks they depend on. |

### Portfolios and goals

These objects describe cross-project portfolios and organizational goals. They require a Business or Enterprise plan.

| Object | Sync mode | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `portfolios` | Full sync | Collections of projects. Requires a Business or Enterprise plan. |
| `portfolio_memberships` | Full sync | Syncs with the parent `portfolios` object. Maps portfolios to their projects. |
| `goals` | Full sync | Organizational objectives. Requires a Business or Enterprise plan. |
| `goal_relationships` | Full sync | Syncs with the parent `goals` object. Maps goals to their supporting sub-goals. |

## Sync modes

Asana data pipelines support full sync and incremental sync. Asana detects the sync mode for each object automatically.

### Full sync

Full sync reads all available records for an object on each run. Every object except `tasks` and the objects derived from it uses full sync, including `projects`.

### Incremental sync

Incremental sync reads only the records created or updated since the previous run. The `tasks` object and the objects derived from it sync incrementally. The `stories` object is append-only.

Refer to the [Supported objects](#supported-objects) tables to see the sync mode for each object.

### Delete tracking

Objects that sync in full support delete tracking. The pipeline compares each full sync against the previous run and marks records that no longer exist in Asana with a `_workato_is_deleted` column in your destination.

The `tasks` object and the objects derived from it sync incrementally and don't support delete tracking, because an incremental run reads only the records changed since the previous run and doesn't observe a deletion.

## Schema and data type handling

The connector applies specific handling to certain Asana field types when it replicates data to your destination.

### Rich text fields

Several objects expose both a plain-text field and an HTML-formatted counterpart, such as `notes` and `html_notes` on tasks and projects. Both variants sync as separate columns, because the HTML variant carries formatting the plain-text variant doesn't.

### Custom field columns

Asana workspaces maintain a library of custom field definitions that admins apply to projects. The connector handles custom field values on the `tasks`, `projects`, `portfolios`, and `goals` objects as follows:

- The `custom_fields` column contains a JSON object of all custom field values on the record, whether the field is scoped to the workspace or to an individual project, portfolio, or goal.
- Workspace-scoped custom fields also receive their own column, prefixed with `cf_`, so you can query them directly without unpacking the JSON. Locally-scoped fields appear only in the `custom_fields` JSON. When two locally-scoped fields share the same name, they collide in the JSON object and only the last value is retained.

## Sensitive data handling

Asana objects can contain personally identifiable information (PII). The following objects commonly contain sensitive fields:

| Object | Sensitive fields |
| --- | --- |
| `users` | `name`, `email`, `photo` |
| `tasks` | `name`, `notes`, `html_notes` |
| `stories` | `text`, `html_text` |
| `projects` | `name`, `notes`, `html_notes` |

The `notes` and `html_notes` fields on tasks and projects are free-text and carry the highest risk, because users can enter phone numbers, addresses, or other personal data in descriptions. Custom fields of the people type also reference user records that include names and email addresses.

Use the **Hash** option in field-level data protection during pipeline configuration to protect PII before it reaches your destination. Refer to the [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) steps for more information.

Workato recommends hashing user email addresses and free-text description fields for pipelines operating under GDPR or CCPA.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use Asana as a data pipeline source:

### Incremental sync is limited to tasks

Only the `tasks` object and the objects derived from it sync incrementally. All other objects, including `projects`, re-fetch their full record set on every run. Account for the full re-fetch when you set the sync frequency for large non-task objects.

### Container read quota

Asana limits API reads to approximately 50,000 items within a single container, such as the tasks in a project or section. The quota applies to all objects, but you're most likely to reach it with `tasks` and their related objects. If a container exceeds the quota, Asana returns an error and the sync for that object fails.

The pipeline reduces the risk by reading tasks per section rather than per project, but a single section that holds more than 50,000 tasks still fails. The count includes completed tasks, because the pipeline extracts tasks regardless of completion status. Keep the number of tasks in any one section below this quota to avoid sync failures.

Refer to the Asana [API quotas documentation](https://developers.asana.com/docs/errors#api-limits) for more information.

### Plan and workspace requirements

Certain objects require a specific Asana plan or workspace type:

| Object | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `portfolios`, `portfolio_memberships`, `goals`, `goal_relationships` | Business or Enterprise plan |
| `teams`, `team_memberships` | Organization workspace (tied to a verified email domain) |

Select only the objects your plan and workspace support. If you select a `portfolio_memberships`, `goal_relationships`, or `team_memberships` object without the required plan or workspace type, the sync fails with an error.

### Minimum sync frequency

The minimum supported sync interval is 15 minutes.
