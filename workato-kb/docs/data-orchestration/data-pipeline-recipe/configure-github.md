# Configure GitHub as a data pipeline source

Set up GitHub as a data pipeline source to extract repositories, issues, pull requests, commits, and related development records from the GitHub REST and GraphQL APIs and sync them to your destination.

Use this guide to review the features and prerequisites, connect GitHub as a data pipeline source, configure the pipeline, and understand the supported objects, sync modes, schema handling, sensitive data handling, and limitations.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use GitHub as a pipeline source:

- **Cloud and self-hosted connectivity**: Connect to GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Cloud over https. Route the connection through an on-prem agent to connect to a self-hosted GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
- **Organization-scoped syncing**: Select one or more GitHub organizations when you configure the pipeline. Workato syncs every repository in those organizations that your connection can access.
- **Object-level selection**: Select the objects you plan to sync as separate tables in your destination. Refer to [Supported objects](#supported-objects) for the full list.
- **Full sync and incremental sync**: The `Issue`, `IssueComment`, `Commit`, and `ReviewComment` objects support incremental sync using GitHub's `since` parameter. Every other object syncs in full on each run. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
- **Delete tracking**: Workato compares each full sync against the previous run and marks records that no longer exist in GitHub as deleted in your destination.
- **Schema drift detection and handling**: Detect and apply schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or keep the schema fixed with **Block new fields**.
- **Field-level data protection**: Hash or replicate sensitive fields as is before the data reaches your destination.
- **Configurable sync frequency**: Schedule syncs on a time-based interval or with a cron expression. The minimum supported interval is 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Connecting GitHub as a data pipeline source requires:

- A GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, or GitHub Enterprise Server account with access to the organizations and repositories you plan to sync
- One or more GitHub organization logins to scope the pipeline to
- An on-premises agent, if you connect to a self-hosted GitHub Enterprise Server instance
- Credentials for your chosen authentication method:
  - **OAuth App**: A GitHub account with permission to authorize Workato's registered OAuth App
  - **Personal access token**: A classic or fine-grained personal access token generated from your GitHub account

## Required permissions

Grant only the read-level permissions needed to sync your selected objects:

| GitHub permission category | Classic OAuth App / personal access token scope | Fine-grained personal access token permission | Workato objects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Repository contents and metadata | `repo` | Contents: Read-only, Metadata: Read-only | `Repository`, `Branch`, `BranchCommitRelation`, `Tag`, `Commit`, `CommitComment`, `CommitFile`, `RepositoryTopic`, `RepositoryLanguage` |
| Issues | `repo` | Issues: Read-only | `Issue`, `IssueComment`, `IssueLabel`, `IssueAssignee`, `IssueEvent`, `Label`, `Milestone` |
| Pull requests | `repo` | Pull requests: Read-only | `PullRequest`, `PullRequestCommit`, `PullRequestReview`, `ReviewComment`, `RequestedReviewerHistory` |
| Actions | `repo` | Actions: Read-only | `Workflow`, `WorkflowRun`, `WorkflowRunJob`, `CommitStatus` |
| Actions check runs | `repo` | Actions: Read-only, plus Checks: Read-only | `CommitCheckRun` |
| Deployments | `repo` | Deployments: Read-only | `Deployment`, `DeploymentStatus` |
| Organization members and teams | `read:org` | Members: Read-only (organization level) | `Team`, `TeamMember`, `RepositoryTeam`, `User`, `Collaborator` |
| Account identity | `read:user` | Not applicable | Required for the connection check only |
| Dependabot alerts | `security_events` | Dependabot alerts: Read-only | `SecurityAlert` |

> **DON'T GRANT THE WORKFLOW SCOPE**
> 
> The `workflow` scope authorizes writing to Actions workflow files. A data pipeline connection only reads data and doesn't need this scope.

## Supported connection types

GitHub data pipelines support two authentication methods:

- **OAuth App**: Authorize Workato's registered GitHub OAuth App through the standard browser redirect flow. OAuth tokens are long-lived and don't expire unless you revoke the authorization or the OAuth App is deleted.
- **Personal access token**: Provide a classic or fine-grained personal access token generated from your GitHub account. Workato recommends this method for server-to-server setups where an interactive OAuth flow isn't practical.

## Connect to GitHub

Complete the following steps to connect GitHub as a data pipeline source:

Connect to GitHub

1. Sign in to your Workato account and go to the project where you plan to add your GitHub connection.
   
2. Click **Create > Connection** (or press C twice), then select **GitHub** as your connection.
   
3. Provide a **Connection name** that identifies which GitHub instance Workato is connected to.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Use the **Authentication type** drop-down menu and select **Personal Access Token**.
   
6. Optional. Click **Advanced configuration** to display the **Host name** field.
   
7. Optional. Enter a **Host name**. This is applicable when using Github Enterprise Server. Enter your Github subdomain. For example, if your host URL is `https://github.example-organisation.com`, your subdomain is `github.example-organisation.com`.
   
8. Enter your **Personal Access Token**.
   
9. Optional. Enter a **Custom OAuth profile**. This ensures all requests to the app use the specified profile.
   
10. Click **Connect**.
    

## Configure the pipeline

Complete the following steps to configure GitHub as your data pipeline source:

1. Select **Create > Data pipeline** or press C+I.
   
2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from GitHub.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **GitHub**.
   
7. Choose the GitHub connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Enter one or more GitHub organization logins, separated by commas, in the **Organizations** field. Workato syncs only the repositories in these organizations that your connection can access, and doesn't expand the scope beyond the organizations you enter here.
   
9. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel.
   
   ![Add objects](/assets/add-objects-github.DX63BIep.png)_Add objects_
   
10. Search or browse the list of available GitHub objects, select the objects to sync, and click **Add**.
    
    > **HIGH-VOLUME OBJECTS**
    > 
    > The `CommitFile` and `BranchCommitRelation` objects re-read commit-level data in full on every sync and can generate a very large number of rows for repositories with long commit histories. Refer to [High-volume objects require careful sync planning](#high-volume-objects-require-careful-sync-planning) before you add either object.
    
11. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. The pipeline automatically fetches an object's schema when you select it. This ensures the destination matches the source.
    
    Expand an object to view associated fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication.
    
12. Optional. Configure field-level data protection by expanding an object and choosing how to handle each field:
    
    - **Replicate as is**: Data values at the source replicate identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the field before syncing to your destination.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive fields. Refer to [Sensitive data handling](#sensitive-data-handling) for a list of fields that commonly contain PII.
    
13. Click **Add object** again to add more objects. Repeat this step to include additional GitHub objects in your pipeline.
    
14. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
15. Optional. Enter a value in the **Concurrency limit** field to cap the number of concurrent operations. Leave the field blank to use the default quota set by Workato. The maximum value is `100`.
    
16. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from GitHub to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    

## Supported objects

GitHub data pipelines sync data from the GitHub REST API, and from the GraphQL API for pull request reviews and releases. The following tables list the supported objects, grouped by category. Each object syncs as a separate table in your destination:

### Organizations, repositories, and access

| Object | Sync modes | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Repository` | Full sync | Yes |
| `Team` | Full sync | Yes |
| `TeamMember` | Syncs with the parent `Team` object | Yes |
| `RepositoryTeam` | Full sync | Yes |
| `User` | Full sync | Yes |
| `Collaborator` | Full sync | Yes |

### Issues and pull requests

GitHub returns issues and pull requests from the same endpoint. Workato distinguishes them by checking for a `pull_request` field on each record, so the `Issue` object excludes any row shaped like a pull request:

| Object | Sync modes | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Issue` | Full sync, incremental | No |
| `IssueComment` | Full sync, incremental | No |
| `IssueLabel` | Syncs with the parent `Issue` object | No |
| `IssueAssignee` | Syncs with the parent `Issue` object | No |
| `IssueEvent` | Full sync | Yes |
| `Label` | Full sync | Yes |
| `Milestone` | Full sync | Yes |
| `PullRequest` | Full sync | Yes |
| `PullRequestCommit` | Syncs with the parent `PullRequest` object | Yes |
| `PullRequestReview` | Syncs with the parent `PullRequest` object | Yes |
| `ReviewComment` | Full sync, incremental | No |
| `RequestedReviewerHistory` | Syncs with the parent `PullRequest` object | Yes |

### Commits and repository content

| Object | Sync modes | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Commit` | Full sync, incremental | No |
| `CommitComment` | Full sync | Yes |
| `CommitStatus` | Syncs with the parent `Commit` object | No |
| `CommitCheckRun` | Syncs with the parent `Commit` object | No |
| `Branch` | Full sync | Yes |
| `BranchCommitRelation` | Syncs with the parent `Branch` object | Yes |
| `Tag` | Full sync | Yes |
| `RepositoryTopic` | Syncs with the parent `Repository` object | Yes |
| `RepositoryLanguage` | Syncs with the parent `Repository` object | Yes |
| `CommitFile` | Syncs with the parent `Commit` object | No |

`CommitFile` and `BranchCommitRelation` are opt-in, high-volume objects. Refer to [High-volume objects require careful sync planning](#high-volume-objects-require-careful-sync-planning) before you add either object.

### CI/CD and releases

| Object | Sync modes | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Workflow` | Full sync | Yes |
| `WorkflowRun` | Full sync | Yes |
| `WorkflowRunJob` | Syncs with the parent `WorkflowRun` object | Yes |
| `Deployment` | Full sync | Yes |
| `DeploymentStatus` | Syncs with the parent `Deployment` object | Yes |
| `Release` | Syncs with the parent `Repository` object | Yes |

### Engagement and security

| Object | Sync modes | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Stargazer` | Full sync | Yes |
| `SecurityAlert` | Full sync | Yes |

`SecurityAlert` requires Dependabot to be enabled on the repository and the appropriate permission granted to your connection. Refer to [Dependabot alerts require repository and permission setup](#dependabot-alerts-require-repository-and-permission-setup) for more information.

## Sync modes

GitHub data pipelines support full sync and incremental sync. Refer to [Supported objects](#supported-objects) to see the sync mode for each object.

### Full sync

A full sync reads all available records from GitHub for the selected object on every run and overwrites the destination table.

### Incremental sync

An incremental sync extracts only records GitHub reports as created or updated since the last successful run, using GitHub's `since` parameter as the cursor. Only `Issue`, `IssueComment`, `Commit`, and `ReviewComment` support incremental sync. Every other object, including objects that sync alongside a parent object such as `IssueLabel` or `WorkflowRunJob`, syncs in full.

### Delete tracking

Workato compares each full sync against the previous run and marks records that no longer exist in GitHub as deleted in your destination. This applies to every full-sync object.

GitHub's `since` parameter doesn't report deletions, so `Issue`, `IssueComment`, `Commit`, and `ReviewComment` don't track deletes during incremental sync. A record deleted in GitHub remains in your destination for these objects until you run a full sync. Refer to [Incremental objects do not track deletions](#incremental-objects-do-not-track-deletions) for more information.

## Schema and data type handling

The following considerations apply to schema and data types when you sync data from GitHub:

### Nested fields

GitHub responses include nested objects and arrays, such as the `base` and `head` branch references on a pull request or the raw `commit` metadata on a commit. Workato stores these as JSON columns rather than flattening them into individual columns.

Workato syncs JSON fields to the destination's native JSON type, such as `VARIANT` in Snowflake. Workato serializes JSON fields as strings if the destination doesn't support a native JSON type.

### Custom properties are not synced

GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server support repository-level custom properties. Workato doesn't sync custom properties in this release. Only the standard fields listed for each object are available.

## Sensitive data handling

GitHub objects can contain personally identifiable information (PII). The following objects commonly contain sensitive fields:

| Object | Sensitive fields |
| --- | --- |
| `Commit` | `commit.author.name`, `commit.author.email`, `commit.committer.name`, `commit.committer.email` |
| `Issue` | `user.login`, `body`, `assignees` |
| `IssueComment` | `user.login`, `body` |
| `PullRequest` | `user.login`, `body`, `head.label`, `merge_commit_sha` |
| `ReviewComment` | `user.login`, `body` |
| `User` | `login`, `name`, `email`, `avatar_url` |
| `Collaborator` | `login`, `email` |

The `body` field on `Issue`, `IssueComment`, `PullRequest`, and `ReviewComment` is free text. Contributors can paste account information, credentials, or other customer data into issue descriptions, pull request descriptions, and comments, so these fields carry the highest risk.

Use the **Hash** option in field-level data protection during pipeline configuration to protect PII before it reaches your destination. Refer to the [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) steps for more information.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use GitHub as a data pipeline source:

### Incremental objects do not track deletions

`Issue`, `IssueComment`, `Commit`, and `ReviewComment` sync incrementally using GitHub's `since` parameter, which doesn't report deletions. A record deleted in GitHub remains in your destination for these objects until you run a full sync. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information.

### You can't filter to specific repositories

The pipeline syncs every repository within your selected organizations that your connection can access. You can't include or exclude individual repositories. Personal repositories that don't belong to an organization aren't synced.

### High-volume objects require careful sync planning

The `CommitFile` and `BranchCommitRelation` objects can generate a high volume of records. `CommitFile` requires one API call per commit to retrieve file-level diff data, with no bulk endpoint available.

### Dependabot alerts require repository and permission setup

The `SecurityAlert` object syncs Dependabot security alerts. It returns no rows for repositories where Dependabot is disabled, and the sync fails for that object if your connection lacks the required permission. Refer to [Required permissions](#required-permissions) for the scope you need to grant.

### GitHub Enterprise Server version differences

GitHub Enterprise Server can run several versions behind GitHub.com. Some objects and fields available on GitHub.com may not be available on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance until you upgrade.

### Minimum sync frequency

The minimum supported sync interval is 15 minutes.
