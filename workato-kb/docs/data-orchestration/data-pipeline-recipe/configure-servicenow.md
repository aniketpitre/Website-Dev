# Configure ServiceNow as a data pipeline source

Set up ServiceNow as a data pipeline source to extract and sync records into your destination. This guide includes connection setup, pipeline configuration, supported objects, sync behavior, and known limitations.

Workato uses the [ServiceNow REST Table API v2](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/api-reference/rest-apis/c_TableAPI.html) to extract and sync data from any accessible ServiceNow table, including standard ITSM tables, CMDB tables, and custom tables.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use ServiceNow as a data pipeline source:

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Standard, CMDB, and custom table extraction | Sync any table accessible by your service account, including custom (`u_*`) and application-scoped (`x_*`) tables. Refer to [Supported objects](#supported-objects). |
| Full and incremental sync | Supports incremental sync through `sys_updated_on`, append-only incremental through `sys_created_on`, and full refresh for tables without timestamp columns. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes). |
| Delete tracking | Detects deleted records through the `sys_audit_delete` system table and sets a soft-delete flag in the destination. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking). |
| Class Table Inheritance (CTI) | Syncs parent table columns to child tables in inherited columns mode to provide complete records without duplication. Refer to [Class Table Inheritance](#class-table-inheritance). |
| Field-level selection | Select or deselect individual fields per table to control which data the pipeline extracts. |
| Schema drift detection and handling | Detects and applies schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or blocks changes for manual review. Refer to [Schema drift](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift). |
| Field-level data masking | Apply hash-based masking to sensitive fields during pipeline configuration. Refer to [PII and sensitive data](#pii-and-sensitive-data). |

## Prerequisites

Complete the following requirements before you connect ServiceNow as a data pipeline source.

### ServiceNow instance requirements

- A ServiceNow instance running the Istanbul release or later (required for OAuth 2.0 authentication).
- The OAuth 2.0 plugin (`com.snc.platform.security.oauth`) activated on the instance if you plan to use OAuth authentication. Contact your ServiceNow administrator to verify activation.
- An OAuth API endpoint for external clients registered in **Application Registry** if you plan to use OAuth authentication. Refer to [Register an OAuth application in ServiceNow](#register-an-oauth-application-in-servicenow) for setup steps.

### Service account requirements

Create a dedicated service account for the data pipeline. The account must have REST API access enabled, and the account timezone must be set to UTC to ensure consistent timestamp handling across all synced records.

### Roles and permissions

The service account must have **read access** to the following system tables for the connector to function:

| Table | Operation | Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tables | read | `sys_db_object`, `sys_db_object.*` | Lists all tables in your instance. Used for dynamic schema discovery. Required for connection check. |
| Dictionary entry | read | `sys_dictionary`, `sys_dictionary.*` | Provides field definitions, data types, and reference targets. Used to build table schemas. Required for connection check. |
| Table rotation | read | `sys_table_rotation` | Optional. Identifies rotated tables that use `sys_created_on` as the incremental sync cursor. The connector degrades gracefully if this table is unreadable. |
| Audit delete | read | `sys_audit_delete` | Logs deleted records. Required for delete tracking. If unreadable, delete tracking is unavailable for all objects. |

The service account must also have read access to every table you plan to sync in the pipeline.

Some base system roles, such as **admin**, include access to all of these tables. Refer to the ServiceNow [Base system roles](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-platform-administration/page/administer/roles/reference/r_BaseSystemRoles.html) page for more information. [Create a custom role](#create-a-custom-role) with the minimum required access if you don't plan to use a base system role.

### Create a custom role

Create a custom role with the minimum access the data pipeline requires if your organization doesn't allow broad admin access for integration accounts.

1. Create a role in your ServiceNow instance and assign it a name that reflects its association with the data pipeline, such as `Workato Pipeline`. Refer to the ServiceNow documentation for more information on [creating roles](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-platform-administration/page/administer/roles/task/t_CreateARole.html).
   
2. Assign the following access control rules to the role:
   
   | Table | Type | Operation | Name |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | Tables | record | read | `sys_db_object`, `sys_db_object.*` |
   | Dictionary entry | record | read | `sys_dictionary`, `sys_dictionary.*` |
   | Table rotation | record | read | `sys_table_rotation` (optional — enables rotated table detection) |
   | Audit delete | record | read | `sys_audit_delete` (enables delete tracking) |
   
   > **SECURITY ADMIN ROLE REQUIRED**
   > 
   > Only a user with the `security_admin` role can create or edit access control rules. Confirm your permissions with your ServiceNow administrator. Refer to the ServiceNow documentation on [elevated privilege roles](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-platform-security/page/administer/security/concept/c_ElevatedPrivilege.html) for more information.
   
3. Add read access control rules for every ServiceNow table you plan to sync in the pipeline. For example, to sync incidents, add a read rule for the `incident` table.
   
4. Assign the custom role to the service account you plan to use for the data pipeline connection.
   

> **CREATE INDEX**
> 
> Create an index on the `sys_updated_on` column for any large table you plan to sync incrementally. This improves query performance during extraction. Contact your ServiceNow administrator to add the index.

## Supported connection types

Workato supports the following authentication methods for ServiceNow data pipelines:

- Username/Password: Connect with your ServiceNow login credentials. No OAuth configuration required.
- OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Grant): Recommended for production use. Requires the OAuth 2.0 plugin on your instance. You authenticate through a browser-based flow and Workato manages token refresh automatically.
- OAuth 2.0 (Password Grant): Alternative OAuth flow for service accounts and headless integrations. You provide your Client ID, Client secret, Username, and Password directly. Suitable when interactive browser authentication is impractical.

The OAuth methods require you to register an OAuth application in ServiceNow and provide the Client ID and Client secret during connection setup. Username/Password authentication does not require OAuth configuration.

## Register an OAuth application in ServiceNow

Create an OAuth API endpoint for external clients in your ServiceNow instance before you connect to Workato. Refer to the [ServiceNow OAuth setup documentation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/yokohama-api-reference/page/integrate/inbound-rest/concept/c_OAuthToken.html) for detailed instructions.

Set the **Redirect URL** to `https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback` when you register the application.

After you register the application, copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret** values from the application record. Store these securely. You must provide them during Workato connection setup.

> **INVALID REFRESH TOKEN ERROR**
> 
> You may see an `invalid_request` or `invalid refresh token` error when your ServiceNow OAuth 2.0 connection expires. This behavior occurs because ServiceNow limits how long a refresh token remains valid. You must reauthenticate the connection when the token expires.
> 
> You can adjust the **Refresh Token Lifetime** in your ServiceNow OAuth client configuration. Go to your ServiceNow instance, open **System OAuth > Application Registry**, select your Workato OAuth client, and review the **Refresh Token Lifetime** value. The default duration is **100 days**. Access tokens expire after **30 minutes** by default. Workato handles access token refresh automatically, but you must reauthorize the connection manually when the refresh token expires.

10. Click **Connect**.
    

## Configure the pipeline

Complete the following steps to configure ServiceNow as your data pipeline source:

1. Select **Create > Data pipeline** or press C+I.
   
2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from the source application.
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **ServiceNow**.
   
7. Choose the ServiceNow connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
   ![Choose a ServiceNow connection](/assets/choose-servicenow-connection.Bn2HVNxl.png)_Choose a ServiceNow connection_
   
8. Use the **Inherited columns** drop-down menu to configure how the pipeline handles Class Table Inheritance (CTI). Select **Include inherited columns** to merge parent table fields into child table schemas, or select **Exclude inherited columns** to include only fields defined directly on each table. Refer to [Class Table Inheritance](#class-table-inheritance) for more information.
   
9. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel. Workato dynamically discovers all tables accessible by your service account and displays them as a searchable list. Each table displays its label and table name.
   
   ![Add object](/assets/add-object-servicenow.5TlWiRlJ.png)_Add object_
   
10. Search or browse the list of available ServiceNow tables. Select the tables you plan to sync and click **Add**.
    
    ![Add new objects](/assets/add-new-objects-servicenow.CDpQMvjc.png)_Add new objects_
    
    > **FULL REFRESH OBJECTS**
    > 
    > Objects that lack a `sys_updated_on` or `sys_created_on` column require a full refresh on each sync run.
    
11. Review and customize the schema for each selected table. Expand any table to view its fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication. Use the masking option on individual fields to apply hash-based masking to sensitive data.
    
12. Click **Add object** again to add more tables. Repeat this step to include multiple ServiceNow tables in your pipeline.
    
13. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
    Workato recommends **Auto-sync new fields** because ServiceNow instances frequently add custom columns.
    
14. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from ServiceNow to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    

## Supported objects

ServiceNow stores all data in tables accessible through the REST Table API. The pipeline supports syncing any table accessible by your service account. This includes standard ITSM tables, CMDB tables, HR tables, custom tables, and application-scoped tables. A typical ServiceNow instance exposes over 1,000 tables, though the exact number varies based on the modules installed.

Workato dynamically discovers available tables at connection setup time by querying ServiceNow system dictionary tables (`sys_db_object`, `sys_dictionary`).

If you don't see a specific table in the object wizard, verify that your service account has read access to that table and that the related ServiceNow module is installed on your instance.

The following tables list commonly synced ServiceNow objects. All custom objects (`u_*` prefix) and application-scoped objects (`x_*` prefix) are also supported through dynamic schema discovery.

### ITSM and task management

The following objects support IT service management workflows, including incident, problem, and change management. Objects marked "Extends `task`" inherit columns from the `task` parent table through Class Table Inheritance.

| `metric_instance` | Incremental | `sys_updated_on` | Metric tracking instances for SLA and OLA measurements. High volume. |

### System and audit tables

The following table stores system-level data, including activity logs, email records, and audit trails.

> **HIGH-VOLUME SYSTEM OBJECTS**
> 
> The objects in this group aren't excluded from the object wizard. They appear alongside all other discoverable objects. However, syncing these objects dramatically increases sync duration and API usage.

These tables tend to have very high record volumes and may significantly increase sync duration and API usage.

| Object | Sync mode | Incremental key | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sys_journal_field` | Incremental (append-only) | `sys_created_on` | Work notes and comments across all tables. Very high volume. Available but not recommended for most pipelines. |
| `sys_email` | Incremental (append-only) | `sys_created_on` | Email records. Contains PII. Available but not recommended for most pipelines. |
| `sys_audit` | Incremental (append-only) | `sys_created_on` | Field-level audit trail. Extremely high volume. Not recommended for sync unless required for compliance. |
| `sys_audit_delete` | Incremental (append-only) | `sys_created_on` | Delete audit trail. Used internally by the connector for delete tracking. Not recommended for sync to destination. |

### Custom and application-scoped tables

All custom tables (tables with the `u_` prefix) and application-scoped tables (tables with the `x_` prefix) are discoverable. Workato determines the sync mode for each custom table automatically based on whether `sys_updated_on` or `sys_created_on` columns exist.

## Sync modes

ServiceNow data pipelines support incremental sync, full refresh, and delete tracking. The connector determines the sync mode for each object automatically based on the columns available in the source table.

### Incremental sync

An incremental sync extracts only new and updated records on each pipeline run. Most ServiceNow objects use the `sys_updated_on` column as the incremental sync key.

Objects with `sys_created_on` but not `sys_updated_on` support append-only incremental sync. The pipeline captures new records but does not detect updates to existing records. The `sys_journal_field` and `sys_email` objects use this mode because their records are immutable after creation.

### Full refresh

A full refresh extracts all records from the source object on every pipeline run, ordered by `sys_id`. Use full refresh for objects that lack both `sys_updated_on` and `sys_created_on` columns. The connector assigns this mode automatically.

### Rotated tables

ServiceNow uses table rotation for high-volume system tables. The pipeline detects rotated tables through the `sys_table_rotation` system table and uses `sys_created_on` as the incremental sync cursor instead of `sys_updated_on`, because rotated records are immutable after creation.

### Delete tracking

Delete tracking detects records deleted from the source and emits a delete marker row in the destination. This mode is available for objects that use `sys_updated_on` as their incremental sync key. Rotated and append-only objects don't support delete tracking in this release.

Each delete marker row contains `sys_id`, `_workato_is_deleted` set to `true`, and `sys_updated_on` set to the deletion timestamp. All other fields are null. Delete tracking requires the service account to have read access to `sys_audit_delete`.

## Class Table Inheritance

ServiceNow uses Class Table Inheritance (CTI) where child tables extend parent tables. For example, the `incident`, `problem`, and `change_request` tables all extend the `task` parent table. A record in `incident` also exists in `task`.

### Inherited columns mode

The pipeline syncs parent table columns to child tables so each child table contains the complete record when inherited columns mode is enabled. Records that belong to child tables are excluded from the parent table to prevent data duplication. The `sys_class_name` field on each record identifies which child table it belongs to.

Child tables contain only their own columns when inherited columns mode is disabled. The parent table contains all records, including those from child tables, when inherited columns mode is disabled. This results in partial records in child tables and duplicate records across parent and child tables.

Key inheritance hierarchies include the following:

- `task` is the parent of `incident`, `problem`, `change_request`, `sc_request`, `sc_req_item`, `sc_task`, `sn_hr_core_case`
- `cmdb_ci` is the parent of `cmdb_ci_server`, `cmdb_ci_computer`, `cmdb_ci_service`, `cmdb_ci_app_server`, `cmdb_ci_database`
- `alm_asset` is the parent of `alm_hardware`, `alm_consumable`, `alm_license`

## Limitations

Review the following limitations when you configure a ServiceNow data pipeline:

### Null `sys_id` records

ServiceNow tables occasionally contain records where `sys_id` is null. This can occur when records are corrupt or when row-level ACL policies prevent the service account from reading a specific record. The pipeline skips null `sys_id` records during extraction and doesn't load them to the destination. If you notice missing records, verify that your service account has the appropriate ACL permissions for the affected table.

### `sys_updated_on` isn't updated on all modifications

The `sys_updated_on` field isn't guaranteed to update on every record modification. XML imports, direct database operations, bulk API operations, and import sets that skip business rules may bypass this field. Records modified through these paths may not appear in incremental syncs. Run a full refresh to re-extract all data for the affected objects if you suspect missing records.

### File attachments not supported

The pipeline extracts structured table data only. File attachments aren't supported in this release.

## PII and sensitive data

ServiceNow tables contain personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive data. The following table identifies key objects and fields that may require field-level data masking.

| Object | Sensitive fields |
| --- | --- |
| `sys_user` | `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `phone`, `mobile_phone`, `home_phone`, `street`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, `country`, `employee_number`, `manager` |
| `incident` | `description`, `close_notes`, `comments_and_work_notes` (may contain PII in free-text fields), `caller_id` |
| `sys_journal_field` | `value` |
| `sn_hr_core_case` | `subject_person`, `description` (HR case details containing sensitive employment data) |
| `sys_email` | `from`, `recipients`, `subject`, `body` |
| `cmdb_ci` | `ip_address`, `mac_address`, `serial_number`, `asset_tag` |
