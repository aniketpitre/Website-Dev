# Configure Apollo.io as a data pipeline source

Set up Apollo.io as a data pipeline source to extract contact, account, deal, and sales engagement records into your destination.

Use this guide to generate an Apollo.io API key, set up a connection, configure your pipeline, add objects, review sync behavior, and understand known limitations.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use Apollo.io as a pipeline source:

- **Cloud connectivity**: Connect to Apollo.io over HTTPS through `https://api.apollo.io`. On-prem agents aren't required.
- **Full sync and incremental sync**: Supports full sync and incremental sync modes. Incremental sync uses a timestamp cursor on `contacts` and a daily date cursor on `analytics_report`. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
- **Object-level selection**: Select Apollo.io objects to sync as separate tables in your destination. Refer to [Supported objects](#supported-objects) for the full list.
- **Custom field auto-sync**: Automatically detect and sync custom fields you've added to `accounts`, `contacts`, `deals`, and `users`, labeled by their Apollo.io field name.
- **Schema drift detection and handling**: Detect and apply schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or keep the schema fixed with **Block new fields**.
- **Field-level data protection**: Hash or replicate sensitive fields as is before the data reaches your destination.
- **Configurable sync frequency**: Schedule syncs on a time-based interval or with a cron expression. The minimum supported interval is 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Connecting Apollo.io as a data pipeline source requires:

- An Apollo.io account with API access for your plan.
- An Apollo.io API key. Refer to [Generate an Apollo.io API key](#generate-an-apolloio-api-key) for setup steps.

> **REQUIRED PERMISSIONS**
> 
> Apollo.io API keys come in two types. A master key unlocks every supported object. A scoped key only unlocks the endpoints you granted it access to when you created it. Use a master key, or a scoped key granted access to every endpoint the objects you plan to sync require, to avoid permissions errors.

## Generate an Apollo.io API key

Generate the API key in your Apollo.io account before you create the connection in Workato.

Refer to Apollo.io's [Create an API key](https://docs.apollo.io/docs/create-api-key) documentation for setup steps.

> **USE A MASTER KEY FOR FULL OBJECT COVERAGE**
> 
> A scoped key only reaches the endpoints you granted it access to. Copy a master key instead, or grant your scoped key access to every endpoint the objects you plan to sync require.

## Supported connection types

Apollo.io data pipelines support one authentication method:

- **API key**: Provide an Apollo.io API key. Refer to [Generate an Apollo.io API key](#generate-an-apolloio-api-key) for setup steps.

## Connect to Apollo.io

Complete the following steps to connect to Apollo.io:

Connect to Apollo.io

1. Select **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `Apollo.io` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name in the **Connection name** field.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Paste the key you generated into the **API key** field. Workato sends this value to Apollo.io as the `x-api-key` request header. A master key unlocks every supported object. A scoped key only unlocks the endpoints you granted it access to.
   
6. Select **Connect** to verify and save the connection. Workato displays a success message when the connection is established.
   

## Configure the pipeline

Complete the following steps to configure Apollo.io as your data pipeline source:

1. Select **Create > Data pipeline**.
   
2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from Apollo.io.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **Apollo.io**.
   
7. Choose the Apollo.io connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel.
   
   ![Add objects](/assets/add-objects-apollo.CGaDBGEZ.png)_Add objects_
   
9. Search or browse the list of available Apollo.io objects, select the objects you plan to sync, and click **Add**.
   
   > **FULL SYNC FOR MOST OBJECTS**
   > 
   > Only `contacts` and `analytics_report` support incremental sync. Every other object uses full sync, because Apollo.io doesn't expose an update-tracking cursor for them.
   
10. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. The pipeline automatically fetches an object's schema when you select it. This ensures the destination matches the source.
    
    Expand an object to view associated fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication.
    
11. Optional. Configure field-level data protection by expanding an object and choosing how to handle each field:
    
    - **Replicate as is**: Data values at the source replicate identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the field before syncing to your destination.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive fields. Refer to [Sensitive data handling](#sensitive-data-handling) for a list of fields that commonly contain PII.
    
12. Click **Add object** again to add more objects. Repeat these steps to include additional Apollo.io objects in your pipeline.
    
13. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually.
14. Optional. Enter a value in the **Concurrency limit** field to cap the number of concurrent operations. Apollo.io pipelines run at no more than `2` concurrent operations regardless of the value you enter here.
    
15. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from Apollo.io to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter **6** in the **Trigger every** field. The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline retrieves all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       This setting seeds the starting point for `contacts` and `analytics_report` on their first incremental run only. Later runs continue from where the previous run left off, regardless of this setting. For `calls`, `conversations`, and `outreach_emails`, this setting bounds every run, not just the first, because these three objects don't persist a cursor between runs. Every other object syncs its complete history on each full sync run, regardless of this setting.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes. For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       This setting only affects `calls`, `conversations`, `outreach_emails`, and `analytics_report`. Every other object syncs its complete history on each full sync run, regardless of this setting.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    

## Supported objects

Apollo.io data pipelines sync data from the Apollo.io REST API. The following tables list the supported objects, grouped by category. Each object syncs as a separate table in your destination:

### Core CRM records

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `contacts` | Incremental | No | N/A |
| `accounts` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) | N/A |
| `deals` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) | N/A |

### Sales engagement

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sequences` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) | N/A |
| `tasks` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) | N/A |
| `calls` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) | Bounded to the historical start date through the sync's start time. |
| `conversations` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) | Bounded to the historical start date through the sync's start time. Doesn't include full call transcripts. |
| `outreach_emails` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) | Bounded to the historical start date through the sync's start time. |
| `notes` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) | Sync time scales with your total contact count. |
| `email_accounts` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) | N/A |

### Reference tables

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contact_stages` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) |
| `deal_stages` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) |
| `account_stages` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) |
| `lists` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) |

### Team and reporting

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `users` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) | N/A |
| `analytics_report` | Incremental | No | Syncs only the daily count of emails sent (`num_emails_sent`), grouped by day. Refer to [Limitations](#limitations). |

## Sync modes

Apollo.io data pipelines support full sync and incremental sync. Each object uses the sync mode listed in the [Supported objects](#supported-objects) tables. You can't switch an individual object to the other mode.

### Full sync

A full sync reads all available records from Apollo.io for the selected object and overwrites the destination table. Every object except `contacts` and `analytics_report` uses full sync, because Apollo.io doesn't expose an update-tracking cursor for them. `accounts`, `calls`, `conversations`, and `outreach_emails` only include a creation or occurrence timestamp, which confirms new records but can't detect edits to records Workato already synced.

### Incremental sync

An incremental sync extracts only records that changed since the last successful run. `contacts` uses its last-updated timestamp as the incremental cursor. `analytics_report` re-pulls the trailing `2` days of data on every run to capture late-finalizing metrics, in addition to any new days since the last run.

Refer to the [Supported objects](#supported-objects) tables to see the sync mode for each object.

### Delete tracking

Apollo.io doesn't expose a delete signal, audit log, or webhook for any object, so Workato can't detect deletions directly from the source.

For objects set to use full sync, Workato compares each run against the previous sync and marks records that no longer appear in Apollo.io as deleted in the destination. Deletions aren't detected for `contacts` or `analytics_report`, because both sync incrementally by default. An incremental run only pulls changed records and doesn't re-read the object's full history to compare against.

Refer to [Synthetic columns](#synthetic-columns) for the destination column this sets, and to the [Supported objects](#supported-objects) tables to see which sync mode each object uses.

## Schema and data type handling

The following considerations apply to schema and data types when you sync data from Apollo.io:

### Custom fields

Custom fields on `accounts`, `contacts`, `deals`, and `users` sync in the `typed_custom_fields` column as a JSON object keyed by field name, for example `{"Renewal date": "2026-01-15"}`. Workato distinguishes duplicate custom field names by appending the field's Apollo.io ID to the key. Workato doesn't sync custom fields as separate columns.

### Nested and list-valued fields

Nested objects and arrays, such as a contact's `phone_numbers`, sync as JSON in a single column. Workato doesn't flatten these formats into separate columns.

Workato syncs JSON fields to the destination's native JSON type, such as `VARIANT` in Snowflake. Workato serializes JSON fields as strings if the destination doesn't support a native JSON type.

### Monetary amounts

`deals.amount` reflects the deal's original currency, identified by the `currency` field. `deals.amount_in_team_currency` provides Apollo.io's own converted equivalent in your team's currency. Workato doesn't perform its own currency conversion.

### Synthetic columns

Workato adds the following synthetic columns to destination tables:

| Column | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_workato_run_id` | String | Identifies the pipeline run that last wrote the row. |
| `_workato_synced_at` | Timestamp | Records when Workato last synced the row. |
| `_workato_is_deleted` | Boolean | Set to `true` for records Workato detects as deleted. Present on full sync objects only. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information. |

## Sensitive data handling

Apollo.io objects can contain significant PII, including contact and account details captured from your sales and outreach activity. The following objects commonly contain sensitive fields:

| Object | Sensitive fields |
| --- | --- |
| `contacts` | `email`, `phone_numbers`, `sanitized_phone`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `name`, `linkedin_url`, `twitter_url`, `photo_url`, `present_raw_address` |
| `accounts` | `phone`, `sanitized_phone`, `linkedin_url` |
| `users` | `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `name`, `title` |
| `notes` | `content` |
| `tasks` | `note` |
| `calls` | `note`, `recording_url` |
| `outreach_emails` | `from_email`, `to_email`, `subject`, `body_text` |
| `conversations` | `participant_names`, `participants_info` |

Custom fields (`typed_custom_fields`) on `accounts`, `contacts`, `deals`, and `users` can also contain PII or other sensitive data, depending on what your workspace stores in them.

Use the **Hash** option in field-level data protection during pipeline configuration to protect PII before it reaches your destination. Refer to the [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) steps for more information.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use Apollo.io as a data pipeline source:

### Your API key must cover every object you sync

Use a master API key, or a scoped key granted access to every endpoint the objects you plan to sync require. Apollo.io returns a permissions error for any object your key doesn't cover. Refer to [Generate an Apollo.io API key](#generate-an-apolloio-api-key) for setup steps.

### Employment history isn't available

Apollo.io doesn't expose a contact's employment history through this connector. Job-change tracking based on employment history isn't available. Sync `contacts` for current job title and company information instead.

### Analytics report is limited to daily email-sent counts

`analytics_report` syncs only the daily count of emails sent (`num_emails_sent`), grouped by day. Other Apollo.io analytics metrics aren't available through this connector.

`analytics_report` is limited to `5` requests per hour regardless of plan. Apollo.io returns a rate-limit error when Workato exceeds a limit, and Workato retries automatically.

### Minimum sync frequency

The minimum supported sync interval is 15 minutes.
