> Configure Oracle E-Business Suite as a data pipeline source to extract and sync EBS database table records through an on-prem agent with full or incremental sync.

# Configure Oracle E-Business Suite as a data pipeline source

Set up Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) as a data pipeline source to extract and sync records from EBS database tables to your destination. The pipeline connects directly to the EBS database through an on-prem agent.

Use this guide to set up a database user, connect to EBS, configure your pipeline, and review sync behavior, data type handling, and limitations.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use Oracle E-Business Suite as a pipeline source:

- **On-prem connectivity**: Connect to the EBS database through an on-prem group. Cloud connections aren't supported.
- **Full sync and incremental sync**: Sync all rows on each run, or sync only new and updated rows based on a change tracking column. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
- **Table-level object selection**: Select individual tables from any schema the database user can access.
- **Primary key detection**: Detect primary keys from database constraints and EBS table metadata. Refer to [Primary keys](#primary-keys) for more information.
- **Delete tracking**: Mark records deleted at the source as deleted in the destination when a table runs in full sync mode.
- **Schema drift detection and handling**: Detect and apply schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or keep the schema fixed with **Block new fields**.
- **Field-level data protection**: Hash or replicate sensitive fields as is before the data reaches your destination.
- **Configurable sync frequency**: Schedule syncs on a time-based interval or with a cron expression. The minimum supported interval is 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Connecting Oracle E-Business Suite as a data pipeline source requires:

- An Oracle EBS database reachable from your on-prem agent host
- An on-prem agent running version 31.0 or later. Refer to the [on-prem agent documentation](/en/on-prem/agents/run) for setup steps.
- A database user with `SELECT` access to the EBS tables you plan to sync. Refer to [Set up a database user](#set-up-a-database-user) for the required grants.
- The database host, port, service name, username, and password for your EBS database

## Set up a database user

The database user for the pipeline must have `SELECT` on each table you plan to sync. Your database administrator can use an existing user or create a new user. Replace `WORKATO` in the following examples with the user's name:

Create the user and grant login access:

```sql
CREATE USER WORKATO IDENTIFIED BY <password>;
GRANT CONNECT TO WORKATO;
```

Grant `SELECT` on each table you plan to add as an object in your pipeline:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON <schema>.<table_name> TO WORKATO;
```

The pipeline fails with the error `Table '<SCHEMA>.<TABLE_NAME>' is not available. It may have been deleted, or your credentials lack permission to access it` if the user doesn't have `SELECT` on a table you add.

Grant `SELECT` on the following EBS metadata tables in the `APPLSYS` schema:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON APPLSYS.FND_TABLES TO WORKATO;
GRANT SELECT ON APPLSYS.FND_PRIMARY_KEYS TO WORKATO;
GRANT SELECT ON APPLSYS.FND_PRIMARY_KEY_COLUMNS TO WORKATO;
GRANT SELECT ON APPLSYS.FND_COLUMNS TO WORKATO;
```

Workato reads these tables to detect the primary key for tables that don't have a primary key, unique constraint, or unique index in the database. Tables without a database key fail to load with an `Error running query on agent` error if the user can't read these tables. Refer to [Primary keys](#primary-keys) for more information.

## Supported connection types

Oracle E-Business Suite pipelines support username and password authentication through an on-prem group.

Data pipelines use the **Oracle E-Business Suite (Data Pipelines)** connector, which reads directly from the EBS database. Connections you create with the [Oracle E-Business Suite](/en/connectors/oracle-ebs) connector for recipes use Integrated SOA Gateway REST services and aren't available as a pipeline source. You must create a separate connection for your pipeline.

> **CLOUD CONNECTIONS NOT SUPPORTED**
> 
> You must select an on-prem group in the **Connection type** field. The connection form doesn't show the database fields when you select **Cloud**.

## Connect to Oracle E-Business Suite

Complete the following steps to connect Oracle E-Business Suite as a data pipeline source:

1. Select **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `Oracle E-Business Suite (Data Pipelines)` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name in the **Connection name** field.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Use the **Connection type** drop-down menu to select the on-prem group that can reach your EBS database.
   
6. Enter the service name of your EBS database in the **Service name** field.
   
7. Enter the host address of your EBS database in the **Database host** field.
   
8. Enter the port number in the **Database port** field. The default Oracle port is `1521`.
   
9. Enter the username of the database user from [Set up a database user](#set-up-a-database-user) in the **User name** field.
   
10. Enter the password in the **Password** field.
    
11. Optional. Enter a schema in the **Schema** field.
    
12. Select **Connect** to verify and save the connection.
    

## Configure the pipeline

Complete the following steps to configure Oracle E-Business Suite as your data pipeline source:

1. Select **Create > Data pipeline** or press C+I.
   
2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from Oracle E-Business Suite.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **Oracle E-Business Suite (Data Pipelines)**.
   
7. Choose the Oracle E-Business Suite connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel.
   
9. Search or browse the list of available EBS tables, select the tables you plan to sync, and click **Add**.
   
10. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. The pipeline automatically fetches an object's schema when you select it. This ensures the destination matches the source.
    
    Expand an object to view associated fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication.
    
11. Optional. Click the gear icon next to a table to open **Sync mode** settings and use the **Sync mode** drop-down menu to select **Full sync** or **Incremental**, then click **Save**.
    
    The sync mode defaults to **Incremental** for every table. Incremental sync fails for tables that don't have one of the [default change tracking columns](#incremental-sync). Select a column in the **Change tracking column** field for these tables, or select **Full sync**.
    
    Changing the **Sync mode** or **Change tracking column** triggers a full re-sync of the table on the next pipeline run.
    
12. Optional. Configure field-level data protection by expanding an object and choosing how to handle each field:
    
    - **Replicate as is**: Data values at the source replicate identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the field before syncing to your destination.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive fields.
    
13. Click **Add object** again to add more objects. Repeat this step to include additional Oracle E-Business Suite objects in your pipeline.
    
14. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
15. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from Oracle E-Business Suite to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    The start date applies only to tables with a change tracking column. Refer to [Full sync](#full-sync) for more information.
    

## Supported objects

Oracle E-Business Suite data pipelines sync data from tables in the connected EBS database. Workato lists every table the database user can access, across all schemas, when you click **Add object**. Each table appears as `<SCHEMA>.<TABLE_NAME>` and syncs as a separate table in your destination.

Only tables are listed. Views and synonyms aren't available as objects.

### Primary keys

Workato identifies the primary key for each table in the following order:

- **Database constraints**: The table's enabled primary key or unique constraint, or a unique index.
- **EBS metadata**: The primary key registered for the table in the EBS `FND_PRIMARY_KEYS` metadata table. Workato can read this metadata only if the database user has access to the `APPLSYS` tables listed in [Set up a database user](#set-up-a-database-user).
- **ROWID**: Workato adds a `ROWID` column as the primary key when neither source explicitly defines a primary key. Refer to [Tables keyed by ROWID](#tables-keyed-by-rowid) for how this affects syncs.

## Sync modes

Oracle E-Business Suite data pipelines support full sync and incremental sync. The sync mode is configured per table when you add it to your pipeline.

### Full sync

A full sync reads the source table on each pipeline run. Use full sync for tables without a change tracking column. Full syncs of large EBS tables can take longer and use more resources than incremental syncs.

The rows a full sync reads depend on the pipeline start date in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field:

- **Tables with a change tracking column**: Full syncs read only rows with a change tracking value on or after the start date. Rows with an earlier or null change tracking value don't sync, and aren't marked as deleted by delete tracking. Full syncs read every row if you leave the start date blank.
- **Tables without a change tracking column**: Full syncs read every row, regardless of the start date.

### Incremental sync

An incremental sync reads only rows whose change tracking column changed since the previous run. The first run of an incremental table is a full sync. Workato checks for the following columns in this order and selects the first one that exists in the table as the default change tracking column:

- `LAST_UPDATE_DATE`
- `UPDATED`
- `LAST_MODIFIED_DATE`

You can select a different column in the **Change tracking column** field of the table's sync settings. Incremental syncs fail for tables that don't have one of the default columns and have no column selected. Select a change tracking column for these tables or switch them to full sync. Refer to [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) for the sync settings step.

Incremental sync detects a changed row only when the change tracking column changes. Incremental syncs don't pick up rows updated without a new change tracking value, or rows with a null change tracking value.

### Delete tracking

Delete tracking depends on the sync mode:

- **Full sync**: Workato marks records deleted at the source as deleted in the destination on the next full sync.
- **Incremental sync**: Deletes aren't detected, because each run reads only rows with a new change tracking value.

## Schema and data type handling

Workato maps Oracle column types to destination types as follows:

| Oracle type | Synced as |
| --- | --- |
| `NUMBER`, `INTEGER`, `INT`, `SMALLINT`, `DECIMAL`, `NUMERIC` | Decimal |
| `FLOAT`, `BINARY_FLOAT`, `BINARY_DOUBLE` | Double |
| `BOOLEAN` | Boolean |
| `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP` | Timestamp without time zone |
| `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`, `TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE` | Timestamp with time zone |
| `CHAR`, `NCHAR`, `VARCHAR2`, `NVARCHAR2`, `LONG`, `ROWID` | String |
| `CLOB`, `NCLOB`, `XMLTYPE`, `RAW`, `LONG RAW`, `BLOB` | String, using the destination's maximum string length |
| `INTERVAL` types, `SDO_GEOMETRY`, and other types | String |

Numeric columns sync as strings instead of decimals when the column doesn't have declared precision, a negative scale, a precision greater than 38, or a scale greater than the declared precision. Oracle `DATE` columns include a time of day that sync as timestamps.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use Oracle E-Business Suite as a data pipeline source:

### Tables keyed by ROWID

Workato uses `ROWID` as the primary key for tables that don't have a primary key in the database or in EBS metadata. These tables show a `ROWID` field in the schema when you add them to your pipeline. A `ROWID` reflects where Oracle physically stores the row, so it can change when the row moves on disk, even if the row's contents don't change. Refer to the Oracle [ROWID pseudocolumn](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/sqlrf/ROWID-Pseudocolumn.html) documentation for more information.

A full sync can miss a row if the row's `ROWID` changes during the sync. The next run picks up the row if the table uses full sync, because each full sync reads the table again. Incremental syncs don't pick up the missed row unless the change tracking column changes. Run an [object re-sync](/en/data-orchestration/sync-types#object-re-sync) of the table to load the latest data into your destination.

> **USE FULL SYNC FOR ROWID TABLES**
> 
> Use full sync for tables keyed by `ROWID` if you're unsure whether the table rows move on disk.

### Minimum sync frequency

The minimum supported sync interval is 15 minutes.
