# Configure Google Sheets as your data pipeline source

Set up Google Sheets as a data pipeline source to extract spreadsheet data into your destination. Each sheet (tab) you select syncs as its own table, so you can move data from ad hoc spreadsheets into your data warehouse.

Use this guide to set up a connection, configure your pipeline, and understand how objects sync, sync behavior, schema and data type handling, and known limitations.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use Google Sheets as a pipeline source:

- **Cloud connectivity**: Connect to Google Sheets over HTTPS through Google's global API. On-prem agents aren't required.
- **Full refresh sync**: Reads the complete contents of every selected sheet on every scheduled run. Google Sheets exposes no row-level change timestamps, so incremental sync isn't supported. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
- **Object-level selection**: Select individual sheet tabs to sync. Each tab syncs as a separate table in your destination.
- **Primary-key-based upsert or full overwrite**: Set a primary key on an object to upsert rows and track deletions, or leave the primary key unset to overwrite the destination table on every sync. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
- **Schema drift detection and handling**: Detect and apply schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or keep the schema fixed with **Block new fields**.
- **Field-level data protection**: Hash or replicate sensitive fields as is before the data reaches your destination.
- **Configurable sync frequency**: Schedule syncs on a time-based interval or with a cron expression.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following requirements before you connect Google Sheets as a data pipeline source.

- A Google account or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service account with access to the spreadsheets you plan to sync
- Credentials for your chosen authentication method:
  - **OAuth 2.0**: A Google user account that can complete Google's OAuth consent flow.
  - **Service account**: A GCP service account email and private key.

> **REQUIRED PERMISSIONS**
> 
> Grant the service account at least **Viewer** access on each spreadsheet you plan to sync. Service accounts don't inherit access from Drive folder-level sharing unless your organization has configured Domain-Wide Delegation, which isn't supported for this connector. Refer to [Limitations](#limitations) for more information.

## Supported connection types

Google Sheets data pipelines support two authentication methods:

- **OAuth 2.0**: Connect using a Google user account through Google's OAuth consent screen. Workato recommends this method for individual users or teams.
- **Service account**: Connect using a GCP service account email and private key. Workato recommends this method for automated, non-interactive pipelines. The service account must be explicitly shared on each spreadsheet you plan to sync.

## Connect to Google Sheets

Complete the following steps to connect Google Sheets as a data pipeline source.

Connect to Google Sheets

The Google Sheets connector supports the following authentication methods:

- [OAuth 2.0](#oauth-2-0)
- [Service account](#service-account)

> **SERVICE ACCOUNT AUTHENTICATION**
> 
> You can use a service account to authenticate without a personal user account. For consistent use, Workato recommends service account authentication.

### OAuth 2.0

Complete the following steps to set up an OAuth 2.0 connection:

1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Provide a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
   
   ![OAuth 2.0 connection fields](/assets/connection.C-Rm0AtF.png)_OAuth 2.0 connection fields_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
4. Search for and select **Google Sheets** as your connection on the **New connection** page.
   
5. Use the **Authentication type** drop-down menu to select `OAuth 2.0`.
   
6. Optional. Use the **Disable formula** drop-down menu to select whether to disable adding and updating rows with formulas.
   
7. Optional. Use the **Custom OAuth profiles** drop-down menu to select a custom OAuth profile for this connection.
   
8. Click **Sign in with Google**.
   
9. Sign in with your Google account.

    ![Click Allow to enable Workato to access your Google account](/assets/allow.DBxsc8xF.png)_Click **Allow** to enable Workato to access your Google account_
    

### Service account

A Google service account is a specialized Google account associated with a Google Cloud Project (GCP) that can run API requests on your behalf.

Service accounts provide the following benefits:

- **Continuous operation:** Service accounts ensure that operations continue even if individual user permissions change.
- **Dedicated permissions:** Service accounts can only access projects that you share with them.
- **Dedicated API quotas:** You can manage a service account's API quotas through GCP and request quota increases directly from Google.

Refer to the [Google service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) to learn more about service accounts.

> **REAL-TIME TRIGGER LIMITATIONS**
> 
> Service accounts don't support real-time triggers for Google Sheets. Use [OAuth 2.0](#oauth-2-0) authentication to monitor Google Sheets in real-time.

#### Set up a Google service account

Service account authentication requires the following prerequisites:

- [Create a service account and generate a private key](#set-up-a-google-service-account)
- [Enable the Google Sheets API](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841)

Complete the following steps to set up a Google service account:

1. [Create a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating) in your GCP project.
   
2. Go to **IAM & Admin > Service accounts**. Ensure your dashboard is scoped to the project that contains your service account.
   
   ![Check the scope of your dashboard.](/assets/service-project-scope.8Rf50DK2.png)_Check the scope of your dashboard._
   
3. Click the **Email** of the service account you intend to use.
   
   ![Click the email of the service account you intend to use.](/assets/service-email-button.C9qaZFkJ.png)_Click the **Email** of the service account you intend to use._
   
4. Copy the service account's **Email** and save it to configure your connection later.
   
   ![Copy the account's email](/assets/service-account-email.DM6BBBhN.png)_Copy the account's **Email**._
   
5. Go to the **KEYS** tab.
   
6. [Generate a private key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating_service_account_keys) and download it in JSON format. You can only download the key once.
   
7. Open the JSON file, then copy the entire private key from `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` to `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n` (inclusive) and save it to configure your connection later.
   

The email associated with your service account must have access to the Google Sheets you plan to use in recipes. You can share specific sheets from within Google Sheets.

## Configure the pipeline

Complete the following steps to configure Google Sheets as your data pipeline source:

1. Select **Create > Data pipeline** or press C+I.
   
2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from Google Sheets.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **Google Sheets**.
   
7. Choose the Google Sheets connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Select the **Google Drive** that contains your spreadsheets. A single pipeline can sync sheets from multiple spreadsheets within this Drive. Create a separate pipeline to sync sheets from a different Drive.
   
9. Click **Add object** to configure a sheet you plan to sync.
   
   ![Add Google Sheets objects](/assets/google-sheets-add-objects.CcQJgy1k.png)_Add Google Sheets objects_
   
10. Configure the sheet settings:
    
    1. Use the **Spreadsheet** fields to select the spreadsheet that contains the sheet you plan to sync, or switch the adjoining drop-down to enter the spreadsheet ID directly.
       
    2. Use the **Sheet** drop-down menu to select the tab you plan to sync as a table.
       
       ![Select a sheet from the list](/assets/select-google-sheets-sheet-name.al0fUs87.png)_Select a sheet from the list_
       
       You can also toggle the field to enter the sheet name directly.
       
       ![Enter the sheet name directly](/assets/google-sheets-sheet-name-toggle.CPqt49hd.png)_Enter the sheet name directly_
       
    3. Use the **Header row** drop-down menu to indicate whether the first row of the sheet contains column names. Select **Yes** to treat the first row as column headers, or **No** to treat every row as data and auto-name columns `col1`, `col2`, and so on.
       
       ![Configure Google Sheets settings](/assets/google-sheets-configure-objects.CLwtbTrU.png)_Configure Google Sheets settings_
       
    4. Optional. Enter a range in A1 notation, such as `B:F`, in the **Column range** field to limit the sync to specific columns. Leave this field blank to sync every populated column.
       
    5. Use the **Infer column types** drop-down menu to select how Workato reads column values. Select **Yes** to detect column types from the data. Rows with a value that doesn't match the detected type fail to sync. Select **No** to sync every column as text.
       
11. Click **Fetch schema**.
    
12. Review the columns Workato detected for the sheet. Optionally select one or more columns in the **Primary key** field.
    
    ![Review schema](/assets/google-sheets-review-schema.Clg2jKBO.png)_Review schema_
    
    Workato only fetches the columns within your configured **Column range**. For example, entering `A:C` limits the detected schema to three columns:
    
    ![Review schema limited to a column range of A:C](/assets/google-sheets-review-schema-column-range.BbDyo5cp.png)_Review schema limited to a column range of A:C_
    
    > **CHOOSING A PRIMARY KEY**
    > 
    > Setting a primary key upserts rows in the destination and marks rows removed from the sheet as deleted. Leaving the primary key blank overwrites the entire destination table on every sync instead. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information. You can select up to five columns as a composite primary key.
    
13. Click **Review object** to confirm your setup.
    
    ![Review object](/assets/google-sheets-review-object.CfSKMXV0.png)_Review object_
    
14. Enter an **Object name**. This name defines the destination table name.
    
15. Click **Finish** to save the object configuration.
    
16. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. The pipeline automatically fetches an object's schema when you select it. This ensures the destination matches the source.
    
    Expand an object to view associated fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication.
    
17. Optional. Configure field-level data protection. Choose how to handle each field after you expand an object:
    
    - **Replicate as is** (default): Data values at the source are replicated identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the column before syncing to your destination.
    
    Refer to [Sensitive data handling](#sensitive-data-handling) for more information.
    
18. Click **Add object** again to add more objects using the same flow. You can add sheets from multiple spreadsheets within the same Drive to one pipeline.
    
19. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
20. Configure how often the pipeline syncs data from Google Sheets to the destination in the **Frequency** field. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter **12** in the **Trigger every** field, the pipeline syncs every 12 hours.
       
    3. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Select **Custom schedule** in the **Time unit** field.
       
    2. Enter a **Cron expression** in the `Cron expression` field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       For example, to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC, enter:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    

## How objects sync

Each Google Sheets object corresponds to one sheet (tab) within a spreadsheet. Workato discovers the sheet's schema from the first row and syncs the sheet to its own table in your destination. Workato discovers and rebuilds this schema for each connection rather than relying on a fixed object catalog.

Workato only syncs grid-type sheets, the standard sheets made up of rows and columns. Chart sheets and object sheets (embedded drawings or forms) aren't supported.

Workato continues to track and sync the sheet tab internally if you rename it after selecting it as an object. The sync fails until you remove or reconfigure the object if you delete the tab.

### Header rows, blank headers, and empty rows

Workato applies the following rules when it reads a sheet:

- Columns whose header cell is blank or contains only whitespace are excluded from the sync. Use a blank header to intentionally hide a column from the pipeline.
- Workato appends the column's letter to disambiguate columns when a sheet has two or more columns with the same header value. For example, two columns both named `Score` in columns C and G sync as `Score_C` and `Score_G`.
- Rows where every cell is empty are excluded from the destination. Workato doesn't persist empty rows as null-valued records.

## Sync modes

Google Sheets data pipelines support full-refresh sync only because the Sheets API exposes no per-row timestamps or change cursor. Workato re-reads the full contents of every selected sheet on every scheduled run, rather than syncing incrementally.

A full re-read on every run correctly captures data changes regardless of how they were made, including changes from Google Forms submissions or `IMPORTRANGE()` formulas.

### Delete tracking

Whether an object upserts or overwrites depends on whether you set a primary key when you add the object:

- **Primary key set**: Workato upserts rows, matching on the primary key. Rows removed from the sheet remain in the destination and are marked as deleted.
- **No primary key**: Workato overwrites the entire destination table on every sync. Rows removed from the sheet are also removed from the destination, with no deleted-row history.

## Schema and data type handling

The following considerations apply to schema and data types when you sync data from Google Sheets.

### Type inference

Set **Infer column types** to **No** (the default) to sync every column as text. Set it to **Yes** to infer each column's type from its data instead, from narrowest to widest in the order boolean, integer, long, double, decimal, and text.

Workato infers a column's type once, during the initial sync, and doesn't widen it automatically afterward. A row fails to sync if a later sync encounters a value that doesn't match the inferred type, such as text in a column inferred as a number. Reset the object's schema if a column's values need to change type.

> **DATES AND TIMESTAMPS SYNC AS TEXT**
> 
> Workato doesn't convert Google Sheets date or timestamp values to date or timestamp types, even when **Infer column types** is set to **Yes**. Date and time values sync as their displayed text (for example, `1/15/2024`). Transform these fields to the appropriate type in your destination after the load completes.

### Column names

Workato preserves sheet column headers exactly as typed, including spaces and special characters. Workato automatically converts column names to valid identifiers when it writes to a destination that requires SQL-safe identifiers.

## Sensitive data handling

Any column in any synced sheet can contain personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data, because Google Sheets column schemas are entirely customer-defined. Workato can't predict which fields are sensitive in advance, unlike connectors with a fixed object catalog.

Before you sync a spreadsheet that contains sensitive data, review its columns and use the **Hash** option in field-level data protection to mask any column that shouldn't reach your destination as is. Refer to the [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) steps for more information.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use Google Sheets as a data pipeline source.

### 10 million cell quota

Google Sheets enforces a hard platform quota of 10 million cells per spreadsheet, shared across all tabs combined, rather than per tab. For example, a spreadsheet with 5 tabs shares one 10-million-cell pool. A sheet caps at approximately 385,000 rows at the default column count of 26, or approximately 547 rows at the maximum column count of 18,278. Google enforces this quota, not Workato.

### Shared Drive spreadsheets aren't supported

This connector doesn't currently support spreadsheets stored in a Shared Drive (Team Drive). Use a spreadsheet stored in a personal Google Drive (My Drive).

### Domain-Wide Delegation isn't supported

Service accounts can only access spreadsheets they're explicitly shared on. Domain-Wide Delegation, which lets a service account inherit access to sheets it doesn't own, isn't supported.

### API key authentication isn't supported

Google's public API keys don't grant access to private spreadsheets, so Workato doesn't support API key authentication for this connector. Use OAuth 2.0 or a service account instead.
