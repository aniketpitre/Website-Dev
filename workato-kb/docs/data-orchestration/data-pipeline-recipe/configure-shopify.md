# Configure Shopify as a data pipeline source

Set up Shopify as a data pipeline source to extract commerce data, such as orders, products, customers, and transactions, from your Shopify store into your destination using the Shopify GraphQL Admin API.

Use this guide to review supported features, complete the prerequisites, connect to Shopify, configure the pipeline, and understand supported objects, sync modes, schema handling, and limitations.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use Shopify as a pipeline source:

- **Full sync and incremental sync**: Sync complete datasets or only new and updated records. Incremental sync uses each object's cursor field, such as `updated_at`.
- **Object-level selection**: Choose which Shopify objects to sync. All objects are available through a single connection per store.
- **Field-level selection**: Expand any object to include or exclude specific fields from extraction and schema replication.
- **Soft delete tracking**: Track state-based deletions, such as cancelled orders and archived products, through the `_workato_is_deleted` column for supported objects. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information.
- **Schema drift detection and handling**: Detect and apply schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or keep the schema fixed with **Block new fields**.
- **Field-level data protection**: Hash or replicate sensitive fields as is before the data reaches your destination.
- **Configurable sync frequency**: Schedule syncs on a time-based interval or with a cron expression. The minimum supported interval is 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following requirements before you configure Shopify as a data pipeline source:

- A Shopify store with permission to install and authorize apps.
- Credentials for your chosen authentication method. Data pipelines connect to one Shopify store per connection:
  - **OAuth 2.0**: Permission to authorize the connection in your Shopify store.
  - **Access token**: An Admin API access token from a custom app in your Shopify store. Refer to Shopify's [Create and install a custom app](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/app-types/custom-apps) documentation for more information.
- Protected Customer Data approval from Shopify, granted through the Shopify Partner Dashboard. Shopify requires this approval before an app can access customer personally identifiable information (PII), such as email addresses, phone numbers, and addresses, in `customers` and `orders` data. Refer to Shopify's [Protected customer data](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/protected-customer-data) documentation for more information.
- The `read_all_orders` scope approval if you plan to sync order history older than 60 days. Refer to [Recommended permissions](#recommended-permissions) for more information.

> **REQUEST APPROVALS EARLY**
> 
> Shopify approval for the `read_all_orders` scope typically takes two to four weeks through the Partner Dashboard. Custom apps created directly in the Shopify admin receive this scope automatically.

### Recommended permissions

Grant the following read-only scopes when you authorize the connection. Each scope determines which objects the pipeline can sync. Data pipelines require only `read_*` scopes and perform no write operations. The Shopify authorization screen may request `write_*` scopes as part of the shared Shopify connection app defaults. Data pipelines don't use them.

| Shopify scope | Grants access to |
| --- | --- |
| `read_orders` | `orders`, `order_line_items`, `transactions`, `refunds` |
| `read_all_orders` | Full order history. Requires Shopify approval. Refer to [Order history requires the read\_all\_orders scope](#order-history-requires-read-all-orders) for more information. |
| `read_products` | `products`, `product_variants`, `collections`, `collection_products` |
| `read_customers` | `customers` |
| `read_inventory` | `inventory_items` |
| `read_locations` | `locations` |
| `read_fulfillments` | `fulfillments` |
| `read_draft_orders` | `draft_orders` |
| `read_checkouts` | `abandoned_checkouts` |
| `read_content` | Metafields and metaobjects |

Workato doesn't validate scopes when you establish the connection. A missing scope surfaces as an error only when the pipeline syncs an object that requires it. Verify your granted scopes against the preceding table before you run the pipeline.

## Supported connection types

Shopify data pipelines support the following authentication methods:

- **OAuth 2.0**: Authorize the connection through your Shopify store. Workato redirects you to Shopify to grant the requested scopes.
- **Access token**: Authenticate with an Admin API access token from a custom app created in your Shopify store. Custom apps receive the `read_all_orders` scope automatically.

## Connection setup

Complete the following steps to connect to Shopify:

Connect to Shopify

The Shopify connector supports the following authentication types:

- [OAuth 2.0 authentication](#oauth2)
- [Access token authentication](#access-token)

You must have a Shopify Partner account to connect to Shopify in Workato. Refer to the Shopify [Create an account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup) documentation for more information.

### OAuth 2.0 authentication

You must create an OAuth profile to use OAuth 2.0 authentication. Refer to [Create an OAuth profile](#oauth-profile-oauth2) for more information.

## Configure the pipeline

Complete the following steps to configure Shopify as your data pipeline source:

1. Select **Create > Data pipeline** or press C+I.
   
2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from Shopify.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **Shopify**.
   
7. Choose the Shopify connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel.
   
   ![Add Shopify objects](/assets/add-objects-shopify.DW-CGHav.png)_Add Shopify objects_
   
9. Search or browse the list of available Shopify objects, select the objects you plan to sync, and click **Add**.
   
   > **ORDERS OBJECT SCOPE**
   > 
   > The `orders` object syncs only completed customer orders. Draft orders and abandoned checkouts are separate objects. Add `draft_orders` and `abandoned_checkouts` to your pipeline if you plan to sync these objects.
   
10. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. The pipeline automatically fetches the object schema you select to ensure the destination matches the source.
    
    Expand an object to view its fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude data from extraction and schema replication.
    
    ![Review object fields](/assets/shopify-object-fields.CnSP9TJY.png)_Review object fields_
    
11. Optional. Configure field-level data protection by expanding an object and choosing how to handle each field:
    
    - **Replicate as is**: Data values at the source replicate identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the field before syncing to your destination.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive fields. Refer to [Sensitive data handling](#sensitive-data-handling) for a list of fields that commonly contain PII.
    
12. Click **Add object** again to add more objects. Repeat this step to include additional Shopify objects in your pipeline.
    
13. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
14. Optional. Enter a value in the **Concurrency limit** field to cap the number of concurrent operations. Leave the field blank to use the default quota set by Workato. The maximum value is `100`.
    
15. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from Shopify to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    

## Supported objects

Shopify data pipelines sync data from the Shopify GraphQL Admin API. The following tables list the supported objects, grouped by category. Each object syncs as a separate table in your destination.

### Core commerce

| Object | Sync modes | Incremental mechanism | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `orders` | Full sync, incremental | `updated_at` | Yes (soft) |
| `order_line_items` | Full sync, incremental | Syncs with the parent `orders` object | No |
| `products` | Full sync, incremental | `updated_at` | Yes (soft) |
| `product_variants` | Full sync, incremental | Syncs with the parent `products` object | No |
| `transactions` | Full sync, incremental | Syncs with the parent `orders` object | No |
| `refunds` | Full sync, incremental | Syncs with the parent `orders` object | No |
| `customers` | Full sync, incremental | `updated_at` | No |

### Inventory and fulfillment

| Object | Sync modes | Incremental mechanism | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `inventory_items` | Full sync, incremental | `updated_at` | No |
| `locations` | Full sync only | None | Yes (soft) |
| `fulfillments` | Full sync, incremental | Syncs with the parent `orders` object | No |

### Marketing and content

| Object | Sync modes | Incremental mechanism | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `collections` | Full sync, incremental | `updated_at` | No |
| `collection_products` | Full sync, incremental | Syncs with the parent `collections` object | No |
| `abandoned_checkouts` | Full sync, incremental | `updated_at` | No |

### Extended

| Object | Sync modes | Incremental mechanism | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `draft_orders` | Full sync, incremental | `updated_at` | No |
| `shop` | Full sync only | None (single record) | No |
| `tender_transactions` | Full sync, incremental | `processed_at` | No |
| `gift_cards` | Full sync only | None | Yes (soft) |

The `gift_cards` object requires a Shopify Plus plan. Shopify returns an error if you sync this object from a store that isn't on a Plus plan.

### Metafields and metaobjects

Shopify stores support custom data through metafields and metaobjects. Shopify data pipelines sync both:

- **Metafields**: Workato discovers metafield definitions from your store and includes them as additional columns on the parent object's table. Metafield columns are supported on the `orders`, `products`, `product_variants`, `customers`, `draft_orders`, `locations`, and `collections` objects.
- **Metaobjects**: Each metaobject type defined in your store is available as a separately selectable object and syncs as its own table.

The schema for metafields and metaobjects depends on the definitions in your store. If an expected metafield column doesn't appear, verify that the metafield definition exists in your store.

## Sync modes

Shopify data pipelines support full sync and incremental sync.

### Full sync

Full sync syncs re-extract the complete dataset for an object from Shopify. The `shop`, `locations`, and `gift_cards` objects use full sync. The deleted state for `locations` and `gift_cards` is re-derived on each full sync. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information.

### Incremental sync

Incremental syncs extract only records created or updated after the previous sync, using each object's cursor field. Standalone objects use the `updated_at` field, except the `tender_transactions` object, which uses `processed_at`.

Child objects sync with their parent object and use the parent's cursor rather than their own fields. The `order_line_items`, `transactions`, `refunds`, and `fulfillments` objects sync when their parent order syncs, the `product_variants` object syncs when its parent product syncs, and the `collection_products` object syncs when its parent collection syncs.

### Delete tracking

Shopify data pipelines track soft deletes for supported objects using each object's state field. When a record enters a deleted state in Shopify, the pipeline sets the `_workato_is_deleted` column to `true` in the destination on the next sync.

The following objects support soft delete tracking:

| Object | Shopify state that marks the record as deleted |
| --- | --- |
| `orders` | The order is cancelled (`cancelled_at` is set) |
| `products` | The product status is changed to **Archived** |
| `locations` | The location is deactivated |
| `gift_cards` | The gift card is disabled |

All other objects, including `customers` and all child objects, don't include the `_workato_is_deleted` column.

Hard deletes aren't tracked for any object. Refer to [Hard deletes aren't tracked](#hard-deletes-are-not-tracked) for more information.

## Schema and data type handling

Shopify data pipelines flatten nested GraphQL structures into relational columns.

### Monetary amounts

Money fields expand into four columns per field, covering the shop currency and presentment currency: `{field}_set_shop_amount`, `{field}_set_shop_currency_code`, `{field}_set_presentment_amount`, and `{field}_set_presentment_currency_code`. For example, an order's total price syncs as `total_price_set_shop_amount`, `total_price_set_shop_currency_code`, `total_price_set_presentment_amount`, and `total_price_set_presentment_currency_code`.

### Addresses

Address objects flatten into individual component columns, such as `billing_address_address_1`, `billing_address_city`, and `billing_address_country_code`. Shipping addresses flatten into the same components with the `shipping_address_` prefix.

### Tags

Tag lists sync as a single comma-separated string column.

### Record IDs

Record IDs sync as numeric IDs rather than Shopify GraphQL global IDs. For example, a product syncs with the ID `123456789` instead of `gid://shopify/Product/123456789`.

### Synthetic columns

Workato adds the following synthetic column to destination tables for specific objects:

| Column | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_workato_is_deleted` | Boolean | Marks records that entered a deleted state in Shopify. Applies only to `orders`, `products`, `locations`, and `gift_cards`. |

Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for the state changes that set this column.

## Sensitive data handling

Shopify objects can contain customer personally identifiable information (PII). The following objects commonly contain sensitive fields:

| Object | Sensitive fields |
| --- | --- |
| `orders` | `email`, `client_ip`, `billing_address_*` fields, `shipping_address_*` fields |
| `customers` | `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `phone` |

Shopify gates access to customer PII behind Protected Customer Data approval. Refer to [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) for more information.

Use the **Hash** option in field-level data protection during pipeline configuration to protect PII before it reaches your destination. Refer to the [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) steps for more information.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use Shopify as a data pipeline source:

### Hard deletes aren't tracked

Shopify removes hard-deleted records from the API without a deletion marker. When a record is hard deleted in the Shopify admin, the pipeline receives no signal, and the record remains in your destination indefinitely. This applies to every object type.

Child records of a hard-deleted parent, such as variants of a deleted product, also remain in the destination and aren't marked as deleted.

Plan a periodic reconciliation process in your destination if stale records affect your downstream use cases. Soft deletes, such as cancelled orders and archived products, are tracked for supported objects. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information.

### Orders object excludes draft orders and abandoned checkouts

The `orders` object syncs only completed customer orders. Draft orders and abandoned checkouts aren't included in the `orders` object, even though the Shopify admin may display draft orders alongside complete orders. Sync the `draft_orders` and `abandoned_checkouts` objects separately if you plan to include this data.

### Order history requires the `read_all_orders` scope

Shopify limits order data to the last 60 days unless your app is approved for the `read_all_orders` scope. Request approval through the Shopify Partner Dashboard before your initial sync if you plan to sync full order history. Approval typically takes two to four weeks. Custom apps created directly in the Shopify admin receive this scope automatically.

### Child record updates depend on parent updates

All child objects sync when their parent record's cursor field changes. This applies to the `order_line_items`, `transactions`, `refunds`, and `fulfillments` objects (children of `orders`), the `product_variants` object (child of `products`), and the `collection_products` object (child of `collections`). A change to a child record that doesn't update the parent's `updated_at` timestamp isn't picked up by incremental syncs until the parent changes. Run a full sync if you need to capture child-only changes immediately.

### Customer data redaction

Shopify may redact customer PII to comply with GDPR requests. Redacted customer records can remain in Shopify as record shells with scrubbed fields, and these shells sync to your destination. Customer records that Shopify removes entirely aren't detected as deleted. Refer to [Hard deletes aren't tracked](#hard-deletes-are-not-tracked) for more information.

### Minimum sync frequency

The minimum supported sync interval is 15 minutes.
