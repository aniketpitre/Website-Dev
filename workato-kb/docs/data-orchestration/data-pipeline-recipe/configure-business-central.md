2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from Microsoft Dynamics Business Central.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **Microsoft Dynamics Business Central**.
   
7. Choose the Microsoft Dynamics Business Central connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Use the **Company** drop-down menu to select the Business Central company you plan to sync data from.
   
9. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel. Workato scopes the object list to the company you selected and displays each object as its display name and entity name, for example, `Customer (customer)`.
   
   ![Add objects](/assets/add-objects-dynamics-central.D-FNfLWz.png)_Add objects_
   
10. Search or browse the list of available Business Central objects, select the objects you plan to sync, and click **Add**.
    
    ![Select objects](/assets/select-objects-dynamics-central.BbKULKTL.png)_Select objects_
    
11. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. The pipeline automatically fetches an object's schema when you select it. This ensures the destination matches the source.
    
    Expand an object to view associated fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication.
    
    System ID is included automatically for every object and can't be deselected.
    
12. Optional. Click the settings icon next to an object to configure how the object syncs. Use the **Sync mode** drop-down menu to select **Full sync** or **Incremental**. Workato defaults to full sync if it doesn't detect a timestamp field for the object. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
    
13. Optional. Configure field-level data protection by expanding an object and choosing how to handle each field:
    
    - **Replicate as is**: Data values at the source replicate identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the field before syncing to your destination.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive fields.
    
14. Click **Add object** again to add more objects. Repeat this step to include additional Microsoft Dynamics Business Central objects in your pipeline.
    
15. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
16. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from Microsoft Dynamics Business Central to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).

## Sync modes

Data pipelines support the following sync modes for Business Central objects:

### Full sync

A full sync reads all available records for the selected object from Business Central and replaces the entire dataset in the destination with the latest data.

### Incremental sync

An incremental sync extracts only records created or updated since the last sync run, using a timestamp field on the object to detect changes. If Workato doesn't detect a timestamp field for an object, the pipeline defaults to full sync for that object.

## Company-scoped data

Business Central data pipelines scope data extraction to a single company at a time. The **Company ID** field in the connection configuration sets a default company for the connection. Leave this field blank at the connection level to select the company per pipeline instead, using the **Company** drop-down menu in [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline).

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use Business Central as a data pipeline source:

### Read-only extraction

Business Central data pipelines support read-only extraction. Inserts, modifications, and deletes aren't supported. Business Central is supported as a source only, not as a destination.
