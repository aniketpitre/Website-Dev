# Configure Jira as a data pipeline source

Set up Jira as a data pipeline source to extract issues, projects, users, and related records into your destination. Use this guide to set up a connection, configure your pipeline, add objects, and understand sync behavior and known limitations.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use Jira as a pipeline source:

- **Cloud and on-premise connectivity**: Connect to Jira Cloud through HTTPS, or to Jira Server and Jira Data Center through an on-prem group. Refer to [Supported connection types](#supported-connection-types) for the connection options available for each deployment.
- **Full refresh and incremental sync**: Supports full refresh and incremental sync modes. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
- **Object-level selection**: Select Jira objects to sync as separate tables in your destination.
- **Field-level selection**: Choose which fields to include or exclude from each object during extraction and schema replication.
- **Schema drift detection and handling**: Detect and apply schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or keep the schema fixed with **Block new fields**.
- **Field-level data protection**: Hash or replicate sensitive fields as is before the data reaches your destination.
- **Configurable sync frequency**: Schedule syncs on a time-based interval or with a cron expression. The minimum supported interval is 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following requirements before you connect Jira as a data pipeline source.

- A Jira Cloud, Jira Server, or Jira Data Center instance with API access enabled.
- The hostname for your Jira instance. For example, `workato.atlassian.net`.
- Read access to the objects you plan to sync.
- Credentials for your chosen authentication method. Refer to [Supported connection types](#supported-connection-types) for details.

### Required permissions

The connected Jira account must have permission to read the data you plan to sync. Jira enforces permissions at multiple levels, and missing permissions cause the pipeline to receive a `403 - Forbidden` response and skip the affected records.

The connected account must satisfy each of the following:

- **Project permissions**: The account must have the **Browse Projects** permission for every Jira project that contains data you plan to sync. Permissions are granted through permission schemes assigned to each project. Refer to the Atlassian [permissions guide](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/jira-permissions-made-simple-717062767.html) for more information.
- **Issue security levels**: If a project uses an issue security scheme, the account must be a member of the security levels assigned to the issues you plan to sync. Issues at security levels the account can't access are excluded from extraction.
- **Application access**: The account must have application access to the Jira product that contains the data. For example, reading the `Boards` object requires Jira Software application access.

## Supported connection types

Jira data pipelines support the following authentication methods. Select the corresponding value in the **Auth type** field when you create the connection.

- **API token**: Authenticate with an Atlassian API token. Select **API token** for a personal Atlassian account, or **Service account (API token)** for an Atlassian service account. Both options use the same setup procedure and the same fields. This method doesn't support on-premise Jira connections.
- **OAuth 2.0**: Authorize Workato access from your Jira account. Select **OAuth 2.0 (Cloud - Atlassian-hosted Jira)** for Jira Cloud, or **OAuth 2.0 (Data Center)** for on-premise Jira. The Data Center option additionally requires you to generate a client ID and client secret in Jira and provide them in Workato.
- **Personal access token**: Authenticate with a personal access token (PAT) generated in your Jira account. This method supports on-premise Jira connections.
- **Basic authentication with password**: Authenticate with a username and password. Atlassian deprecated this method for cloud connections in December 2018.

> **AUTHENTICATION LIMITATIONS**
> 
> The Jira authentication methods have the following limitations:
> 
> - API token authentication doesn't support on-premise Jira connections.
> - Basic authentication with password is deprecated for Jira Cloud and supports on-premise Jira only.

## Connect to Jira

There are six ways to connect to Jira:

- [API token](#api-token)
- [Service account (API token)](#service-account-api-token)
- [OAuth 2.0 (Cloud - Atlassian-hosted Jira)](#oauth-2-0-cloud)
- [OAuth 2.0 (Data Center)](#oauth-2-0-data-center)
- [Personal access tokens](#personal-access-tokens)
- [Basic authentication (password)](#basic-authentication-with-password)

We strongly recommend using API tokens, service account API tokens, OAuth 2.0, or personal access tokens to connect to Jira instead of basic authentication with a password.

> **LIMITATIONS**
> 
> Authentication methods for the Jira connector have the following limitations:
> 
> - Real-time triggers aren't supported with OAuth 2.0 (Cloud - Atlassian-hosted Jira) or OAuth 2.0 (Data Center).
> - On-prem Jira connections aren't supported with API token or service account (API token) authentication.
> - Atlassian deprecated basic authentication for cloud connections in December 2018. On-premise Jira is not affected.

3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from Jira.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **Jira**.
   
7. Choose the Jira connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel.
   
   ![Add objects](/assets/add-objects-jira.C2UcQPqK.png)_Add objects_
   
9. Search or browse the list of available Jira objects, select the objects you plan to sync, and click **Add**. Refer to [Supported objects](#supported-objects) for more information.
   
   ![Select objects](/assets/select-objects-jira.Gng420ED.png)_Select objects_
   
10. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. When you select an object, the pipeline automatically fetches its schema, including standard fields and custom fields configured in your Jira instance, to ensure the destination matches the source.
    
    Expand any object to view its fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication. Primary key fields, such as `id`, can't be deselected.
    
    ![Expand object](/assets/expand-objects-jira.CRwPVyld.png)_Expand object_
    
11. Optional. Configure field-level data masking by selecting the icon next to each field and choosing how to handle the field:
    
    - **Replicate as is**: Data values at the source replicate identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the field before syncing to your destination.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive fields.
    
12. Click **Add object** again to add more objects. Repeat this step to include additional Jira objects in your pipeline.
    
13. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
14. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from Jira to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    

## Supported objects

Jira data pipelines sync data from Jira REST API resources. Each object you select syncs as a separate table in your destination. The objects available for selection depend on your Jira instance configuration. For example, Jira Software products expose additional objects such as boards.

Available objects include the following:

- `Issues`: Issue records, including standard fields and any custom fields configured in your Jira instance.
- `Projects`: Jira project records.
- `Users`: Jira user records.
- `Boards`: Boards from Jira Software products.
- `Fields`: Field metadata, including custom field definitions.

## Sync modes

Jira data pipelines support full refresh and incremental sync.

### Full refresh

A full refresh sync reads all available records from Jira for the selected object and overwrites the destination table. Use full refresh for objects where you need a complete snapshot on each run.

### Incremental sync

An incremental sync extracts only records that have changed since the last successful run.

## Schema and data type handling

The following considerations apply to schema and data types when you sync data from Jira.

### Custom fields

The pipeline automatically discovers custom fields configured on Jira objects and includes them in the schema alongside standard fields. For example, the `Issues` object includes standard fields such as `id`, `key`, and `Resolution` together with any custom fields configured on issues in your Jira instance. Deselect individual custom fields to exclude them from extraction and schema replication.

### Primary keys

Each object has a primary key field that can't be deselected. For example, `id` is the primary key for the `Issues` object.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use Jira as a data pipeline source.

### Authentication method limitations

The following authentication limitations apply:

- API token authentication doesn't support on-premise Jira connections.
- Basic authentication with password is deprecated for Jira Cloud and supports on-premise Jira only.

### Minimum sync frequency

The minimum supported sync interval is 15 minutes.
