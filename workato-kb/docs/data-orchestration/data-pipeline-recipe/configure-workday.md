# Configure Workday as a data pipeline source

Set up Workday as a data pipeline source to extract business object records from your Workday tenant and sync to your destination. Use this guide to set up a connection, configure your pipeline, add objects, review sync behavior, and understand known limitations.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use Workday as a pipeline source:

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication | Supports OAuth 2.0 and basic authentication. OAuth 2.0 is required to work with custom objects and Workday Query Language (WQL). Refer to [Supported connection types](#supported-connection-types) for more information. |
| Object selection | Select individual Workday business objects to sync as objects in your pipeline. Refer to [Supported objects](#supported-objects) for more information. |
| Field-level data protection | Configure each field to replicate values as-is or hash sensitive values before syncing to the destination. Refer to [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) for more information. |
| Schema drift detection and handling | Detect and apply schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or keep the schema fixed with **Block new fields**. |
| Configurable sync frequency | Schedule syncs on a time-based interval or with a custom cron expression. The minimum supported interval is 15 minutes. |
| Full refresh and incremental sync | Supports full refresh and incremental sync modes. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information. |
| Delete tracking | Captures record deletions from Workday through a `Workato Is Deleted` flag on each record. Refer to [Schema and data type handling](#schema-and-data-type-handling) for more information. |

## Prerequisites

Complete the following requirements before you connect Workday as a data pipeline source.

- A Workday tenant you can administer, or admin access.
- An Integration System User (ISU) configured in Workday with the permissions required to read the business objects you plan to sync. Refer to [Register an Integration System User (ISU) in Workday](/en/connectors/workday#connection-setup) in the Workday connector documentation for setup steps.
- A registered API client for integrations in Workday with a non-expiring refresh token, and the client ID, client secret, authorization endpoint, and token endpoint values from the API client settings, if you plan to use OAuth 2.0.
- The ISU login name and password, if you plan to use basic authentication.
- Your Workday tenant ID, WSDL URL, and the Workday tenant timezone.

> **WORKDAY SETUP**
> 
> You must complete the Workday-side setup for your authentication method before you create the connection in Workato. Refer to the [Workday connector documentation](/en/connectors/workday#connection-setup) for the full ISU registration, security group, domain access, and API client setup procedures.

## Supported connection types

Workday pipelines support cloud and on-prem connections, with OAuth 2.0 or basic authentication.

### Connection type

Workato reaches your Workday tenant through one of the following routes:

- **Cloud**: Connect directly from Workato's cloud to your Workday tenant.
- **On-prem group**: Connect through an on-prem group when network or security policy requires it.

### Authentication type

The authentication type determines whether the pipeline can access custom objects and Workday Query Language (WQL) data, and how the connection authenticates against your tenant.

- **OAuth 2.0**: Authenticate through a registered API client for integrations in Workday using a non-expiring refresh token. OAuth 2.0 is required to work with custom objects and WQL.
- **Basic authentication**: Authenticate with the ISU login name and password. Custom objects and WQL aren't available with this type.

## Connect to Workday

Complete the following steps to connect Workday as a data pipeline source. Select the tab that matches the authentication type you plan to use.

Connect to Workday

**OAuth 2.0**

1. Select **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `Workday` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name in the **Connection name** field.
   
   ![Configure your Workday connection](/assets/configure-workday-connection-oauth.CBpiqpm9.png)_Configure your Workday connection_
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Use the **Connection type** drop-down menu to select **Cloud**.
   
6. Select **OAuth 2.0** in the **Authentication type** field. This method is required to work with custom objects and to query data using Workday Query Language (WQL) with the Workday REST API.
   
7. Enter your Workday tenant ID in the **Tenant ID** field. Your tenant ID is the value that appears in the URL when you log in to Workday. For example, in `https://impl.workday.com/sample_company/d/home.htmld`, the tenant ID is `sample_company`.
   
8. Enter your Workday WSDL URL in the **WSDL URL** field. For example, `https://wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx/service/`.
   
9. Enter the client ID from your Workday API client settings in the **Client ID** field.
   
10. Enter the client secret from your Workday API client settings in the **Client secret** field.
    
11. Enter your non-expiring refresh token in the **Refresh token** field. Refer to [Generate a non-expiring refresh token](/en/connectors/workday#register-api-client) for steps.
    
12. Enter the authorization endpoint from your Workday API client settings in the **Authorization endpoint** field.
    
13. Enter the token endpoint from your Workday API client settings in the **Token endpoint** field.
    
14. Use the **Workday tenant timezone** drop-down menu to select the timezone configured in your Workday tenant. Workday returns data effective from the current day in PST by default. Selecting a timezone ensures retrieved data is consistent with your tenant.
    
15. Optional. Expand **Advanced settings** to configure the **Advanced XML payload for multiple ID values**.
    
    Workato wraps each value in fields with multiple values within its own container by default when constructing the XML from your input.
    
    For example:
    
    ```
    <languages><language>english</language></languages><languages><language>chinese</language></languages>
    ```
    
    Workato unwraps these values and presents them in a single container if you set the value to **Yes**:
    
    ```
    <languages><language>english</language><language>chinese</language></languages>
    ```
    
    Consider enabling this when you encounter invalid payload errors.
    
16. Use the **Workday web services version** drop-down menu to select the API version you plan to use. Defaults to `45.1`. Refer to [API version](/en/connectors/workday#api-version) for the supported version list and version support policy.
    
17. Select **Connect** to verify and save the connection.
    

**Basic authentication**

5. Use the **Connection type** drop-down menu to select **Cloud**.
   
6. Use the **Authentication type** drop-down menu to select **Basic**.
   
7. Enter your Workday tenant ID in the **Tenant ID** field.
   
8. Enter your Workday WSDL URL in the **WSDL URL** field.
   
9. Enter the ISU login name in the **Login name** field.
   
10. Enter the ISU password in the **Password** field.
    
11. Use the **Workday tenant timezone** drop-down menu to select the timezone configured in your Workday tenant.
    
12. Optional. Expand **Advanced settings** to configure the **Advanced XML payload for multiple ID values**.
    
    Workato wraps each value in fields with multiple values within its own container by default when constructing the XML from your input.
    
    For example:
    
    ```
    <languages><language>english</language></languages><languages><language>chinese</language></languages>
    ```
    
    Workato unwraps these values and presents them in a single container if you set the value to **Yes**:
    
    ```
    <languages><language>english</language><language>chinese</language></languages>
    ```
    
    Consider enabling this setting if you encounter invalid payload errors.
    
13. Use the **Workday web services version** drop-down menu to select the API version you plan to use. Defaults to `45.1`.

## Configure the pipeline

Complete the following steps to configure Workday as your data pipeline source:

1. Select **Create > Data pipeline** or press C+I.
   
2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from Workday.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **Workday**.
   
7. Choose the Workday connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel.
   
   ![Add objects](/assets/add-objects-workday.BAZPfRsR.png)_Add objects_
   
9. Search or browse the list of available Workday objects, select the objects you plan to sync, and click **Add**.
   
10. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. When you select an object, the pipeline automatically fetches its schema to ensure the destination matches the source.
    
    ![Review schema](/assets/review-schema-workday.BChWTXUu.png)_Review schema_
    
    Expand any object to view its fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication.
    
11. Optional. Configure field-level data protection by expanding an object and choosing how to handle each field:
    
    - **Replicate as is**: Data values at the source replicate identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the field before syncing to your destination.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive fields.
    
12. Click **Add object** again to add more objects. Repeat this step to include additional Workday objects in your pipeline.
    
13. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
14. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from Workday to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    The historical start date applies to objects that support an API-level filter.
    

## Supported objects

Workday pipelines sync data from business objects exposed through the Workday Web Services API. Workato discovers the available objects when you select **Add object** during pipeline configuration. The picker reflects what's available for your Workday tenant. Additional objects may appear depending on your tenant configuration and authentication type, including custom objects and WQL-backed objects when you connect with OAuth 2.0.

## Sync modes

Workday data pipelines support full refresh and incremental sync.

### Full refresh

A full refresh sync reads all available records for the object on every pipeline run and overwrites the destination. Use full refresh for objects when you need a complete snapshot of the data on each sync.

### Incremental sync

An incremental sync fetches only records that are new or changed since the last successful sync run.

## Schema and data type handling

Workday pipelines deliver standard business object data as a JSON document rather than flattening the underlying structure into individual columns. Parse the JSON column in your destination to work with specific Workday fields downstream. The JSON field is included by default. You can deselect the JSON field to remove the record content from sync, leaving only the identifier and metadata fields.

Each standard object also includes a primary key for the Workday record identifier, an optional descriptor field, and a `Workato Is Deleted` flag that you can use to identify deleted records.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use Workday as a data pipeline source:

### Minimum sync frequency

The minimum supported sync interval is 15 minutes.

### Authentication type affects object availability

Custom objects and WQL-backed objects require OAuth 2.0 authentication. These objects aren't available when you connect with basic authentication.

### API version support

Workato supports a limited set of Workday Web Services API versions. Connections using removed versions are automatically upgraded to the earliest available version. Refer to [Version support policy](/en/connectors/workday#api-version) for more information.
