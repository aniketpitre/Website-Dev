# Configure Confluence as a data pipeline source

Set up Confluence as a data pipeline source to extract spaces, pages, blog posts, comments, and related content from Confluence and sync them to your destination. Use this guide to prepare your Confluence credentials, connect Confluence to Workato, configure the pipeline, and understand the supported objects, sync modes, and limitations.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use Confluence as a pipeline source:

- **Confluence Cloud connectivity**: Connects to your Confluence Cloud site over https.
- **Full sync and incremental sync**: Pages, blog posts, comments, and attachments support incremental sync based on their last modified timestamps. Audit logs sync incrementally based on event creation time. Other objects use a full sync on each run.
- **Object-level selection**: Choose which Confluence objects to include in your pipeline.
- **Delete tracking**: Pages, blog posts, and attachments that are moved to the trash or deleted in Confluence are marked as deleted in your destination. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information.
- **Schema drift detection and handling**: Detect and apply schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or keep the schema fixed with **Block new fields**.
- **Field-level data protection**: Hash or replicate sensitive fields as is before the data reaches your destination.
- **Configurable sync frequency**: Schedule syncs on a time-based interval or with a cron expression. The minimum supported interval is 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from Confluence.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **Confluence**.
   
7. Choose the Confluence connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel.
   
   ![Add objects](/assets/add-objects-confluence.C14-0dnb.png)_Add objects_
   
9. Search or browse the list of available Confluence objects, select the objects you plan to sync, and click **Add**.
   
   > **SYNC MODE DEFAULTS**
   > 
   > Objects without a supported timestamp field sync in **Full sync** mode. Pages, blog posts, comments, attachments, and audit logs support the **Incremental** sync mode. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
   
10. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. The pipeline automatically fetches the object schema you select to ensure the destination matches the source.
    
    Expand an object to view its fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude data from extraction and schema replication.
    
    ![Expand objects](/assets/expand-objects-confluence.ClI3q3wR.png)_Expand objects_
    
11. Optional. Configure field-level data protection by expanding an object and choosing how to handle each field:
    
    - **Replicate as is**: Data values at the source replicate identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the field before syncing to your destination.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive fields.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII), such as user display names and email addresses.
    
12. Click **Add object** again to add more objects. Repeat this step to include additional Confluence objects in your pipeline.
    
13. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
14. Optional. Enter a value in the **Concurrency limit** field to cap the number of concurrent operations. Leave the field blank to use the default quota set by Workato. The maximum value is `100`.
    
15. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from Confluence to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    

## Supported objects

Confluence data pipelines sync data from the Confluence Cloud REST API. The following tables list the supported objects, grouped by category. Each object syncs as a separate table in your destination.

### Content

| Object | Sync modes | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Spaces` (`space`) | Full sync | No |
| `Pages` (`page`) | Full sync, incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Page Versions` (`page_version`) | Full sync | N/A (append-only) |
| `Blog Posts` (`blogpost`) | Full sync, incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Blog Post Versions` (`blogpost_version`) | Full sync | N/A (append-only) |
| `Page Attachments` (`page_attachment`) | Full sync, incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Blog Post Attachments` (`blogpost_attachment`) | Full sync, incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Tasks` (`task`) | Full sync | No |

`Tasks` doesn't support incremental sync because the Confluence API doesn't provide a filter for task modification times. Tasks use a full sync on every run so that edits and completions are captured.

### Comments and labels

| Object | Sync modes | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Page Footer Comments` (`page_footer_comment`) | Full sync, incremental | No |
| `Page Inline Comments` (`page_inline_comment`) | Full sync, incremental | No |
| `Labels` (`label`) | Full sync | No |

Labels in Confluence are global tags shared across pages and blog posts. The `Labels` object syncs the full label catalog for your site rather than per-page label assignments.

### Users and groups

| Object | Sync modes | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Users` (`user`) | Full sync | Yes (flags deactivated accounts) |
| `Groups` (`group`) | Full sync | No |
| `Group Members` (`group_member`) | Full sync | No |

For the `Users` object, the `_workato_is_deleted` column marks accounts that are no longer active in Atlassian, such as deactivated accounts, rather than deleted records.

### Administration and properties

| Object | Sync modes | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Space Permissions` (`space_permission`) | Full sync | No |
| `Page Restrictions` (`page_restriction`) | Full sync | No |
| `Audit Logs` (`audit_log`) | Incremental | N/A (append-only) |
| `Content Properties` (`content_property`) | Full sync | No |
| `Space Properties` (`space_property`) | Full sync | No |
| `Templates` (`template`) | Full sync | No |

`Audit Logs` returns data only when the connection authenticates as a Confluence site administrator. Connections without site administrator access receive a permissions error for this object.

## Sync modes

Confluence data pipelines support full sync and incremental sync. The sync mode is configured per object when you add it to your pipeline. If no timestamp is detected for an object, the sync mode defaults to **Full sync**.

### Full sync

A full sync reads all available records from Confluence for the selected object and overwrites the destination table. Use a full sync for objects where you need a complete snapshot on each run. Because each full sync replaces the destination table, deletions in Confluence are reflected for all objects that sync in this mode.

### Incremental sync

An incremental sync extracts only records that have changed since the last successful run. Workato uses last modified timestamps as the incremental cursor for content objects, such as pages, blog posts, comments, and attachments, and event creation time for `Audit Logs`.

Delete tracking during incremental sync is supported for `Pages`, `Blog Posts`, `Page Attachments`, and `Blog Post Attachments`. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information.

Refer to the [Supported objects](#supported-objects) tables to see the sync modes each object supports.

### Delete tracking

Confluence doesn't provide a change stream for deletions, so the pipeline detects deletions by listing trashed and deleted content directly.

Records for `Pages`, `Blog Posts`, `Page Attachments`, and `Blog Post Attachments` that are moved to the trash or deleted in Confluence sync to the destination with the synthetic `_workato_is_deleted` column set to `true`. Archived content is not treated as deleted: archived records keep `_workato_is_deleted` as `false` and carry the value `archived` in their `status` column.

The following behaviors apply to delete tracking:

- **Deleted records re-sync on every incremental run**: Confluence doesn't expose a deletion timestamp, so each incremental run re-extracts the full set of trashed and deleted records, even when no records changed. Extracted and loaded counts are equal on most runs. The loaded count can be slightly lower when the same record appears more than once in a single run, for example, when both the modified-date pass and the deletion sweep surface the same record. The destination deduplicates these records by ID.
- **Comment deletions are not detected**: The Confluence API doesn't expose deleted comments, so comment deletions can't sync to the destination.
- **Historical deletions are excluded from bounded initial loads**: If you set a start date in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field, the initial load includes only deletions that occurred within that window. Deletions after the initial load are tracked normally.

## Schema and data type handling

The following schema behaviors apply when you sync Confluence data.

### Nested fields

Nested objects in Confluence API responses, such as version metadata, sync as string columns containing JSON. Top-level metadata, such as `id`, `status`, `title`, `space_id`, `parent_id`, and `created_at`, syncs as scalar columns.

### Page hierarchy

Confluence pages are hierarchical. Each page record carries a `parent_id` column that identifies its parent page. Join records on `parent_id` in your destination to reconstruct the page tree.

### Synthetic columns

Workato adds the following synthetic column to destination tables for specific objects:

| Column | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_workato_is_deleted` | Boolean | Marks records that were trashed or deleted in Confluence. Applies to `Pages`, `Blog Posts`, `Page Attachments`, and `Blog Post Attachments`. For `Users`, this column marks accounts that are no longer active in Atlassian. |

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use Confluence as a data pipeline source:

### Attachment metadata only

Attachment objects sync metadata only. The pipeline doesn't download binary file content, such as the attached documents or images themselves.

### API token expiry

Atlassian API tokens expire one year after creation. Generate a new token and update your connection before expiry to avoid authentication failures.

### Minimum sync frequency

The minimum supported sync interval is 15 minutes.
