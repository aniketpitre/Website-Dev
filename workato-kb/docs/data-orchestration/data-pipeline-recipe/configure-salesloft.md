# Configure Salesloft as a data pipeline source

Set up Salesloft as a data pipeline source to extract and sync sales engagement records, such as people, accounts, cadences, and call and email activity, into your destination.

Use this guide to generate Salesloft credentials, set up a connection, configure your pipeline, add objects, review sync behavior, and understand known limitations.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use Salesloft as a pipeline source:

- **Cloud connectivity**: Connect to Salesloft over HTTPS through a single global endpoint, `https://api.salesloft.com`. On-prem agents aren't required.
- **Two authentication methods**: Connect with an API key or an OAuth 2.0 (authorization code grant) connection. Refer to [Supported connection types](#supported-connection-types) for more information.
- **Full sync and incremental sync**: Most objects sync incrementally using each record's `updated_at` timestamp. Objects that don't expose a filterable timestamp sync in full by default. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
- **Object-level selection**: Select Salesloft objects to sync as separate tables in your destination. Refer to [Supported objects](#supported-objects) for the full list.
- **Derived join key columns**: For fields that reference another record, such as an `Opportunities` record's `owner`, the pipeline adds a scalar `<field>_id` column alongside the original JSON reference so you can join tables without parsing JSON. Refer to [Primary keys and relationships](#primary-keys-and-relationships) for more information.
- **GDPR-aware compliance fields**: The `People` object's `eu_resident` and `do_not_contact` fields sync unmasked so you can apply compliance-driven handling downstream. Refer to [Sensitive data handling](#sensitive-data-handling) for more information.
- **Schema drift detection and handling**: Detect and apply schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or keep the schema fixed with **Block new fields**.
- **Field-level data protection**: Hash or replicate sensitive fields as is before the data reaches your destination.
- **Configurable sync frequency**: Schedule syncs on a time-based interval or with a cron expression. The minimum supported interval is 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Connecting Salesloft as a data pipeline source requires:

- A Salesloft account
- Credentials for your chosen authentication method:
  - **API key**: A personal API key generated from your Salesloft account settings. Refer to [Generate a Salesloft API key](#generate-a-salesloft-api-key) for setup steps.
  - **OAuth 2.0 (authorization code grant)**: A Salesloft OAuth application registered with the **Authorization Code** grant type, and a Salesloft user account with permission to authorize the application. Refer to [Register a Salesloft OAuth application](#register-a-salesloft-oauth-application) for setup steps.

> **REQUIRED PERMISSIONS**
> 
> API key authentication scopes must be selected when you create it the API key. Refer to [Recommended scopes](#recommended-scopes) for the scopes that map to each Workato object.

## Register a Salesloft OAuth application

You must register an OAuth application in Salesloft and create a Workato custom OAuth profile before you create a connection to Salesloft using OAuth 2.0 (authorization code grant). Skip this section if you connect with an API key.

1. Go to **Tools > Custom OAuth profiles** in Workato and click **\+ New custom profile**.
   
2. Select **Salesloft** as the connector.
   
3. Enter a name for the profile in the **Name** field, then click **Create new app**.
   
4. Sign in to your [Salesloft account](https://accounts.salesloft.com/) in a separate browser tab and go to **Your Applications > OAuth Applications > Create New**. Keep the Workato tab open.
   
5. Enter a name for the application in the **Name** field and a description in the **Description** field.
   
6. Provide the Workato callback URL for your data center in the **Redirect URL** field. For example, `https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback`. Refer to [Callback URL](/en/developing-connectors/registering-new-client#callback-url) for more information.
   
7. Select **No** in the application type field to indicate the application is for internal use only.
   
8. Select **Authorization Code** in the **Grant type** field.
   
9. Select the scopes your pipeline needs by clicking the checkmark next to each scope. Refer to [Recommended scopes](#recommended-scopes) for the scopes that map to each Workato object.
   
   ![Salesloft scopes](/assets/scopes.BCWZ4kEs.png)_Salesloft scopes_
   
10. Click **Submit**, then copy the **Application ID** (Client ID) and **Secret** (Client secret) from the **App Credentials** section of the application.
    
11. Return to the Workato tab and enter the values you copied in the **Client ID** and **Client secret** fields.
    
12. Click **Save** to save the custom OAuth profile. Refer to [Custom OAuth profiles](/en/custom-oauth-profiles) for more information.
    

## Generate a Salesloft API key

You must generate an API key in Salesloft before you create the connection in Workato. Skip this section if you connect with an OAuth 2.0 (authorization code grant) connection.

1. Sign in to your [Salesloft account](https://accounts.salesloft.com/) and go to **Your Applications > API Keys > Create New**.
   
2. Enter a descriptive name for the key in the **Name** field.
   
3. Select the scopes the key needs. Refer to [Recommended scopes](#recommended-scopes) for the scopes that map to each Workato object. Salesloft disables **Save** until you select at least one scope.
   
4. Click **Save**.
   
5. Copy the generated key. You need this value to create the Workato connection. Salesloft keys are prefixed `ak_` and aren't displayed again after you leave the confirmation screen.
   

> **API KEY SCOPES**
> 
> Like an OAuth application, an API key carries the scopes you select when you create it. Grant the same scopes listed in [Recommended scopes](#recommended-scopes), including both `email_contents` and `email_bodies` if you plan to sync the `subject` and `body` fields on `Emails`.

## Recommended scopes

Grant the following scopes when you register your OAuth application or generate your API key. The scopes are identical for both methods.

| Salesloft scope | Workato objects |
| --- | --- |
| `people:read` | `People`, `PersonStages` |
| `accounts:read` | `Accounts`, `AccountStages`, `AccountTiers` |
| `opportunities:read` | `Opportunities`, `OpportunityTag` |
| `team:read` | `Users`, `Teams`, `Tags`, `Groups` |
| `cadences:read` | `Cadences`, `CadenceMemberships`, `Steps`, `Actions` |
| `calls:read` | `Calls`, `CallDispositions`, `CallSentiments` |
| `emails:read`, `email_contents`, `email_bodies` | `Emails`, `EmailTemplates` |
| `notes:read` | `Notes` |
| `tasks:read` | `Tasks` |
| `crm:read` | `CRMActivities`, `CRMUsers` |
| `meetings:read` | `Meetings` |
| `activities:read` | `Successes` |
| `workflow:read` | `Imports`, `CustomFields` |

> **EMAIL CONTENT SCOPES**
> 
> Grant both `email_contents` and `email_bodies` together. A connection missing either scope fails to sync the entire `Emails` object with a `Requested scoped field(s) could not be returned, required scope access not included` error, rather than silently omitting the `subject`, `body`, and `error_message` fields.

## Supported connection types

Salesloft data pipelines support two authentication methods:

- **API key**: Provide a personal API key generated from your Salesloft account. Refer to [Generate a Salesloft API key](#generate-a-salesloft-api-key) for setup steps.
- **OAuth 2.0 (authorization code grant)**: Authorize Workato using a custom OAuth profile built from a Salesloft OAuth application that you create. Salesloft data pipelines don't support a default Workato-managed app, so you must register your own OAuth application and create a custom OAuth profile before you connect. Refer to [Register a Salesloft OAuth application](#register-a-salesloft-oauth-application) for setup steps.

Salesloft doesn't support Basic authentication or SCIM tokens for data pipelines.

## Connect to Salesloft

Complete the following steps to connect to Salesloft:

Connect to Salesloft

**API key**

1. Select **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `Salesloft` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name in the **Connection name** field.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Select **API key** in the **Authentication type** field.
   
6. Paste the key you generated into the **API key** field.
   
7. Select **Connect** to verify and save the connection. Workato displays a success message when the connection is established.
   

**OAuth 2.0 (authorization code grant)**

2. Search for `Salesloft` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name in the **Connection name** field.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Select **OAuth 2.0 (authorization code grant)** in the **Authentication type** field.
   
6. Use the **Custom OAuth profile** drop-down menu to select the [custom OAuth profile](#register-a-salesloft-oauth-application) you created for Salesloft. Salesloft data pipelines don't support a default Workato-managed app, so this field is required.
   
7. Select **Connect**. Workato redirects you to Salesloft to authorize the application.
   
8. Follow Salesloft's prompts to sign in and authorize Workato. Salesloft redirects you back to Workato and displays a success message when the connection is established.
   

## Configure the pipeline

Complete the following steps to configure Salesloft as your data pipeline source:

1. Select **Create > Data pipeline** or press C+I.
   
2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from Salesloft.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **Salesloft**.
   
7. Choose the Salesloft connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel.
   
   ![Add objects](/assets/add-objects-salesloft.DktXDj03.png)_Add objects_
   
9. Search or browse the list of available Salesloft objects, select the objects you plan to sync, and click **Add**.
   
   > **SYNC MODES**
   > 
   > Objects that don't support incremental sync re-extract all records on every run. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
   
10. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. The pipeline automatically fetches an object's schema when you select it. This ensures the destination matches the source.
    
    Expand an object to view associated fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication.
    
11. Optional. Configure the sync mode for an object:
    
    1. Click the **Settings** (gear) icon next to the object.
       
    2. Select a **Sync mode**:
       
       - **Incremental**: Sync only new and updated records.
       - **Full sync**: Reload all records on each run.
       
       Workato defaults to **Full sync** and disables this field if Salesloft doesn't expose a usable timestamp on the object.
       
    3. Click **Save**.
       
12. Optional. Configure field-level data protection by expanding an object and choosing how to handle each field:
    
    - **Replicate as is**: Data values at the source replicate identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the field before syncing to your destination.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive fields. Refer to [Sensitive data handling](#sensitive-data-handling) for a list of fields that commonly contain PII.
    
13. Click **Add object** again to add more objects. Repeat this step to include additional Salesloft objects in your pipeline.
    
14. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
15. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from Salesloft to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    

## Supported objects

Salesloft data pipelines sync data from Salesloft REST API v2 resources. The following tables list the supported objects, grouped by category. Each object syncs as a separate table in your destination.

### People and accounts

| Object | Sync modes | Delete tracking | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Sync modes

Salesloft data pipelines support full sync and incremental sync. The pipeline defaults each object to a sync mode, which you can change unless the object has no usable timestamp. Refer to [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) for the per-object **Sync mode** setting.

### Full sync

Full sync extracts all available records for an object on every run and updates your destination table to match. If a previously synced record no longer appears in a run, Workato flags it as deleted rather than removing it. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information.

The first run of every object performs a full sync, starting from the date you set in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field for objects that support it. The pipeline extracts all available records if you leave the field blank.

Objects whose Salesloft endpoint doesn't support filtering by an update timestamp sync in full. Refer to the [Supported objects](#supported-objects) tables to see the sync mode for each object.

### Incremental sync

After the first sync completes, the pipeline extracts only records created or updated since the last successful run, using each record's `updated_at` timestamp as the cursor.

Refer to the [Supported objects](#supported-objects) tables to see the sync mode for each object.

### Delete tracking

For objects that sync in full, Workato compares each run against the destination table and flags a record with `_workato_is_deleted = true` if it no longer appears in Salesloft, rather than removing the row. For objects that sync incrementally, Workato can't detect deletions, because Salesloft doesn't expose deleted records to a read client. A deleted record remains in your destination with its last-synced values.

`Meetings` is the only object with a source-driven delete signal. Salesloft's API directly reports cancelled and deleted meetings, so the pipeline sets `_workato_is_deleted` from that signal instead of inferring it from a missing row. Refer to [Synthetic columns](#synthetic-columns) for more information.

`Accounts`, `Cadences`, and `EmailTemplates` treat archival as a status change rather than a delete, so an archived record stays in your destination. Refer to the [Supported objects](#supported-objects) tables to see delete tracking by object.

## Schema and data type handling

The following considerations apply to schema and data types when you sync data from Salesloft:

### Primary keys and relationships

Each destination table uses the Salesloft record `id` as its primary key, except `OpportunityTag`. Salesloft doesn't have a dedicated endpoint for `OpportunityTag`, so the pipeline derives one row per tag from the `tags` array embedded in each `Opportunities` record, using a composite key of `opportunity_id` and `tag_name`.

Relationships to other records sync as embedded JSON reference columns, such as `account` on `People`. The pipeline also adds a scalar `<field>_id` column derived from the same response alongside most of these reference columns, such as `account_id` on `People`. Both columns sync independently, so you can select only the scalar ID column to use as a join key and deselect the full JSON reference to reduce storage, or keep both.

### Custom fields

Salesloft lets customers define custom fields on `People`, `Accounts`, and `Opportunities`. These sync as a single `custom_fields` JSON column rather than as individual columns, because the set of custom fields varies by Salesloft workspace. Refer to the `CustomFields` object for the custom field definitions in your workspace.

Workato syncs JSON fields to the destination's native JSON type, such as `VARIANT` in Snowflake. Workato serializes JSON fields as strings if the destination doesn't support a native JSON type.

### Tags

The `tags` field on `People` and `Accounts` returns a plain JSON array of tag name strings. These values can't be joined to the `Tags` object by a foreign key, because Salesloft doesn't return a tag ID reference on `People` or `Accounts`.

### Timestamps

Salesloft timestamps sync as timestamp with time zone values and preserve the source's ISO 8601 UTC format.

### Nested fields

Fields that contain nested objects, such as an `Emails` record's engagement `counts`, sync as JSON in a single column.

### Call recordings

Each entry in the `recordings` array on `Calls` includes a `url` field that points to a time-limited, presigned URL for the call recording audio. The pipeline syncs this URL as metadata only and doesn't fetch or store the audio content.

### Synthetic columns

Workato adds the following synthetic column to the destination table of every object that syncs in full:

| Column | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_workato_is_deleted` | Boolean | Set to `true` for a record that no longer appears in a full sync. For `Meetings`, this value comes directly from Salesloft's cancelled and deleted meetings signal instead of a missing row. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information. |

### Sensitive data handling

Salesloft objects can contain significant personally identifiable information (PII). The following objects commonly contain sensitive fields:

| Object | Sensitive fields |
| --- | --- |
| `People` | `first_name`, `last_name`, `email_address`, `personal_email_address`, `phone`, `home_phone`, `mobile_phone`, `linkedin_url` |
| `Accounts` | `name`, `domain`, `website`, `phone` |
| `Users` | `name`, `email` |
| `Calls` | `to`, embedded `called_person` and note data, `recordings[].url` |
| `Emails` | `recipient_email_address`, embedded user and recipient data, `subject`, `body`, `error_message` |
| `Notes` | Free-text `content`, which may contain any PII shared in a sales conversation |

> **GDPR COMPLIANCE FIELDS**
> 
> `People` includes an `eu_resident` boolean field that flags GDPR-scoped records, and a `do_not_contact` boolean field that flags opt-out requests. The pipeline doesn't mask or exclude either field, because downstream systems rely on both as compliance signals. Workato recommends applying the **Hash** option to other PII fields on `People` records where `eu_resident` is `true`.

Use the **Hash** option in field-level data protection during pipeline configuration to protect PII before it reaches your destination. Refer to the [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) steps for more information.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use Salesloft as a data pipeline source:

### Deleted records on incremental objects

The pipeline can't detect deletions for objects that sync incrementally, because Salesloft doesn't expose deleted records to a read client. A record deleted in Salesloft remains in your destination with its last-synced values until you run a full sync of that object. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for the objects this affects.

### Meetings availability depends on your Salesloft plan

The `Meetings` object isn't available on every Salesloft plan. If your plan doesn't include Meetings API access, the pipeline reports a permission error for `Meetings` but continues syncing your other selected objects.

### Email content requires additional permissions

Syncing the `subject`, `body`, and `error_message` fields on `Emails` requires both the `email_contents` and `email_bodies` scopes, whether you connect with an OAuth application or an API key. A connection missing either scope fails to sync the entire `Emails` object rather than omitting those fields silently.

### Minimum sync frequency

The minimum supported sync interval is 15 minutes.
