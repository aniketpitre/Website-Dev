# Configure Facebook as a data pipeline source

Set up Facebook as a data pipeline source to extract and sync ad account, campaign, and performance insights data from the Meta Marketing API to your destination.

Use this guide to review the features and prerequisites, connect Facebook as a data pipeline source, configure the pipeline, and understand the supported objects, sync modes, schema handling, sensitive data handling, and known limitations.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use Facebook as a pipeline source:

- **Cloud connectivity**: Connects to the Meta Marketing API over HTTPS through `https://graph.facebook.com`.
- **Multi-account support**: Sync all ad accounts your connection can access, or select specific ad accounts by ID.
- **Object-level selection**: Choose from supported objects across the ad hierarchy and performance insights reports. Refer to [Supported objects](#supported-objects) for the full list.
- **Incremental sync**: `AdSet`, `Ad`, and all performance insights objects sync incrementally. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
- **Delete tracking**: Detect archived, deleted, or missing records on every full-sync object, plus `AdSet` and `Ad`, and mark them with a soft-delete flag in your destination. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information.
- **Schema drift detection and handling**: Detect and apply schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or keep the schema fixed with **Block new fields**.
- **Field-level data protection**: Hash or replicate sensitive fields as is before the data reaches your destination.
- **Configurable sync frequency**: Schedule syncs on a time-based interval or with a cron expression. The minimum supported interval is 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following requirements before you connect Facebook as a data pipeline source.

- A Meta Business Manager account with access to the ad accounts you plan to sync.
- A Facebook account with permission to authorize third-party applications for those ad accounts.

> **REQUIRED PERMISSIONS**
> 
> Workato requires the `ads_read` permission to sync Facebook objects. If you also want to sync the `AdAccount` object's `funding_source_details` field, grant the `business_management` permission. Without it, Workato skips that field and logs a warning rather than failing the sync.

## Supported connection types

Facebook data pipelines support OAuth 2.0 authentication:

- **OAuth 2.0**: Authorize Workato through Facebook Login, using the same OAuth flow as the Facebook Lead Ads workflow connector. Meta invalidates the resulting access token if you change your password, enable two-factor authentication, or remove Workato's app permissions. Reconnect the pipeline connection if that happens.

## Connect to Facebook

Complete the following steps to connect Facebook as a data pipeline source.

Connect to Facebook

1. Select **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `Facebook` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name in the **Connection name** field.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Optional. Use the **Custom OAuth profile** drop-down menu to select a custom OAuth profile for your connection.
   
6. Select **Connect** to open Facebook's login window.
   
7. Enter your credentials in the Facebook login window to authenticate your account.
   
8. Review the permissions that Workato requests, then select **Continue** to approve them and complete the connection. Workato displays a success message when the connection is established.
   

## Configure the pipeline

Complete the following steps to configure Facebook as your data pipeline source:

1. Select **Create > Data pipeline** or press C+I.
   
2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from Facebook.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **Facebook**.
   
7. Choose the Facebook connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Use the **Sync all ad accounts** drop-down menu to choose whether the pipeline discovers and syncs data from every ad account reachable by the authorized Facebook user. Select **Yes** to sync every accessible ad account automatically.
   
   If you select **No**, use the **Ad accounts to sync** field to choose specific accounts to sync. Select **Select from list** to pick accounts from a list, or toggle the field to enter ad account IDs as a comma-separated list instead.
   
   You can't change the **Sync all ad accounts** value after the pipeline's first run.
   
9. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel.
   
   ![Add Facebook objects](/assets/facebook-add-objects.y5RkEo7W.png)_Add Facebook objects_
   
10. Search or browse the list of available Facebook objects, select the objects you plan to sync, and click **Add**.
    
    ![Select Facebook objects](/assets/facebook-select-objects.CGOBN66A.png)_Select Facebook objects_
    
11. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. The pipeline automatically fetches an object's schema when you select it. This ensures the destination matches the source.
    
    Expand an object to view associated fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication.
    
12. Optional. Configure field-level data protection by expanding an object and choosing how to handle each field:
    
    - **Replicate as is**: Data values at the source replicate identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the field before syncing to your destination.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive fields. Refer to [Sensitive data handling](#sensitive-data-handling) for a list of fields that commonly contain PII.
    
13. Click **Add object** again to add more objects. Repeat this step to include additional Facebook objects in your pipeline.
    
14. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
15. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from Facebook to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    

## Supported objects

Facebook data pipelines sync data from the Meta Marketing API (v25.0). The following tables list the supported objects, grouped by category. Each object syncs as a separate table in your destination, except `Basic Ad Actions`, which merges Meta's `actions` and `action_values` arrays into a single child table of `Basic Ad`.

### Ad accounts and campaign hierarchy

The following objects mirror Meta's ad hierarchy: an `AdAccount` is the parent of `Campaign` objects, which are the parent of `AdSet` objects, which are the parent of `Ad` objects. Each `Ad` references an `AdCreative`.

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AdAccount` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) |
| `Campaign` | Full sync | Yes (soft) |
| `AdSet` | Incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Ad` | Incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `AdCreative` | Full sync | Yes (soft) |

### Creative assets, audiences, and labels

The following objects hold supporting creative assets and audience or label definitions referenced by ads, ad sets, and campaigns.

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AdImage` | Full sync | Yes (soft) |
| `AdVideo` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) |
| `CustomAudience` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) |
| `AdLabel` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) |

### Activity log

The following object is a change-history log for the other objects in the ad hierarchy.

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AdActivity` | Append-only | N/A |

### Prebuilt performance reports

The following objects return daily performance metrics at a fixed level (account, campaign, ad set, or ad). `Basic Ad Actions` is a child table of `Basic Ad` that expands each ad's conversion actions into one row per action type.

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Basic Ad` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Basic Ad Actions` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Basic AdSet` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Basic Campaign` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Basic Account` | Incremental | N/A |

### Demographic breakdowns and marketing mix modeling

The following objects return the same daily performance metrics broken down by an additional dimension, such as country or age and gender, or reduced to the minimal field set required for marketing mix modeling tools. `Demographics Platform & Device` surfaces the Facebook-versus-Instagram performance split, because Instagram ads sync through the same Marketing API objects rather than a separate connector.

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Demographics Country` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Demographics Region` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Demographics Age & Gender` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Demographics Platform & Device` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Marketing Mix Modeling` | Incremental | N/A |

## Sync modes

Facebook data pipelines support full sync, incremental sync, and append-only sync. Workato detects the sync mode for each object automatically.

### Full sync

A full sync re-reads the complete record set for an object on every run and overwrites the destination table. `AdAccount`, `Campaign`, `AdCreative`, `AdImage`, `AdVideo`, `CustomAudience`, and `AdLabel` use full sync, because Meta's API doesn't expose a reliable modified-time signal for these objects.

### Incremental sync

An incremental sync extracts only the records that changed since the last run. `AdSet` and `Ad` use Meta's `updated_time` field as a cursor.

All performance insights objects use a rolling date window instead of a modified-time cursor. Each run advances the window forward and re-fetches the trailing 28 days of data, so recent numbers can change between runs. This window is fixed at 28 days and isn't configurable.

Refer to the [Supported objects](#supported-objects) tables to see the sync mode for each object.

### Append-only sync

`AdActivity` is a change-history log for Meta's ad objects. Each run reads the account's activity history and adds new events to the destination without modifying or removing rows written by previous runs.

### Delete tracking

For `Campaign`, `AdSet`, and `Ad`, Workato detects soft-deleted records through Meta's `effective_status` field, but only for archived objects. Workato can detect an archived campaign, ad set, or ad, but not one that Meta has permanently deleted. For `AdCreative` and `AdImage`, Workato reads each record's own `status` field instead.

`AdAccount`, `AdVideo`, `CustomAudience`, and `AdLabel` sync in full on every run, so Workato detects deletions by comparing each run's complete snapshot against the previous one and flags records that no longer appear, even though Meta's API doesn't expose an explicit deletion signal for these objects.

Performance insights records are immutable once their date range passes, so delete tracking doesn't apply to them, and `AdActivity` is an append-only log that isn't deleted.

## Schema and data type handling

The following considerations apply to schema and data types when you sync data from Facebook.

### Timestamps

Facebook objects use different timestamp representations, and Workato handles each one differently:

- `AdAccount`, `Campaign`, `AdSet`, `Ad`, `AdCreative`, `AdImage`, `AdVideo`, and `AdActivity` return ISO 8601 timestamps with an embedded UTC offset. Workato normalizes these values to UTC when it writes them to your destination.
- `CustomAudience`'s `time_created`, `time_updated`, and `time_content_updated` fields return Unix epoch seconds instead of ISO 8601 strings. Workato detects and parses this format automatically.
- Performance insights objects return `date_start` and `date_stop` as calendar dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`) with no time component. Workato stores these as date values, not timestamps.

### Nested and variable fields

Facebook doesn't support user-defined custom fields, but several objects include fields whose structure varies by campaign objective or creative type. Workato stores the following fields as JSON columns instead of flattening them:

- `AdSet.targeting`
- `AdCreative.object_story_spec`
- `AdCreative.asset_feed_spec`
- `Campaign.promoted_object`

Workato syncs JSON fields to the destination's native JSON type, such as `VARIANT` in Snowflake. Workato serializes JSON fields as strings if the destination doesn't support a native JSON type.

### Synthetic columns

Workato adds the following synthetic column to destination tables for objects with delete tracking:

| Column | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_workato_is_deleted` | Boolean | Set to `true` for deleted or missing records on `Campaign`, `AdSet`, `Ad`, `AdCreative`, `AdImage`, `AdAccount`, `AdVideo`, `CustomAudience`, and `AdLabel`. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information. |

### Sensitive data handling

Facebook objects can contain personally identifiable information (PII) and payment details. Meta's Marketing API doesn't expose individual user-level data (all performance insights data is aggregated), but the following objects commonly contain sensitive fields:

| Object | Sensitive fields |
| --- | --- |
| `AdAccount` | `name` (may contain a business name), `owner` (a Facebook user ID), `funding_source_details` (partial payment method information) |
| `AdSet` | `targeting` (aggregated audience criteria, such as age, gender, interests, geography, and custom audiences; not individual user data) |
| `CustomAudience` | `name`, `description`, `data_source` (indicates whether the audience was built from a customer list or website traffic) |

`AdAccount.funding_source_details` requires the `business_management` permission. Refer to [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) for what happens if the connection's token doesn't have it.

If you operate under GDPR or a similar regulation, note that Meta doesn't expose `CustomAudience` membership data (the list of people in an audience) through the Marketing API. Meta retains that data exclusively, so Workato can't extract or forward it.

Use the **Hash** option in field-level data protection during pipeline configuration to protect PII before it reaches your destination. Refer to the [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) steps for more information.

Workato recommends hashing `AdAccount.funding_source_details` in particular.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use Facebook as a data pipeline source.

### Insights history is capped at 37 months

Meta retains Insights data for 37 months. Even if you set an earlier historical start date, `Basic Ad`, `Basic AdSet`, `Basic Campaign`, `Basic Account`, the demographic breakdown objects, and `Marketing Mix Modeling` can't sync data older than 37 months. `AdAccount`, `Campaign`, `AdSet`, `Ad`, `AdCreative`, `AdImage`, `AdVideo`, `AdActivity`, `CustomAudience`, and `AdLabel` don't have a historical start date at all. They only accumulate history from the date you create the connection forward.

### Reach-related metrics are unavailable for older date ranges

For date ranges that start more than 13 months in the past, Meta no longer returns `reach`, `frequency`, or `cpp` on `Basic Ad` and the demographic breakdown objects. Meta also quotas accounts to 10 asynchronous reach requests per day for date ranges past that threshold.

### Minimum sync frequency

The minimum supported sync interval is 15 minutes.
