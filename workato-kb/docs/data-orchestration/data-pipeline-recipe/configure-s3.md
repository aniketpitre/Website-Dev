# Configure Amazon S3 as your data pipeline source

Set up Amazon S3 as a data pipeline source to extract and sync records into your destination. This guide includes connection setup, pipeline configuration, and key behavior for working with `.csv` and `.parquet` files in S3 buckets.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when using Amazon S3 as a data pipeline source:

- Extract and sync data from `.csv` and `.parquet` files stored in S3
- Support for full and incremental sync via file detection
- Field-level selection for object extraction
- Field-level data masking

## Prerequisites

You must have the following configuration and access:

- An AWS account with an S3 bucket that stores `.csv` or `.parquet` files
- IAM role authentication configured for Workato
- Required S3 permissions for the pipeline to list and read files
- Folder paths and file patterns for the files to sync

## How to connect

Complete the following steps to connect to **Amazon S3** as a data pipeline source. This connection allows the pipeline to read and extract `.csv` and `.parquet` files from S3.

> **ACCESS KEY AUTHENTICATION DEPRECATED**
> 
> Workato recommends using IAM role authentication. Access key authentication remains functional for existing connections, but Workato doesn't recommend it for new environments.

Connect to Amazon S3

1. Select **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `Amazon S3` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name in the **Connection name** field.

4. Use the **Location** drop-down to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Select **Cloud** in the **Connection type** field, unless you need to connect through an on-prem group.
   
6. Select **IAM role** as the **Authorization type**.
   
7. Enter the ARN of the role configured in your AWS account in the **IAM role ARN** field. The IAM role must include permissions that grant Workato access to the buckets and folders required for pipeline extraction.
   
8. Optional. Enter a value in the **Restrict to bucket** field to limit the connection to a specific bucket. Use this setting when the IAM role has limited list permissions.
   
9. Enter the **Region** for the S3 bucket. For example, if your S3 console URL is `https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/`, enter `us-west-1`.
   
10. Optional. Enter a value in the **Download threads** field to increase file download concurrency. The default value is **1**, and the maximum is **20**.
    
11. Select **Connect** to verify and store the connection.
    

## Configure the pipeline

Complete the following steps to configure Amazon S3 as your data pipeline source:

1. Select **Create > Data pipeline** or press C+I.
   
2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from the source application.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **Amazon S3**.
   
7. Choose the Amazon S3 connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
   ![Choose an Amazon S3 connection](/assets/choose-s3-connection.Cv16_Ysn.png)_Choose an Amazon S3 connection_
   
8. Select the S3 bucket you plan to monitor in the **Bucket** field.
   
   ![Select S3 bucket](/assets/select-s3-bucket.CWH0Nyl1.png)_Select S3 bucket_
   
9. Click **Add object** to configure files you plan the pipeline to monitor and sync.
   
   Workato doesn't browse your S3 bucket. You must manually enter the folder path and file pattern. Ensure the path and filenames match your S3 structure.
   
10. Enter the folder within the bucket to monitor in the **Source Folder path** field. The pipeline monitors this folder and fetches files that match your filename pattern.
    
    ![Configure file settings](/assets/configure-file-settings-source.CVFjze4d.png)_Configure file settings_
    
11. Use the **File type** drop-down menu to select the file format to extract. Workato supports the following file types:
    
    - **CSV**: Extract data from `.csv` files. Requires additional file type settings configuration.
    - **Parquet**: Extract data from `.parquet` files. Schema and data types are inferred directly from the file.
12. Define which files to fetch using a pattern in the **Filename pattern** field. Use wildcards, such as `orders_*`, to include multiple files. The file extension is appended automatically based on the **File type** you select.
    
13. Click **Fetch matching files** to preview files matching the defined pattern.
    
14. Select a **Reference file** to define the schema for the destination table.
    
15. Configure file type-specific settings:
    
    **CSV**
    
    1. Use the **Header line** drop-down menu to indicate whether your CSV contains a header line. Select **Yes** if the CSV contents include a header line that shouldn't be parsed as data.
       
    2. Use the **Column delimiter** drop-down menu to select the character used to separate column values within each CSV line. Defaults to **Comma**.
       
    
    **Parquet**
    
    Parquet files include embedded schema information, so no additional file type settings are required. Workato reads the schema and data types directly from the reference file.
    
16. Click **Fetch schema** to load and preview columns from the reference file.
    
17. Review the schema to ensure it matches your expected table structure. The schema preview includes the columns from your source file along with the following system-generated columns:
    
    - `_file`: The name of the source file each row originated from.
    - `_line`: The line or row number of each record within the source file.
    
    ![Review schema](/assets/review-schema-s3.BXKIKDpo.png)_Review schema_
    
18. Configure how rows are merged in the destination table in the **Choose a merge strategy** field. Workato supports the following merge strategies:
    
    - **Upsert**: Inserts new rows and updates existing rows. The **Merge method** field appears when you choose **Upsert**. You can select one or more columns to use as the primary key for the destination table. The pipeline uses the system-generated `_file` and `_line` columns as a composite primary key if you leave **Merge method** blank.
    - **Append only**: Inserts all rows without attempting to match or update existing records. The pipeline doesn't match on a key and doesn't update existing rows when you choose **Append only**.
19. Click **Review object** to confirm your setup. This screen displays your file settings, file type-specific options, and merge details.
    
    ![Review object](/assets/review-object-s3.s4_ztQhU.png)_Review object_
    
20. Enter an **Object name**. This name defines the destination table name.
    
21. Click **Finish** to save the object configuration.
    
22. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. When you select an object, the pipeline automatically fetches its schema to ensure the destination matches the source.
    
    ![Expand object](/assets/expand-object-s3.B_lNI0jh.png)_Expand object_
    
    Expand any object to view its fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication.
    
23. Optional. Configure field-level data protection. After you expand an object, choose how to handle each field:
    
    - **Replicate as is** (default): Data values at the source are replicated identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the column before syncing to your destination.
    
    ![Configure field-level data protection](/assets/configure-field-data-s3.OQuIyiFP.png)_Configure field-level data protection_
    
24. Click **Add object** again to add more objects using the same flow. You can repeat this step to include multiple Amazon S3 objects in your pipeline.
    
25. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
26. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from Amazon S3 to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
