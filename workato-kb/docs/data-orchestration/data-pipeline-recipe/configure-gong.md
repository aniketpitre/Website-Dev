# Configure Gong as a data pipeline source

Set up Gong as a data pipeline source to extract call, scorecard, user, and workspace data from Gong and sync it to your destination. Use this guide to connect Gong, configure the pipeline, and understand the supported objects, sync modes, schema handling, sensitive data handling, and limitations.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use Gong as a pipeline source:

- **Cloud connectivity**: Connects to the Gong API v2 over https using a customer-specific, region-scoped base URL.
- **OAuth 2.0 authentication**: Authenticate using an Authorization Code Grant, reusing the same Gong OAuth infrastructure as the Workato Gong workflow connector.
- **Full sync and incremental sync**: Incremental capability is fixed per object. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
- **Object-level selection**: Choose the supported Gong objects to include in your pipeline.
- **Delete tracking**: Deleted records are flagged for reference objects. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information.
- **Schema drift detection and handling**: Detect and apply schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or keep the schema fixed with **Block new fields**.
- **Field-level data protection**: Hash sensitive fields, such as participant names, emails, and phone numbers, before they sync to your destination.
- **Configurable sync frequency**: Schedule syncs on a time-based interval or with a cron expression. The minimum supported interval is 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following requirements before you connect Gong as a data pipeline source.

- A Gong account with API access enabled
- An OAuth 2.0 integration created in the Gong Admin Center, providing a client ID and client secret. Refer to [Connect to Gong](#connect-to-gong) for setup steps.
- Your Gong API base URL. The base URL is specific to your Gong workspace's region, for example `https://us-XXXXX.api.gong.io` or `https://eu1.api.gong.io`.

> **REQUIRED PERMISSIONS**
> 
> Grant only the OAuth scopes for the objects you plan to sync. At minimum, your Gong integration must include the `api:users:read` scope, which Workato uses to verify the connection. Refer to [Recommended permissions](#recommended-permissions) for the full scope-to-object mapping.

### Recommended permissions

Grant the following OAuth scopes to sync the corresponding Gong objects:

| Gong OAuth scope | Objects |
| --- | --- |
| `api:users:read` | `users` |
| `api:calls:read:basic` | `calls`, `manual_calls` |
| `api:calls:read:extensive` | `extensive_calls`, `call_parties`, `call_topics`, `call_tracker_occurrences`, `call_interaction_stats`, `call_key_points`, `call_highlights`, `call_outline` |
| `api:calls:read:transcript` | `call_transcripts` |
| `api:calls:read:media-url` | `extensive_calls` |
| `api:settings:scorecards:read` | `scorecards` |
| `api:stats:scorecards` | `answered_scorecards` |
| `api:settings:trackers:read` | `trackers` |
| `api:stats:user-actions` | `user_activity_stats` |
| `api:workspaces:read` | `workspaces`, `library_folders`, `library_folder_content` |
| `api:library:read` | `library_folders`, `library_folder_content` |

`api:calls:read:media-url` grants access to the audio and video recording URLs within `extensive_calls`, in addition to `api:calls:read:extensive`. Gong also exposes `api:stats:interaction` and `api:stats:user-actions:detailed` scopes. Neither is required for this pipeline.

## Supported connection types

Gong data pipelines support one authentication method:

- **OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Grant)**: Sign in with a Gong user account to authorize Workato. Refer to [Connect to Gong](#connect-to-gong) for setup steps.

1. Select **Create > Data pipeline** or press C+I.
   
2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from Gong.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **Gong**.
   
7. Choose the Gong connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel.
   
   ![Add Gong objects](/assets/gong-add-objects.RsXBoI84.png)_Add Gong objects_
   
9. Search or browse the list of available Gong objects, select the objects you plan to sync, and click **Add**.
   
   ![Select Gong objects](/assets/gong-select-objects.DAb0ny2j.png)_Select Gong objects_
   
   > **SYNC MODES**
   > 
   > Objects that don't support incremental sync, such as `users`, `scorecards`, `workspaces`, `trackers`, `library_folders`, and `library_folder_content`, re-extract all records on every run. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
   
10. Optional. Click the settings icon next to an object to configure how the object syncs. Use the **Sync mode** drop-down menu to select a sync mode. The object defaults to full sync if Gong doesn't provide a timestamp for it. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
    
11. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. The pipeline automatically fetches an object's schema when you select it. This ensures the destination matches the source.
    
    Expand an object to view associated fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication.
    
12. Optional. Configure field-level data protection by expanding an object and choosing how to handle each field:
    
    - **Replicate as is**: Data values at the source replicate identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the field before syncing to your destination.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive fields. Refer to [Sensitive data handling](#sensitive-data-handling) for a list of fields that commonly contain PII.
    
13. Click **Add object** again to add more objects. Repeat this step to include additional Gong objects in your pipeline.
    
14. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
15. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from Gong to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    

## Supported objects

Gong data pipelines sync data from Gong API v2 REST resources. The following tables list the supported objects, grouped by category. Each object syncs as a separate table in your destination.

### Calls

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `calls` | Incremental | No |
| `call_parties` | Incremental | No |
| `extensive_calls` | Incremental | No |
| `call_transcripts` | Incremental | No |
| `manual_calls` | Incremental | No |

`call_parties` flattens each call's participants into one row per participant per call, so you can query attendee counts and talk-time patterns directly in your destination without parsing JSON. `call_transcripts` is enabled by default when you select it. Don't add the object, or deselect it, to opt out. Refer to [Call transcripts add storage volume](#call-transcripts-add-storage-volume) for more information. `manual_calls` contains calls where Gong's system field is `Uploaded Call`. These records are also included in `calls`.

### Call content analytics

The following objects are derived from `extensive_calls` and require Gong's AI-powered call analysis features to return data. You select and sync each one independently of `extensive_calls`:

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `call_topics` | Incremental | No |
| `call_tracker_occurrences` | Incremental | No |
| `call_interaction_stats` | Incremental | No |
| `call_key_points` | Incremental | No |
| `call_highlights` | Incremental | No |
| `call_outline` | Incremental | No |

Refer to [Gong subscription tier requirements](#gong-subscription-tier-requirements) for the specific features each object depends on.

### Scorecards

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scorecards` | Full sync | Yes (soft) |
| `answered_scorecards` | Incremental | No |

`scorecards` contains coaching scorecard templates. `answered_scorecards` contains completed scorecard reviews and requires Gong's Coaching feature.

### Users and activity

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `users` | Full sync | Yes (soft) |
| `user_activity_stats` | Incremental | No |

### Workspace and configuration

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `workspaces` | Full sync | Yes (soft) |
| `trackers` | Full sync | Yes (soft) |

`trackers` contains your Gong keyword tracker definitions and requires Gong's Smart Trackers feature.

### Library

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `library_folders` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) |
| `library_folder_content` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) |

`library_folder_content` requires `library_folders` to enumerate folder IDs on each sync.

## Sync modes

Gong data pipelines support full sync and incremental sync. Whether an object supports incremental sync is fixed per object.

### Full sync

Full sync extracts all available records for an object on every run. An object defaults to full sync when Gong doesn't expose a last-modified timestamp for it, because the pipeline has no way to identify which records changed since the previous sync.

### Incremental sync

An incremental sync extracts only records that changed since the last successful run.

- `calls`, `extensive_calls`, `manual_calls`, `call_parties`, `call_transcripts`, `call_topics`, `call_tracker_occurrences`, `call_interaction_stats`, `call_key_points`, `call_highlights`, and `call_outline`: Workato uses each call's `started` timestamp as the incremental cursor.
- `answered_scorecards`: Workato uses the scorecard's review date as the incremental cursor.
- `user_activity_stats`: Workato uses the requested activity date range as the incremental cursor.
- **Lookback window**: Gong can ingest call recordings from third-party calling systems hours or days after a call ends. Every incremental sync re-reads the trailing 24 hours of data in addition to the new window to capture these late-arriving recordings.

Refer to the [Supported objects](#supported-objects) tables to see the sync mode for each object.

### Delete tracking

Delete tracking is per-object and follows sync mode:

- `users`, `scorecards`, `workspaces`, and `trackers` are marked **Yes (soft)**: Gong's connector compares the current list of record IDs against the previous sync and flags any IDs that no longer appear with a `_workato_is_deleted` column set to `true`. Refer to [Synthetic columns](#synthetic-columns) for more information.
- `library_folders` and `library_folder_content` are marked **Yes (destination-inferred)**: your destination detects deletions by diffing full-sync snapshots, even though the connector doesn't add a `_workato_is_deleted` column for these two objects.
- All incremental objects, including `calls` and its related objects, are marked **No**. Refer to [Deleted calls remain in your destination](#deleted-calls-remain-in-your-destination) for why.

## Schema and data type handling

Gong data pipelines apply the following rules when they map source data to your destination schema.

### Nested and array data

Gong returns rich, nested data for call-based objects. Workato stores most of this nested data as JSON in a single column:

- `extensive_calls` sections that stay as JSON columns include `content.brief`, `content.structure`, `content.callOutcome`, `collaboration`, and the parts of `interaction` not covered by `call_interaction_stats` (such as `interaction.questions`).

Call participants, call transcripts, and the six call content analytics objects are the exceptions. Workato flattens each of these into its own table instead of keeping it as JSON, including `call_parties` (one row per participant per call), `call_transcripts` (one row per transcript sentence, including the call ID, speaker, topic, start and end time in milliseconds, and the sentence text), `call_topics`, `call_tracker_occurrences`, `call_interaction_stats` (one row per speaker), `call_key_points`, `call_highlights`, and `call_outline`.

Workato syncs JSON fields to the destination's native JSON type, such as `VARIANT` in Snowflake. Workato serializes JSON fields as strings if the destination doesn't support a native JSON type.

### Custom and variable fields

Gong exposes two fields whose structure isn't fixed:

- `calls.customData` and `extensive_calls.metaData.customData` are free-text strings that some customers populate through third-party calling systems. These sync as plain string columns.
- `extensive_calls` participants can include a `context` field with links to CRM records, such as Salesforce accounts or HubSpot deals. Workato stores it as a JSON column because this structure varies by which CRM you have connected to Gong.

### Timestamps

Gong timestamps sync as ISO 8601 timestamp-with-time-zone values. Workato preserves the offset Gong returns, which can be UTC or another time zone offset.

### Synthetic columns

Workato adds the following synthetic column to destination tables for objects with soft-delete tracking:

| Column | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_workato_is_deleted` | Boolean | Set to `true` for `users`, `scorecards`, `workspaces`, and `trackers` records that existed in a previous sync but no longer appear in Gong. All other fields on the row are `null`. |

## Sensitive data handling

Gong objects can contain personally identifiable information (PII) and verbatim conversation content. The following objects commonly contain sensitive data:

| Object | Sensitive fields |
| --- | --- |
| `calls`, `manual_calls` | Participant name, email address, and phone number |
| `call_parties` | Participant name, email address, phone number, and title |
| `extensive_calls` | Participant name, email address, phone number, title, and audio and video recording URLs |
| `call_transcripts` | Verbatim customer and prospect conversation text |
| `users` | Name, email address, phone number, and extension |
| `answered_scorecards` | Reviewer and reviewed user IDs, and qualitative coaching feedback text |

`call_transcripts` contains verbatim transcript text, the most sensitive data synced by this connector. Some jurisdictions require explicit consent to record and store calls. Workato can't enforce compliance with these requirements. Confirm your own obligations before you enable `call_transcripts` in your pipeline.

Use the **Hash** option in field-level data protection during pipeline configuration to protect PII before it reaches your destination. Refer to the [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) steps for more information.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use Gong as a data pipeline source:

### Private calls are excluded

Gong requires OAuth-integrated applications to exclude calls marked private. Workato applies this exclusion after fetching records from `calls`, `extensive_calls`, `call_transcripts`, and `manual_calls`, and to the call content analytics objects derived from `extensive_calls`. Calls marked private in Gong don't appear in your destination.

### Private and archived library folders are excluded

Gong's API doesn't expose private or archived Library folders to a read client. These folders, and any content inside them, don't appear in `library_folders` or `library_folder_content` in your destination.

### Call transcripts add storage volume

`call_transcripts` is enabled by default when you add it to your pipeline. Don't add the object, or deselect it, to opt out. Refer to [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) for more information.

> **STORAGE VOLUME**
> 
> A single 60-minute call transcript can total 20–200 KB of text. Enabling `call_transcripts` can add 2–20 GB of compressed storage at your destination for accounts with 100,000 or more historical calls.

### Deleted calls remain in your destination

Gong's API doesn't expose deleted calls to a read client. A call deleted in Gong after it was synced remains in your destination with its last-synced values. This applies to `calls`, `call_parties`, `extensive_calls`, `call_transcripts`, `manual_calls`, `answered_scorecards`, `user_activity_stats`, and the call content analytics objects.

### Gong subscription tier requirements

Some objects require a specific Gong subscription tier or feature to be enabled on your Gong plan:

- `trackers` and `call_tracker_occurrences` require Gong's Smart Trackers feature.
- `answered_scorecards` requires Gong's Coaching feature.
- `call_topics`, `call_key_points`, `call_highlights`, `call_outline`, and `call_interaction_stats` require Gong's AI-powered call analysis features.

The pipeline returns a permission error naming the missing feature or scope when it syncs an object whose required feature isn't enabled on your Gong plan.

### Recording URLs expire quickly

`extensive_calls` can include direct links to call audio and video recordings. These URLs expire 8 hours after Workato requests them from Gong, so you can't rely on a URL stored in your destination for later access to the recording.

### API rate limits

Gong enforces a rate limit of 3 API requests per second and 10,000 API requests per day. Pipelines that sync many objects, or run a large historical backfill, can take longer to complete as a result.

### Minimum sync frequency

The minimum supported sync interval is 15 minutes.
