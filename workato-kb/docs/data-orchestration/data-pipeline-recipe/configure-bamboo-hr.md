# Configure BambooHR as a data pipeline source

Set up BambooHR as a data pipeline source to extract employee records, job and compensation history, time off, time tracking, and custom table data into your destination. Use this guide to review the features supported, complete prerequisites, connect BambooHR to Workato, configure the pipeline, and understand sync behavior and known limitations.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use BambooHR as a pipeline source:

- **Cloud connectivity**: BambooHR is a cloud-only SaaS. Workato connects over `https://api.bamboohr.com/` using your company subdomain, and no on-prem agent is required.
- **API token and OAuth 2.0 authentication**: Connect with a BambooHR API key or by signing in to BambooHR. Refer to [Connection setup](#connection-setup) for setup steps.
- **Full sync and incremental sync**: Incremental sync is supported for the `employees` object, all employee table objects, and `time_off_requests`. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for details.
- **Delete tracking**: Detect deletions and mark deleted records in your destination. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for details.
- **Custom field and custom table discovery**: Discover and sync custom employee fields and custom employee tables defined in your BambooHR account.
- **Schema drift detection and handling**: Detect and apply schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or keep the schema fixed with **Block new fields**.
- **Field-level data protection**: Hash or replicate sensitive fields as is before the data reaches your destination.
- **Configurable sync frequency**: Schedule syncs on a time-based interval or with a cron expression. The minimum supported interval is 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Obtain the following before you connect BambooHR as a data pipeline source:

- A BambooHR account.
- Your BambooHR subdomain. For example, if you sign in at `https://acme.bamboohr.com`, your subdomain is `acme`.
- Credentials for your chosen authentication method:
  - **API token**: An API key generated in BambooHR. Refer to [Generate an API key in BambooHR](#api-token-setup) for setup steps.
  - **OAuth 2.0**: A BambooHR user account. You sign in to BambooHR and authorize access when you create the connection.

> **REQUIRED PERMISSIONS**
> 
> BambooHR applies the access level of the connecting user to all API responses. Generate the API key from an account with read access to all fields and tables you plan to sync, including compensation data. Refer to [Permission-restricted data is omitted](#permission-restricted-data) for more information.

## Connection setup

The BambooHR connector supports the following authentication types:

- [API token](#api-token)
- [OAuth 2.0](#oauth2)

## Configure the pipeline

Complete the following steps to configure BambooHR as your data pipeline source:

1. Select **Create > Data pipeline** or press C+I.
   
2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from BambooHR.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **BambooHR**.
   
7. Choose the BambooHR connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel.
   
   ![Add objects](/assets/add-objects-bamboo-hr.DCtmETDz.png)_Add objects_
   
9. Search or browse the list of available BambooHR objects, select the objects you plan to sync, and click **Add**.
   
   ![Add new objects](/assets/add-new-objects-bamboo-hr.Ba46fCZR.png)_Add new objects_
   
   > **SYNC MODES**
   > 
   > Objects that don't support incremental sync run a full sync on every run. Refer to [Supported objects](#supported-objects) for the sync modes each object supports.
   
10. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. The pipeline automatically fetches an object's schema when you select it. This ensures the destination matches the source.
    
    Expand an object to view associated fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication.
    
11. Optional. Configure field-level data protection by expanding an object and choosing how to handle each field:
    
    - **Replicate as is**: Data values at the source replicate identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the field before syncing to your destination.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive fields. Refer to [Sensitive data handling](#sensitive-data-handling) for a list of fields that commonly contain PII.
    
12. Click **Add object** again to add more objects. Repeat this step to include additional BambooHR objects in your pipeline.
    
13. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
    Workato recommends **Auto-sync new fields** because BambooHR accounts commonly add custom fields and custom tables.
    
14. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from BambooHR to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    

## Supported objects

BambooHR data pipelines sync data from the BambooHR REST API. The following tables list the supported objects, grouped by category. Each object syncs as a separate table in your destination. Some objects require specific BambooHR modules. Refer to [Module-gated objects](#module-gated-objects) for details.

| --- | --- | --- |
| `employees` | Full sync, incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `employees_directory` | Full sync | Yes |

### Employee tables

Employee table objects contain per-employee history records, such as job information and compensation. Each row belongs to a parent employee.

| Object | Sync modes | Delete tracking |

## Sync modes

BambooHR data pipelines support full sync and incremental sync. The sync mode is configured per object when you add it to your pipeline.

### Full sync

A full sync reads all available records from BambooHR for the selected object and overwrites the destination table. Deletions in BambooHR are reflected in the destination because each run replaces the table contents. Objects that don't support incremental sync run a full sync.

### Incremental sync

An incremental sync extracts only records that changed after the last successful run. BambooHR incremental sync uses the following mechanisms, depending on the object:

- `employees`: Workato uses the BambooHR Changed Employees data to identify employees that were created, updated, or deleted after the last sync, then extracts full records for the changed employees only. Deleted employees produce delete marker rows. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for details.
- Employee table objects, including custom employee tables: Workato uses the BambooHR changed table data to identify employees whose table rows changed after the last sync, then re-extracts all rows in that table for the changed employees.
- `time_off_requests`: Workato advances a date window based on the dates of each request's time-off period and re-reads a rolling recent window on each run to capture requests that were created or updated after their window synced.

Refer to the [Supported objects](#supported-objects) tables to see which objects support incremental sync.

### Delete tracking

Workato tracks deletions through two mechanisms, depending on the object's sync mode.

For the `employees` object, Workato uses source-driven soft-delete tracking. Workato detects employee deletions through the BambooHR Changed Employees data and writes a delete marker row with the `_workato_is_deleted` column set to `true` instead of removing the row from the destination.

For objects that support full sync only, deletions in the source are reflected in the destination because each run replaces the object's records entirely. Deletions are reflected on the next full sync rather than at the time they occur in BambooHR.

## Schema and data type handling

The following considerations apply to schema and data types when you sync data from BambooHR.

### Custom fields and custom tables

BambooHR supports customer-defined custom fields on the employee profile and entirely custom table sections. Workato discovers both automatically:

- **Custom employee fields** sync as additional columns on the `employees` object.
- **Custom employee tables** appear as separate selectable objects and sync with the same behavior as standard employee table objects.

Select **Auto-sync new fields** during pipeline configuration to sync custom fields added after the pipeline starts. Refer to [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) for more information.

### Data types

Currency and money fields sync as strings because BambooHR can return structured values for these fields. Nested values on time off and time tracking objects, such as time off request approval details, sync as JSON.

Workato syncs JSON fields to the destination's native JSON type, such as `VARIANT` in Snowflake. Workato serializes JSON fields as strings if the destination doesn't support a native JSON type.

### Synthetic columns

Workato adds the following synthetic columns to destination tables for specific objects:

| Column | Applies to | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_workato_is_deleted` | `employees` | Set to `true` for employees deleted in BambooHR. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information. |
| `_workato_id` | BambooHR dataset objects | A generated surrogate key that uniquely identifies each dataset row in the destination. |

### Custom report schema

BambooHR doesn't provide a schema endpoint for custom reports. Workato samples a record from each custom report and constructs the schema from that sample, so all custom report fields sync as strings in your destination.

### Sensitive data handling

BambooHR is an HR information system, and nearly every object contains employee PII. The following objects commonly contain sensitive fields:

| Object | Sensitive fields |
| --- | --- |
| `employees` | `ssn`, `dateOfBirth`, `gender`, `ethnicity`, `maritalStatus`, `address1`, `city`, `state`, `zipCode`, `workEmail`, `workPhone`, `mobilePhone`, `payRate`, `payType` |
| `employee_compensation` | `rate`, `type`, `reason` |
| `employee_bonus`, `employee_commission` | `amount` |
| `employee_benefits` | Benefit plan enrollment details |
| `employee_dependents` | `fullName`, `relationship`, `dateOfBirth` |
| `employee_emergency_contacts` | Names, phone numbers, and addresses of non-employees |
| `goals` | Performance evaluation data |
| `ats_applications` | Applicant names and contact information |

Use the **Hash** option in field-level data protection during pipeline configuration to protect PII before it reaches your destination. Refer to the [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) steps for more information.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use BambooHR as a data pipeline source.

### Permission-restricted data is omitted

BambooHR applies the connecting user's access level to API responses. Tables, rows, and fields that the connecting user can't access are omitted from schema discovery and sync results. Connect with an account that has read access to all data you plan to sync, including compensation fields if you plan to sync the `employee_compensation` object.

### Module-gated objects

The `timesheet_entries`, `goals`, `ats_applications`, and `ats_job_openings` objects require the corresponding BambooHR module, such as time tracking or applicant tracking. You can't sync these objects if your BambooHR account doesn't include the corresponding module.

### Timesheet entries history is limited to one year

The first sync for the `timesheet_entries` object extracts records from the last 365 days, even if you set an earlier historical sync start date.

### Time off requests sync by time-off dates

BambooHR returns time off requests based on the dates of the time-off period, not the request creation date.

### High-volume initial syncs

Initial syncs of employee table objects and the `employee_benefits`, `employee_training`, and `goals` objects can take a long time on accounts with many employees. Consider scheduling the initial sync during off-peak hours.

### Dataset and custom report syncs fail on source errors

Dataset and custom report objects can fail to sync if the BambooHR API returns a 5xx error for the requested fields. This is typically caused by corrupt data or a mapping bug on the BambooHR side. To resolve this, remove one or more columns from the object's schema and retry the sync, or contact Workato support.

### Minimum sync frequency

The minimum supported sync interval is 15 minutes.
