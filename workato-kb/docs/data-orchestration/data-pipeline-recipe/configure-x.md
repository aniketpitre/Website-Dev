# Configure X as a data pipeline source

Set up X as a data pipeline source to extract and sync ad account, campaign, and analytics data from the X Ads API to your destination.

Use this guide to review the features and prerequisites, connect X as a data pipeline source, configure the pipeline, and understand the supported objects, sync modes, schema handling, sensitive data handling, and known limitations.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use X as a pipeline source:

- **Cloud connectivity**: Connects to the X Ads API over HTTPS through `https://ads-api.x.com`.
- **Multi-account support**: Sync all ad accounts your connection can access, or select specific ad accounts by ID.
- **Object-level selection**: Choose from supported objects across the campaign hierarchy, creative assets, targeting, and analytics reports. Refer to [Supported objects](#supported-objects) for the full list.
- **Incremental sync**: Most campaign hierarchy, creative, and analytics objects sync incrementally. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
- **Delete tracking**: Detect and mark deleted records on supported objects with a soft-delete flag in your destination. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information.
- **Schema drift detection and handling**: Detect and apply schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or keep the schema fixed with **Block new fields**.
- **Field-level data protection**: Hash or replicate sensitive fields as is before the data reaches your destination.
- **Configurable sync frequency**: Schedule syncs on a time-based interval or with a cron expression. The minimum supported interval is 15 minutes.
- **Configurable analytics windows**: Set how many days of analytics history the pipeline backfills, and how many trailing days it re-pulls on every run. Refer to [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) for more information.

## Prerequisites

Connecting X as a data pipeline source requires:

- An X account with at least one ad account you plan to sync.
- An X Developer App approved for X Ads API access. Ads API access is gated separately from general X API access and reviewed by the X Ads API team, so approval can take time. Don't expect same-day activation. Refer to [Generate an X Ads API app](#generate-an-x-ads-api-app) for setup steps.
- Credentials for OAuth 1.0a authentication: a consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret generated from your approved developer app.

> **REQUIRED PERMISSIONS**
> 
> The authenticated X user must hold at least the **Campaign analyst** permission on the target ad account. **Account manager** and **Ad manager** include the required permissions.

## Generate an X Ads API app

Complete the following steps to create an X Developer App, [apply for Ads API access](https://docs.x.com/forms/ads-api-access), and generate the credentials your X connection needs:

### Generate a consumer key and secret

Complete the following steps to generate a consumer key and secret in X:

1. Sign in to the [X Developer Console](https://console.x.com).
   
2. Click **Apps > Create App**.
   
3. Enter an **Application Name**.
   
4. Select an **Environment**.
   
5. Click **Create New Client Application**.
   
6. Copy and save the **Consumer Key** and **Secret Key** for use in Workato.
   
   > **SAVE YOUR CREDENTIALS**
   > 
   > The credentials only display once. If you lose them, you must generate new ones.
   

### Generate an access token and secret

Complete the following steps to generate an access token and secret in X:

1. Sign in to the [X Developer Console](https://console.x.com).
   
2. Click **Apps**.
   
3. Click on the app you created in the preceding steps.
   
4. Under **OAuth 1.0 Keys**, click **Generate** for **Access Token**.
   
5. Copy and save the **Access Token** and **Access Token Secret** for use in Workato.
   
   > **SAVE YOUR CREDENTIALS**
   > 
   > The credentials only display once. If you lose them, you must generate new ones.
   

> **OAUTH 2.0 NOT SUPPORTED**
> 
> The X Ads API only accepts OAuth 1.0a. OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens, which the base X API accepts, are rejected on every X Ads API endpoint.

## Supported connection types

X data pipelines support OAuth 1.0a authentication:

- **OAuth 1.0a**: Authenticate with a consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret from an X Developer App approved for Ads API access. You can use either an app your organization registers and gets approved directly, or credentials from a shared app already approved for Ads API access, since the connection form accepts either. These tokens don't expire or refresh automatically, unlike an OAuth 2.0 connection. Tokens remain valid until you revoke them in the X Developer Console.

## Connect to X

Complete the following steps to connect to X:

Connect to X

1. Click **Create > Connection**.
   
2. Search for `X` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
   
   ![X connection setup](/assets/x-connection-setup.C74ieFMu.png)_X connection setup_
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Enter the **Consumer key** and **Consumer secret**.
   
6. Enter the **Access token** and **Access token secret**.
   
7. Click **Connect**.
   

## Configure the pipeline

Complete the following steps to configure X as your data pipeline source:

1. Select **Create > Data pipeline** or press C+I.
   
2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from X.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **X**.
   
7. Choose the X connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Use the **Sync all ad accounts** drop-down menu to choose whether the pipeline discovers and syncs data from every ad account reachable by the authorized X user.
   
   - **Yes**: Sync every accessible ad account automatically.
   - **No**: Sync only the ad account IDs you provide in a comma-separated list.
9. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel.
   
   ![Add X objects](/assets/add-objects-x.BLjG6mIL.png)_Add X objects_
   
10. Search or browse the list of available X objects, select the objects you plan to sync, and click **Add**.
    
11. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. The pipeline automatically fetches an object's schema when you select it. This ensures the destination matches the source.
    
    Expand an object to view associated fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication.
    
12. Optional. Configure the sync mode for an object:
    
    1. Click the **Settings** (gear) icon next to the object.
       
    2. Select a **Sync mode**:
       
       - **Incremental**: Sync only new and updated records.
       - **Full sync**: Reload all records on each run.
       
       Workato defaults to **Full sync** and disables this field if X doesn't expose a usable timestamp on the object.
       
    3. Click **Save**.
       
13. Optional. Configure field-level data protection by expanding an object and choosing how to handle each field:
    
    - **Replicate as is**: Data values at the source replicate identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the field before syncing to your destination.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive fields. Refer to [Sensitive data handling](#sensitive-data-handling) for a list of fields that commonly contain PII.
    
14. Click **Add object** again to add more objects. Repeat this step to include additional X objects in your pipeline.
    
15. Enter a value in the **Analytics reconciliation window** field to set the number of trailing days analytics data the pipeline re-pulls on every run, regardless of new activity. This field only applies if you selected an analytics object.
    
16. Enter a value in the **Analytics backfill window** field to set the number of days the pipeline fetches history per analytics job during the initial backfill. The backfill starts from the present and works back to when the entity was created. This field only applies if you selected an analytics object. X recommends `30` days per job to avoid job timeouts. The API allows up to `90` days (`45` for segmented objects).
    
17. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
18. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from X to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    

## Supported objects

X data pipelines sync data from the X Ads API (version 12). The following tables list the supported objects, grouped by category. Each object syncs as a separate table in your destination:

### Account and campaign hierarchy

The following objects mirror the X ad hierarchy: an `Accounts` record is the parent of `Funding Instruments` and `Campaigns`, which are the parent of `Line Items`, which are the parent of `Promoted Tweets` and `Promoted Accounts`. `Line Item Placements`, `Line Item Categories`, `Campaign Reason`, and `Funding Instrument Reason` are array fields on their parent record, normalized into their own tables for relational modeling.

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Accounts` | Incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Funding Instruments` | Incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Campaigns` | Incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Line Items` | Incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Promoted Tweets` | Incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Promoted Accounts` | Incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Line Item Placements` | Syncs with the parent `Line Items` object | N/A |
| `Line Item Categories` | Syncs with the parent `Line Items` object | N/A |
| `Campaign Reason` | Syncs with the parent `Campaigns` object | N/A |
| `Funding Instrument Reason` | Syncs with the parent `Funding Instruments` object | N/A |

### Creative assets

The following objects hold creative content and rich-media assets referenced by promoted tweets and line items:

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Cards` | Incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Media Library` | Full sync | Yes (soft) |
| `Account Media` | Incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Media Creatives` | Incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Promoted Tweet Content` | Full sync | No |

`Promoted Tweet Content` re-fetches tweet text and media referenced by your `Promoted Tweets` and `Scheduled Promoted Tweets` records on every run, so its row count depends on those objects.

### Targeting and audiences

The following objects define how line items target X users:

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Targeting Criteria` | Incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Custom Audiences` | Incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Web Event Tags` | Full sync | Yes (soft) |

`Custom Audiences` syncs audience metadata only, such as name, size, and type. X requires audience member lists, such as emails, phone numbers, and device IDs, to be hashed before they reach X. Workato doesn't extract this member data.

### Scheduled content

The following objects support scheduling tweets and video call-to-actions ahead of publication:

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Scheduled Tweets` | Full sync | No |
| `Scheduled Promoted Tweets` | Incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Preroll Call-to-Actions` | Incremental | Yes (soft) |

`Scheduled Tweets` doesn't return a delete flag. X exposes cancellation instead through a status column on each record.

### Account administration and reference data

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Account Apps` | Incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Promotable Users` | Incremental | Yes (soft) |
| `Referenced User Profiles` | Full sync | No |

`Referenced User Profiles` is an enrichment table of public X profile data for any user ID referenced by your `Promoted Accounts` records.

### Performance analytics

The following objects each return daily performance metrics for one entity level, such as account, funding instrument, campaign, line item, promoted tweet, or promoted account:

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Analytics - Account` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Funding Instrument` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Campaign` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Line Item` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Promoted Tweet` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Promoted Account` | Incremental | N/A |

### Segmented performance analytics

X data pipelines also break out the same daily performance metrics by an additional dimension, such as age, gender, platform, or conversion tag. Age, gender, and platform segmentation are available at every entity level listed in the previous sections. Conversion tag segmentation is available only for campaign, line item, promoted tweet, and promoted account, because those are the only levels that support the underlying web-conversion metric group.

Segmented values aren't expected to sum exactly to the equivalent non-segmented totals. This is expected behavior on the X platform, not a data quality issue.

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Analytics - Account by Age` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Account by Gender` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Account by Platform` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Funding Instrument by Age` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Funding Instrument by Gender` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Funding Instrument by Platform` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Campaign by Age` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Campaign by Gender` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Campaign by Platform` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Campaign by Conversion Tag` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Line Item by Age` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Line Item by Gender` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Line Item by Platform` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Line Item by Conversion Tag` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Promoted Tweet by Age` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Promoted Tweet by Gender` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Promoted Tweet by Platform` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Promoted Tweet by Conversion Tag` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Promoted Account by Age` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Promoted Account by Gender` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Promoted Account by Platform` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Analytics - Promoted Account by Conversion Tag` | Incremental | N/A |

### Reach and average frequency

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Reach & Average Frequency - Campaign` | Incremental | N/A |
| `Reach & Average Frequency - Funding Instrument` | Incremental | N/A |

These objects return unique-reach and average-frequency metrics rather than the standard performance metrics in [Performance analytics](#performance-analytics). Refer to [Limitations](#limitations) for the maximum date range per sync.

## Sync modes

X data pipelines support full sync and incremental sync. The sync mode is configured per object when you add it to your pipeline.

### Full sync

A full sync re-reads the complete record set for an object on every run and overwrites the destination table. `Media Library`, `Promoted Tweet Content`, `Scheduled Tweets`, and `Referenced User Profiles` use full sync, because X API doesn't expose a reliable modified-time signal for these objects.

### Incremental sync

An incremental sync extracts only the records that changed since the last run. Most campaign hierarchy, creative, targeting, and administration objects use the X `updated_at` field as a cursor.

Analytics and reach objects use a different mechanism, because X metrics recalculate over time and aren't a row-level resource. On each run, the pipeline extracts from the last successful sync date forward to the current time, and uses the **Analytics backfill window** to size the initial historical pull. `Reach & Average Frequency` objects re-pull their full configured date window instead. Refer to [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) for the analytics window settings.

Refer to the [Supported objects](#supported-objects) tables to see the sync mode for each object.

### Delete tracking

For objects marked "Yes (soft)," X returns a `deleted` flag directly on each record, and Workato reflects it in your destination.

`Promoted Tweet Content` and `Referenced User Profiles` don't support delete tracking, because they're re-fetched by reference from their parent objects instead of listed independently. `Scheduled Tweets` also doesn't return a delete flag. X expresses cancellation through a status column instead. Analytics and reach objects don't support delete tracking either, because a performance metric row recalculates on every query and isn't persisted with its own lifecycle. Metrics for deleted or paused parent entities remain fully queryable.

## Schema and data type handling

The following considerations apply to schema and data types when you sync data from X:

### Monetary amounts

Budget and billed-charge fields are expressed in micros of the account's local currency, for example, `1,000,000` micros = 1 unit of currency. Workato stores these values as integers and doesn't convert them at ingestion time.

### Timestamps and account timezone

Analytics objects align daily metrics to midnight in the ad account's own timezone, not UTC, then store the resulting instant as UTC. For example, a US Pacific-time account's `2026-01-05` row stores as `2026-01-05T08:00:00Z`.

### Nested and array fields

X doesn't have user-defined custom fields. Workato handles the following array and nested fields:

- `Line Items.placements` and `Line Items.categories` store as JSON columns on `Line Items`, and Workato also expands them into the `Line Item Placements` and `Line Item Categories` tables for relational modeling.
- `Campaigns.reasons_not_servable` stores as a JSON column on `Campaigns`, and Workato also expands it into the `Campaign Reason` table.
- `Funding Instruments.reasons_not_able_to_fund` stores as a JSON column on `Funding Instruments`, and Workato also expands it into the `Funding Instrument Reason` table.
- `Cards.components` stores as a JSON column with no equivalent child table.
- Conversion metrics on analytics objects, such as web conversion, mobile conversion, and lifetime value, store as JSON columns instead of flattening.

Workato syncs JSON fields to the destination's native JSON type, such as `VARIANT` in Snowflake. Workato serializes JSON fields as strings if the destination doesn't support a native JSON type.

### Video metric definitions

X redefined `video_total_views` to mean 100% in view for 3 or more seconds, or a manual play-button click. The prior definition remains available as a separate `video_3s100pct_views` column on the same analytics objects. Use the column that matches the definition you need. Don't assume `video_total_views` carries its original meaning.

### Synthetic columns

Workato adds the following synthetic column to destination tables for objects with delete tracking:

| Column | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_workato_is_deleted` | Boolean | Set to `true` for deleted records on objects marked "Yes (soft)" in [Supported objects](#supported-objects). |

## Sensitive data handling

X objects can contain personally identifiable information (PII). The following objects commonly contain sensitive fields:

| Object | Sensitive fields |
| --- | --- |
| `Promoted Accounts` | `user_id` (a public X account identifier) |
| `Promotable Users` | `user_id` (a public X account identifier) |
| `Referenced User Profiles` | `name`, `username`, `location`, `description` |
| `Custom Audiences` | `partner_source`, `audience_size` |

`Custom Audiences` doesn't expose individual audience members. X requires member lists to already be hashed by the uploader, and Workato doesn't extract that member-level data at all.

Use the **Hash** option in field-level data protection during pipeline configuration to protect PII before it reaches your destination. Refer to the [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) steps for more information.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use X as a data pipeline source:

### Analytics require completed advertiser verification

Analytics and reach objects return zero rows until your ad account completes the X advertiser verification in Ads Manager. Campaigns can be active and budget-valid and still not produce delivery metrics until verification finishes.

### Reach and average frequency window is capped at 7 days

`Reach & Average Frequency` objects reject any request window longer than `7` days. The pipeline re-pulls a rolling `7`\-day window on every run for these objects.

### Historical analytics backfill is limited per job

The X Ads API rejects an analytics job that spans more than `90` days of history and `45` days for segmented objects. Don't set the **Analytics backfill window** field higher than these limits, or the sync fails. Refer to [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) for more information.

### Metro-level segmentation is not supported

X data pipelines support age, gender, platform, and conversion-tag segmentation. Metro-level (Nielsen designated market area) segmentation isn't available.

### Minimum sync frequency

The minimum supported sync interval is 15 minutes.
