> Configure PostgreSQL as a data pipeline destination to replicate records from source applications into your PostgreSQL database using the source schema.

# Configure PostgreSQL as your data pipeline destination

Set up PostgreSQL as a destination for your data pipeline. This connection enables Workato to replicate data from source applications into your PostgreSQL database using the source schema.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when using PostgreSQL as a pipeline destination:

- Automatic creation of destination tables based on source schema
- Support for full and incremental data loads
- Field-level data replication without explicit field mapping
- Schema drift handling and update operations
- On-prem connectivity through an on-prem group. Cloud connections aren't supported yet for PostgreSQL as a data pipeline destination.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following requirements to connect PostgreSQL as a data pipeline destination:

- A PostgreSQL instance reachable from an on-prem agent host
- An active on-prem agent. Refer to the [on-prem agent documentation](/en/on-prem/agents/run) for setup steps.
- A user with privileges to create tables and write data
- An existing schema in the target database where destination tables are created

## Supported connection types

PostgreSQL pipelines currently support connections through an on-prem group only.

> **CLOUD CONNECTIONS NOT SUPPORTED**
> 
> Cloud connections aren't supported as a data pipeline destination for PostgreSQL yet. You must select an on-prem group in the **Connection type** field.

## Connect to PostgreSQL

Complete the following steps to connect to PostgreSQL:

Connect to PostgreSQL

1. Select **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `PostgreSQL` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.

4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Select an on-prem group in the **Connection type** field. Don't select **Cloud**. Cloud connections aren't supported for PostgreSQL as a data pipeline destination yet. Refer to [on-prem groups](/en/on-prem/groups) for more information.
   
6. Enter the hostname of your PostgreSQL instance in the **Database host** field.
   
7. Enter the port number in the **Database port** field. The default port is `5432`.
   
8. Enter your PostgreSQL username in the **User name** field.
   
9. Optional. Enter your PostgreSQL password in the **Password** field.
   
10. Enter the name of the database you plan to sync in the **Database name** field.
    
11. Optional. Expand **SSL settings** to configure an encrypted connection to your PostgreSQL instance.
    
12. Optional. Enter the schema that contains the tables you plan to sync in the **Schema** field. Workato uses the `public` schema if you leave this field blank.
    
13. Select **Connect** to verify and save the connection.
    

## Configure the destination action

Ensure the schema in PostgreSQL is newly created and empty before you start the pipeline. This prevents errors during the initial sync and allows the pipeline to create destination tables without conflicts.

1. Click the **Load data to target table in destination app** action. This action defines how the pipeline replicates data in the destination.
   
   ![Load data to target table in destination app](/assets/configure-destination-action.Bg2UqkRW.png)_Configure the Load data to target table in destination app action_
   
2. Select **PostgreSQL** from the list of available destination apps.
   
3. Choose the PostgreSQL connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.

   The **Load data to target table in destination app** action automatically replicates the object schema from the source to PostgreSQL. Explicit field mapping isn't required.
   
   Workato pipelines create destination tables based on the source schema. The pipeline also creates a stage and temporary tables to support data replication and update operations, so the connection requires permissions to create these resources.
   
4. Enter a schema in the **Schema** field. Workato creates destination tables in this schema. Only existing schemas are supported. This field overrides the schema set on the connection.
   
5. Select **Save** to save the pipeline.
