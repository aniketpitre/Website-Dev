> Set up SQL Server as a data pipeline destination in Workato to replicate data from source applications using the source schema.

# Configure SQL Server as your data pipeline destination

Set up SQL Server as a destination for your data pipeline. This connection enables Workato to replicate data from source applications into your SQL Server instance using the source schema.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when using SQL Server as a pipeline destination:

- Automatic creation of destination tables based on source schema
- Support for full and incremental data loads
- Field-level data replication without explicit field mapping
- Schema drift handling and update operations

## Prerequisites

You must have the following configuration and access:

- A SQL Server instance reachable from Workato (Cloud or On-prem group)
- A user with privileges to create tables and write data
- Host, port, database, and authentication credentials

> **SQL Server OPA requirement**
> 
> Workato requires SQL Server OPA version **29.1 or above** to support data pipelines.

## Connect to SQL Server

Complete the following steps to connect to SQL Server as a data pipeline destination. This connection allows the pipeline to write records into a target table in your SQL Server instance.

Connect to SQL Server

1. Select **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `SQL Server` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name in the **Connection name** field.

4. Use the **Location** drop-down to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Select **Cloud** in the **Connection type** field, unless you need to connect through an on-prem group.
   
6. Enter the URL of your hosted server in the **Host** field.
   
7. Enter the port number your server runs on in the **Port** field. The default port for SQL Server is `1433`.
   
8. Enter the username to connect to SQL Server in the **Username** field.
   
9. Enter the password to connect to SQL Server in the **Password** field.
   
10. Enter the name of the SQL Server database you plan to connect to in the **Database** field.
    
11. Optional. Specify whether you're connecting to an Azure SQL instance in the **Azure SQL** field. The default is **No**.
    
12. Optional. Expand the **Advanced settings** field to configure additional settings:
    
    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Use improved datetime handling | Enable enhanced handling of `datetime`, `datetime2`, and `datetimeoffset` datatypes in SQL Server. Defaults to true. Refer to the [Improved datetime handling](/en/connectors/mssql/introduction#improved-datetime-handling) section for more information. |
    | Database timezone | Set your database's local timezone. When timezones are provided for `datetime` and `datetime2` datatypes, values convert to this timezone before insertion. Default is UTC. |
    
13. Select **Connect** to verify and store the connection.
    

## Configure the destination action

Before you start the pipeline, ensure the schema in SQL Server is newly created and empty. This prevents errors during the initial sync and allows the pipeline to create destination tables without conflicts.

1. Click the **Load data to target table in destination app** action. This action defines how the pipeline replicates data in the destination.
   
   ![Load data to target table in destination app](/assets/configure-destination-action.Bg2UqkRW.png)_Configure the Load data to target table in destination app action_
   
2. Select **SQL Server** from the list of available destination apps.
   
3. Choose the SQL Server connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
   ![Choose a SQL Server connection](/assets/choose-sql-server-connection.ClWHmVWg.png)_Choose a SQL Server connection_
   
   The **Load data to target table in destination app** action automatically replicates the object schema from the source to SQL Server. Explicit field mapping isn't required.
   
   Workato pipelines automatically create destination tables based on the source schema. The pipeline also creates a stage and temporary tables to support data replication and update operations.
   
4. Select **Save** to save the pipeline.
   

## Identifier handling

SQL Server treats unquoted identifiers as case-insensitive and stores them in uppercase by default. Workato pipelines translate source column names into valid SQL Server identifiers by applying the following rules:

- Column names are uppercased
- Special characters such as `$`, spaces, or dashes are replaced with underscores (`_`)
- Identifiers are wrapped in square brackets to support special characters and reserved words

This ensures compatibility with SQL Server table creation and querying behavior.

### Example

The following source table structure:

| Source object | Source field |
| --- | --- |
| `Account` | `$Name$`, `Created Date`, `Limit` |

Results in the following table created in SQL Server:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [ACCOUNT] ([_NAME_], [CREATED_DATE], [LIMIT])
```

Unquoted queries can reference columns without case sensitivity:

```sql
SELECT created_date FROM account;
```

Bracketed queries must match the exact identifier format:

```sql
SELECT [_NAME_] FROM [ACCOUNT];
```
