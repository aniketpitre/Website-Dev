# Configure Zuora as a data pipeline source

Set up Zuora as a data pipeline source to extract billing, subscription, payment, and revenue data from Zuora and sync it to your destination.

Use this guide to connect Zuora as a data pipeline source, configure your pipeline, and understand the supported objects, sync modes, and limitations.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use Zuora as a pipeline source:

- **Cloud connectivity**: Workato connects to Zuora through the Zuora REST API over https. No on-prem agent is required.
- **Environment support**: Connect to Zuora production, API sandbox, and central sandbox environments.
- **Sync modes**: Full sync and incremental sync. Incremental sync uses each record's `UpdatedDate` timestamp to extract only new and updated records.
- **Object-level selection**: Choose which Zuora objects to sync, including custom objects.
- **Delete tracking**: Optional detection of hard-deleted records through a companion delete job. Delete tracking is disabled by default. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information.
- **Schema drift detection and handling**: Detect and apply schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or keep the schema fixed with **Block new fields**.
- **Configurable sync frequency**: Schedule syncs on a time-based interval or with a cron expression. The minimum supported interval is 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following requirements before you configure Zuora as a data pipeline source.

- A Zuora tenant with API access
- Credentials for your chosen authentication method:
  - **OAuth 2.0**: A client ID and client secret for an OAuth client created in Zuora. Refer to [Create an OAuth client in Zuora](#create-an-oauth-client-in-zuora) for setup steps.
  - **Basic authentication**: The username and password of an integration user provisioned for Workato. Use Basic authentication only for Zuora Production Copy environments.
- Zuora features enabled for any feature-gated objects you plan to sync, such as Invoice Settlement, Orders, or Prepaid with Drawdown. Refer to [Supported objects](#supported-objects) for the feature each object requires.

> **REQUIRED PERMISSIONS**
> 
> The OAuth client inherits the permissions of the Zuora user it is created for. Use a user with read access to the objects you plan to sync.

## Create an OAuth client in Zuora

Create an OAuth client for a user in your Zuora tenant to generate the client ID and client secret that Workato requires. Refer to [Create an OAuth client for a user](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users#Create_an_OAuth_Client_for_a_User) in the Zuora documentation for instructions. Skip this section if you plan to use **Basic** authentication.

> **SAVE YOUR CLIENT SECRET**
> 
> Zuora displays the client secret only when you create the OAuth client. Store it securely before you leave the page.

## Supported connection types

Zuora data pipelines support the following authentication methods:

- **OAuth 2.0**: Authenticates with a client ID and client secret generated in Zuora. Zuora recommends OAuth 2.0 for all server-to-server integrations. Refer to [Create an OAuth client in Zuora](#create-an-oauth-client-in-zuora) for setup steps.
- **Basic authentication**: Authenticates with the username and password of an integration user. Use Basic authentication only for Zuora Production Copy environments.

## Configure the pipeline

Complete the following steps to configure Zuora as your data pipeline source:

1. Select **Create > Data pipeline** or press C+I.
   
2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from Zuora.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **Zuora**.
   
7. Choose the Zuora connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel.
   
   ![Add objects](/assets/add-objects-zuora.CsKZ-1tu.png)_Add objects_
   
9. Search or browse the list of available Zuora objects, select the objects you plan to sync, and click **Add**.
   
   > **FEATURE-GATED OBJECTS**
   > 
   > Some objects are available only when the corresponding Zuora feature is enabled in your tenant, such as Invoice Settlement or Orders. Refer to [Supported objects](#supported-objects) for details.
   
10. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. The pipeline automatically fetches an object's schema when you select it. This ensures the destination matches the source.
    
    Expand an object to view associated fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication.
    
11. Optional. Configure field-level data protection by expanding an object and choosing how to handle each field:
    
    - **Replicate as is**: Data values at the source replicate identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the field before syncing to your destination.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive fields. Refer to [Sensitive data handling](#sensitive-data-handling) for a list of fields that commonly contain PII.
    
12. Click **Add object** again to add more objects. Repeat this step to include additional Zuora objects in your pipeline.
    
13. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
    Workato recommends **Auto-sync new fields** because Zuora tenants frequently add custom fields to standard objects.
    
14. Optional. Enter a value in the **Concurrency limit** field to cap the number of concurrent operations. Leave the field blank to use the default quota set by Workato. The maximum value is `100`.
    
15. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from Zuora to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    

## Supported objects

Zuora data pipelines sync data from Zuora REST API resources. The following tables list the supported objects, grouped by category. Each object syncs as a separate table in your destination.

All objects support full sync and incremental sync. Incremental sync uses the `UpdatedDate` field on each record. Delete tracking is opt-in per object and disabled by default. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information.

### Custom objects

Zuora data pipelines discover custom objects in your tenant automatically. Custom objects support full sync and incremental sync through the `UpdatedDate` field.

## Sync modes

Zuora data pipelines support full sync and incremental sync.

### Full sync

Full sync extracts all records for an object from Zuora. Use full sync for the initial historical sync or to rebuild an object's table in your destination.

### Incremental sync

Incremental sync extracts only records created or updated after the previous sync, based on each record's `UpdatedDate` timestamp. Records that share the same timestamp at a sync boundary may be re-delivered on the next sync. The destination deduplicates them by record `Id`, so no duplicates persist.

Business status changes, such as voiding an invoice, update the record's `UpdatedDate` and flow through incremental sync automatically.

### Delete tracking

Zuora handles record deletion in three ways, and each interacts differently with data pipelines:

- **Status transitions**: Most operational deletions in Zuora, such as voiding an invoice, change the record's status field. The record continues to exist and syncs through normal incremental sync. No special handling is required.
- **Hard deletes**: Records deleted through the Zuora DELETE API disappear from the standard extraction path immediately. When delete tracking is enabled for an object, the pipeline detects hard-deleted records through a companion query and marks them in the `_zuora_deleted` column. Zuora retains hard-deleted records for 30 days. Deletions older than 30 days can't be detected.
- **GDPR scrubs**: Records removed with GDPR scrub operations aren't queryable by any API and can't be detected.

Delete tracking is disabled by default. Enable it only if your organization hard-deletes records through the Zuora DELETE API, for example in data migration workflows.

## Schema and data type handling

The following sections provide information on schema and data type handling:

### Synthetic columns

Workato adds the following synthetic column to destination tables when delete tracking is enabled for an object:

| Column | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_zuora_deleted` | Boolean | `true` for records detected as hard-deleted in Zuora; `false` for active records |

The `_zuora_deleted` column is omitted from the schema when delete tracking is disabled for the object.

## Sensitive data handling

Zuora objects can contain PII and payment data. The following objects commonly contain sensitive fields:

| Object | Sensitive data |
| --- | --- |
| `Contact` | PII, such as names, email addresses, and postal addresses |
| `Payment Method` | Payment instrument data |
| `Payment Method Snapshot` | Payment instrument data |

Use the **Hash** option in field-level data protection during pipeline configuration to protect PII before it reaches your destination. Refer to the [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) steps for more information.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use Zuora as a data pipeline source:

### Hard-deleted records

Records hard-deleted through the Zuora DELETE API are detectable for 30 days only, and only when delete tracking is enabled for the object. Records created and deleted within the same sync window, and records removed with GDPR scrub operations, can't be detected. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information.

### Minimum sync frequency

The minimum supported sync interval is 15 minutes.
