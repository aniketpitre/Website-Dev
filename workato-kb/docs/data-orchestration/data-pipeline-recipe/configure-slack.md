# Configure Slack as a data pipeline source

Set up Slack as a data pipeline source to extract workspace data, such as channels, messages, threads, reactions, files, and users, into your destination.

Use this guide to review the features and prerequisites, connect Slack as a data pipeline source, configure the pipeline, and understand the supported objects, sync modes, schema handling, and limitations.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use Slack as a pipeline source:

- **Cloud connectivity**: Connect to Slack over HTTPS through `https://slack.com/api`. On-prem agents aren't required.
- **OAuth 2.0 authentication**: Connect using the same OAuth 2.0 connection type as the Slack workflow connector. Refer to [Supported connection types](#supported-connection-types) for more information.
- **Object-level selection**: Select the Slack objects you plan to sync as separate tables in your destination. Refer to [Supported objects](#supported-objects) for the full list.
- **Full sync and incremental sync**: Supports full sync and incremental sync modes. Incremental sync uses a per-channel cursor plus a configurable lookback window to catch recent edits. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
- **Direct message and archived channel inclusion**: Optionally include direct messages, group direct messages, and archived channels alongside regular channels.
- **Channel filtering**: Optionally limit the pipeline to a specific list of channels instead of your entire workspace.
- **Delete tracking**: Detect deletions for supported objects, either through a native soft-delete flag or by comparing successive full syncs. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for the list of objects.
- **Schema drift detection and handling**: Detect and apply schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or keep the schema fixed with **Block new fields**.
- **Field-level data protection**: Hash or replicate sensitive fields as is before the data reaches your destination.
- **Configurable sync frequency**: Schedule syncs on a time-based interval or with a cron expression. The minimum supported interval is 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Connecting Slack as a data pipeline source requires:

- A Slack workspace, and a Slack user account that's already a member of every channel you plan to sync, or that can join or be invited to those channels. Refer to [Limitations](#limitations) for more information.
- Permission to authorize a third-party application through Slack's OAuth flow.

> **REQUIRED PERMISSIONS**
> 
> Select only the OAuth scopes for the objects you plan to sync. Refer to [Recommended permissions](#recommended-permissions) for the scope each object needs.

## Recommended permissions

Workato needs two kinds of scopes to sync channel-based objects. Discovery scopes let Workato find which channels exist. Content scopes let Workato read what's inside a channel Workato already found. `channels`, `channel_members`, `messages`, `threads`, `reactions`, `message_attachments`, `message_files`, `pins`, and `bookmarks` are used in your channel list, and require a discovery scope for the channel types you plan to sync. Select the following discovery scopes for each channel type you plan to sync:

| Slack OAuth user scope | Channel type |
| --- | --- |
| `channels:read` | Public channels |
| `groups:read` | Private channels |
| `im:read` | Direct messages. Only relevant when you enable **Include direct messages and group direct messages**. |
| `mpim:read` | Group direct messages. Only relevant when you enable **Include direct messages and group direct messages**. |

Select the following additional scopes for the objects you plan to sync:

| Slack OAuth user scope | Workato objects |
| --- | --- |
| `channels:history` | `messages`, `threads`, `reactions`, `message_attachments`, `message_files` (public channels) |
| `groups:history` | `messages`, `threads`, `reactions`, `message_attachments`, `message_files` (private channels) |
| `im:history` | `messages`, `threads`, `reactions`, `message_attachments`, `message_files` (direct messages, when enabled) |
| `mpim:history` | `messages`, `threads`, `reactions`, `message_attachments`, `message_files` (group direct messages, when enabled) |
| `pins:read` | `pins` |
| `bookmarks:read` | `bookmarks` |
| `users:read` | `users` |
| `users:read.email` | `users` (email address) |
| `users.profile:read` | `users` (`custom_profile_fields` column) |
| `team:read` | `team` |
| `usergroups:read` | `user_groups` |
| `files:read` | `files` |

`channels` and `channel_members` need only the discovery scopes above. Slack's `channels:join` scope, which lets an app automatically join public channels, isn't available through this connection. Refer to [Limitations](#limitations) for more information.

> **CUSTOM OAUTH PROFILE REQUIRED FOR SOME SCOPES**
> 
> Granting `team:read`, `usergroups:read`, `files:read`, `pins:read`, `bookmarks:read`, or `users.profile:read` requires a Custom OAuth profile with your own Slack app. Refer to [Connect to Slack](#connect-to-slack) for setup steps.

## Supported connection types

Slack data pipelines support one authentication method:

- **OAuth 2.0**: Authorize Workato to access your Slack workspace using the same connection type as the Slack workflow connector. Refer to [Connect to Slack](#connect-to-slack) for setup steps.

## Connect to Slack

Complete the following steps to connect Slack as a data pipeline source:

Connect to Slack

Complete the following steps to connect to Slack in Workato:

1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `Slack` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
   
   ![Slack connection](/assets/slack-connection.BT6h8ZMj.png)_Slack connection_
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Optional. Expand **Advanced** and use the **Is this a Classic Slack app?** drop-down menu to select `Yes` or `No`. Select `Yes` only if you haven't migrated your Slack app to granular permission scopes. Refer to [Moving to granular permission scopes](/en/connectors/slack#moving-to-granular-permission-scopes) for more information.
   
6. Optional. Use the **OAuth user scopes** drop-down menu to select the OAuth user scopes to request for your connection. Leave this field empty to request the [default scopes](/en/connectors/slack#scopes).
   
7. Optional. Use the **Custom OAuth profile** drop-down menu to select a custom OAuth profile for your connection. Refer to [Custom OAuth profiles for Slack](/en/connectors/slack/custom-oauth) for more information.
   
8. Click **Connect**.
   
9. Click **Allow** to grant Workato permission to access your account.
   

> **CUSTOM OAUTH PROFILES**
> 
> A Custom OAuth profile lets you use your own Slack app for this connection instead of Workato's default shared app. Consider a Custom OAuth profile if you require full control over which scopes you grant.
> 
> A Custom OAuth profile can only connect to a single Slack workspace. Create a separate Custom OAuth profile, and a separate Slack app, for each workspace, if you use Slack Enterprise Grid with multiple workspaces. Refer to [Custom OAuth profiles for Slack](/en/connectors/slack/custom-oauth) for setup steps.

## Configure the pipeline

Complete the following steps to configure Slack as your data pipeline source:

1. Select **Create > Data pipeline** or press C+I.
   
2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from Slack.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app.B2OOUpgY.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **Slack**.
   
7. Choose the Slack connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel.
   
   ![Add objects](/assets/add-objects-slack.DvSTswO-.png)_Add objects_
   
9. Search or browse the list of available Slack objects, select the objects you plan to sync, and click **Add**.
   
10. Optional. Click the settings icon next to an object to configure how the object syncs. `messages`, `threads`, `reactions`, `message_attachments`, and `message_files` support both full sync and incremental sync, and default to incremental. Every other object only supports full sync. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
    
11. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. The pipeline automatically fetches an object's schema when you select it. This ensures the destination matches the source.
    
    Expand an object to view associated fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication.
    
12. Optional. Configure field-level data protection by expanding an object and choosing how to handle each field:
    
    - **Replicate as is**: Data values at the source replicate identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the field before syncing to your destination.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive fields. Refer to [Sensitive data handling](#sensitive-data-handling) for a list of fields that commonly contain PII.
    
13. Click **Add object** again to add more objects. Repeat this step to include additional Slack objects in your pipeline.
    
14. Enter a number of days in the **Lookback window** field. Workato rechecks messages, threads, reactions, message attachments, and message files created within this window on every incremental sync run, to capture edits made after the initial sync. Leave the default of `3` days, or set a value between `0` and `30`. Set this field to `0` to disable rechecking.
    
    An edit to a message outside this window isn't captured until you run a full sync of the affected object. Deletions aren't captured, regardless of this window. Refer to [Limitations](#limitations) for more information.
    
15. Use the **Include direct messages and group direct messages** drop-down menu to select whether to sync direct messages and group direct messages alongside channels. This requires the corresponding `im` and `mpim` discovery and history scopes on your connection. Refer to [Recommended permissions](#recommended-permissions) for more information.
    
16. Use the **Include archived channels** drop-down menu to select whether to include archived channels in the next full sync.
    
17. Optional. Use the **Channels to sync** field to select specific channels to sync. Leave this field blank to sync every channel your connection can access. Archived channels are included only when you also enable **Include archived channels**.
    
18. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
19. Optional. Enter a value in the **Concurrency limit** field to cap the number of concurrent operations. Leave this field blank to use the default limit set by Workato. Slack pipelines run object syncs one at a time regardless of the value you enter here, to avoid exceeding Slack's per-method rate limits.
    
20. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from Slack to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Optional. Select a start date in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. The pipeline fetches records starting from the specified date on the first run. Leave this field blank to fetch all records.
       
       This setting only affects `messages`, `threads`, `reactions`, `message_attachments`, and `message_files`, because every other Slack object syncs in full. You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Optional. Select a start date in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. The pipeline fetches records starting from the specified date on the first run. Leave this field blank to fetch all records.
       
       This setting only affects `messages`, `threads`, `reactions`, `message_attachments`, and `message_files`, because every other Slack object syncs in full. You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    

## Supported objects

Slack data pipelines sync data from the Slack Web API. The following tables list the supported objects, grouped by category. Each object syncs as a separate table in your destination. `team`, `user_groups`, `files`, `pins`, and `bookmarks` require a Custom OAuth profile. Refer to [Recommended permissions](#recommended-permissions) for more information.

### Channels and membership

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `channels` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) | N/A |
| `channel_members` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) | Syncs with the parent `channels` object |

### Messages and message content

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `messages` | Incremental | No | N/A |
| `threads` | Incremental | No | Syncs with the parent `messages` object |
| `reactions` | Incremental | No | Syncs with the parent `messages` object |
| `message_attachments` | Incremental | No | Syncs with the parent `messages` object |
| `message_files` | Incremental | No | Syncs with the parent `messages` object. Contains file metadata only, distinct from the top-level `files` object |

### Files, pins, and bookmarks

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `files` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) | N/A |
| `pins` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) | Syncs with the parent `channels` object |
| `bookmarks` | Full sync | Yes (destination-inferred) | Syncs with the parent `channels` object |

### Workspace and people

| Object | Sync mode | Delete tracking | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `users` | Full sync | Yes (soft) | N/A |
| `team` | Full sync | No | Single record for your workspace |
| `user_groups` | Full sync | Yes (soft) | N/A |

## Sync modes

Slack data pipelines support full sync and incremental sync. Each object supports one or both modes, depending on whether Slack exposes an incremental cursor for it.

### Full sync

A full sync reads all available records from Slack for the selected object and overwrites the destination table on every run. The following objects sync in full by default:

- `channels`
- `channel_members`
- `files`
- `pins`
- `bookmarks`
- `users`
- `team`
- `user_groups`

### Incremental sync

An incremental sync reads only new records since the previous run, using the message timestamp (`ts`) as the cursor. Each run also rechecks messages within the configured **Lookback window** to catch recent edits, because Slack doesn't expose a changed since filter. Refer to [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) to set this window, and to [Limitations](#limitations) for what falls outside it. The following objects sync incrementally by default:

- `messages`
- `threads`
- `reactions`
- `message_attachments`
- `message_files`

## Delete tracking

Delete tracking is per-object and follows sync mode. Full-sync objects reflect deletions because Workato diffs each run against the previous run. Incremental objects don't reflect deletions, because there isn't a second full snapshot to diff against:

- **`channels`**: Uses the native `is_archived` field when you enable **Include archived channels**. Otherwise, archived channels drop out of your destination (destination-inferred).
- **`users`**: Uses the native `deleted` field to preserve deactivated users with that field set to `true`, rather than removing users.
- **`user_groups`**: Uses a `_workato_is_deleted` column derived from Slack's `date_delete` field.
- **`channel_members`, `files`, `pins`, `bookmarks`**: No native signal from Slack. A record that no longer appears in Slack drops out of your destination on the next sync (destination-inferred), because these objects sync in full every run.
- **`messages`, `threads`, `reactions`, `message_attachments`, `message_files`**: None. These sync incrementally, and Slack doesn't signal a delete. A deleted message remains in your destination until you run a full sync of the affected object.

## Schema and data type handling

The following considerations apply to schema and data types when you sync data from Slack:

### Message timestamps

Slack message timestamps (`ts`) carry microsecond precision and also serve as each message's unique identifier within a channel, for example `1512085950.000216`. Workato stores `ts` as a string rather than a numeric value to preserve this precision.

### Message metadata and blocks

`messages` and `threads` include a `metadata.event_type` column and a `metadata.event_payload` column for app-defined structured data attached to a message. Workato stores `metadata.event_payload` as JSON, because its shape is defined by the app that attached it.

`messages` and `threads` also include a `blocks` column for Slack's Block Kit layout data. Workato stores `blocks` as JSON rather than a fixed set of columns, because Slack hasn't committed to a fixed schema for block content.

Workato syncs JSON fields to the destination's native JSON type, such as `VARIANT` in Snowflake. Workato serializes JSON fields as strings if the destination doesn't support a native JSON type.

### Custom profile fields

Workspace admins can configure custom profile fields on the `users` object, such as department, employee ID, or manager. Workato adds a `custom_profile_fields` column to `users` when your workspace has at least one custom profile field your connection can access. The column includes Slack's field values as JSON, keyed by Slack's internal field ID.

Populating this column requires one additional Slack API request per user, which can materially increase sync time for `users`, especially in workspaces with many users. Deselect `custom_profile_fields` in the object's field selection if the `users` sync is taking longer than expected. You can also deselect any other non-primary-key fields you don't need, for the same reason.

![Deselect fields](/assets/deselect-fields.CBYUb-6S.png)_Deselect fields_

## Sensitive data handling

Slack objects can contain significant PII. The following objects commonly contain sensitive fields:

| Object | Sensitive fields | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `users` | `name`, `real_name`, `profile.email`, `profile.phone`, `profile.skype`, `profile.first_name`, `profile.last_name`, `profile.display_name`, `tz`, `custom_profile_fields` | N/A |
| `messages`, `threads` | `text` | Highest PII risk. Free text where users can share names, email addresses, phone numbers, account numbers, and other sensitive business information |
| `files`, `message_files` | `name`, `title`, `user`, `url_private` | N/A |

Use the **Hash** option in field-level data protection during pipeline configuration to protect PII before it reaches your destination. Refer to the [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) steps for more information.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use Slack as a data pipeline source:

### Auto-join is not available

Slack's `channels:join` scope, which lets an app automatically join public channels, requires a bot token. This connection type doesn't support bot tokens, so this scope isn't available. Join a public channel, or have someone invite the connected Slack user to it, before or during setup.

### Sync only covers channels the connected user can access

Slack only returns content, such as messages, pins, and bookmarks, for channels the connected user is already a member of. Private channels have no bypass. Slack's admin APIs expose channel metadata only, not content. Full coverage is only provided in channels where the connected user is already a member, joins a channel as a member, or is invited to join individually.

### Deleted messages are not detected

Slack doesn't return deleted messages, and doesn't provide a signal when a message is removed. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information.

### Edits outside the lookback window are not captured

Each incremental run only rechecks messages created within the configured **Lookback window** (default `3` days, configurable from `0` to `30`). An edit to a message older than this window isn't captured until you run a full sync of the affected object.

### Binary file content is not synced

`files` and `message_files` sync file metadata, such as name, type, size, and URL, but not the file's binary content.

### Data retention settings limit historical availability

Messages that Slack has already deleted under your workspace's retention policy are permanently unavailable and can't be synced, regardless of your **Lookback window** or **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** settings.

### Each connection covers a single workspace

A Slack connection, with or without a Custom OAuth profile, is scoped to a single Slack workspace. Create a separate connection, and a separate Custom OAuth profile and Slack app, for each workspace you plan to sync, if you use Slack Enterprise Grid with multiple workspaces.

### Minimum sync frequency

The minimum supported sync interval is 15 minutes.
