# Configure Klaviyo as a data pipeline source

Set up Klaviyo as a data pipeline source to extract audience, campaign, flow, catalog, and engagement records into your destination.

Use this guide to generate a Klaviyo private API key, set up a connection, configure your pipeline, add objects, review sync behavior, and understand known limitations.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when you use Klaviyo as a pipeline source:

- **Cloud connectivity**: Connect to Klaviyo over HTTPS through `https://a.klaviyo.com`. On-prem agents aren't required.
- **Full sync and incremental sync**: Supports full sync and incremental sync modes, configured per object. Incremental sync uses a per-object timestamp cursor. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
- **Object-level selection**: Select from 33 Klaviyo objects, including `Profile`, `Event`, `Campaign`, `Flow`, catalog, tag, and reporting objects, to sync as separate tables in your destination. Refer to [Supported objects](#supported-objects) for the full list.
- **Schema drift detection and handling**: Detect and apply schema changes automatically with **Auto-sync new fields**, or keep the schema fixed with **Block new fields**.
- **Field-level data protection**: Hash or replicate sensitive fields as is before the data reaches your destination.
- **Configurable sync frequency**: Schedule syncs on a time-based interval or with a cron expression. The minimum supported interval is 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Connecting Klaviyo as a data pipeline source requires:

- A Klaviyo account
- Credentials for your chosen authentication method:
  - **API key**: A Klaviyo private API key with read permission for the resources you plan to sync. Refer to [Generate a Klaviyo private API key](#generate-a-klaviyo-private-api-key) for setup steps.
  - **OAuth 2.0**: A Klaviyo integration you manage that Workato can authenticate through.

> **REQUIRED PERMISSIONS**
> 
> Workato recommends using a **Read-only** private API key, or a **Custom** key scoped to read-only access for the resources you plan to sync, if you use API key authentication. Klaviyo private keys default to **Full** access, which includes write permissions Workato doesn't need for data pipeline source configuration.
> 
> Refer to [Recommended permissions](#recommended-permissions) for the full list of scope categories.

## Supported connection types

Klaviyo data pipelines support the following authentication methods:

- **API key**: Provide a private API key generated from your Klaviyo account. Refer to [Generate a Klaviyo private API key](#generate-a-klaviyo-private-api-key) for setup steps.
- **OAuth 2.0**: Connect through a Klaviyo integration you manage. Klaviyo supports Custom OAuth only for OAuth 2.0 authentication. You must configure a Klaviyo OAuth app and a [Custom OAuth profile](/en/custom-oauth-profiles) before you connect. Workato doesn't provide a managed Klaviyo OAuth app.

### Generate a Klaviyo private API key

Generate the key in Klaviyo before you create the connection in Workato, if you connect with API key authentication. Skip this section if you connect using OAuth 2.0 authentication.

Generate a Klaviyo private API key

1. Sign in to your Klaviyo account.
   
2. Go to **Settings > Account > API Keys** and click **Create Private API Key**.
   
3. Enter a name for the key.
   
4. Select **Read-only** to grant read access, or select **Custom** and grant **Read** permission for the categories listed in [Recommended permissions](#recommended-permissions).
   
5. Click **Create**, then copy the generated key immediately and store it in a secure location. You need this value to create the Workato connection.
   
   Klaviyo private API keys begin with `pk_`.
   

> **COPY THE KEY IMMEDIATELY**
> 
> Klaviyo doesn't let you view a private API key again after you create it.

Refer to Klaviyo's [Create a private API key](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/7423954176283) guide for more information.

#### Recommended permissions

Grant **Read** access for the following categories in the scope picker to sync the supported Klaviyo objects:

| Klaviyo scope category | Workato objects |
| --- | --- |
| Accounts | `Account` |
| Campaigns | `Campaign`, `Campaign Message`, `Campaign Tracking UTM Param`, `Campaign Values Report` |
| Catalogs | `Catalog Item`, `Catalog Variant`, `Catalog Category` |
| Coupons | `Coupon`, `Coupon Code` |
| Data Privacy | `Global Exclusion`, `List Exclusion` |
| Events | `Event` |
| Flows | `Flow`, `Flow Action`, `Flow Message`, `Flow Series Report` |
| Forms | `Form`, `Form Version` |
| Lists | `List`, `List Membership` |
| Metrics | `Metric` |
| Profiles | `Profile` |
| Reviews | `Review` |
| Segments | `Segment`, `Segment Membership` |
| Tags | `Tag`, `Tag Group`, `Campaign Tag`, `Flow Tag`, `List Tag`, `Segment Tag` |
| Templates | `Email Template` |

`Campaign Tag`, `Flow Tag`, `List Tag`, and `Segment Tag` also need read access to their parent object's category (Campaigns, Flows, Lists, or Segments) to look up the parent records.

`Global Exclusion` and `List Exclusion` also need the Profiles category, because Klaviyo retrieves them through the Profiles API.

Klaviyo doesn't have a dedicated reporting category: `Campaign Values Report` uses the Campaigns category, and `Flow Series Report` uses the Flows category.

## Connect to Klaviyo

Complete the following steps to connect Klaviyo as a data pipeline source:

Connect to Klaviyo

**API key**

1. Select **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `Klaviyo` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name in the **Connection name** field.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Select **API key** in the **Authentication type** field.
   
6. Paste the private key you generated into the **Private API key** field.
   
7. Select **Connect** to verify and save the connection. Workato displays a success message when the connection is established.
   

**OAuth 2.0**

> **CUSTOM OAUTH ONLY**
> 
> Klaviyo supports Custom OAuth only for OAuth 2.0 authentication. You must configure a Klaviyo OAuth app and a [Custom OAuth profile](/en/custom-oauth-profiles) to authorize this connection.

1. Select **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
   
2. Search for `Klaviyo` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a name in the **Connection name** field.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Select **OAuth 2.0** in the **Authentication type** field.
   
6. Optional. Expand **Advanced settings** and select scopes in the **Requested permissions (OAuth scopes)** field. Leave this field blank to request all read scopes.
   
   Selecting scopes in Workato doesn't grant them to your OAuth 2.0 connection alone. You must add the selected scopes to your Klaviyo OAuth app integration first.
   
7. Select a profile in the **Custom OAuth profile** field. Klaviyo requires a Custom OAuth profile to authorize this connection.
   
8. Select **Connect**. Workato redirects you to Klaviyo to authorize access.
   
9. Follow Klaviyo's prompts to sign in, select your account, and authorize Workato. Klaviyo redirects you back to Workato and displays a success message when the connection is established.
   

## Configure the pipeline

Complete the following steps to configure Klaviyo as your data pipeline source:

1. Select **Create > Data pipeline**.
   
2. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
3. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
4. Click **Start building**.
   
5. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from Klaviyo.
   
6. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **Klaviyo**.
   
7. Choose the Klaviyo connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
8. Click **Add object** to open the **Add new objects** panel.
   
   ![Add objects](/assets/add-objects-klaviyo.DF1SUYcr.png)_Add objects_
   
9. Search or browse the list of available Klaviyo objects, select the objects you plan to sync, and click **Add**.
   
   > **FULL SYNC ONLY OBJECTS**
   > 
   > Objects without a reliable timestamp field, such as `Campaign` and `Metric`, are labeled **Full sync** in the object list and sync in full. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
   
10. Optional. Click the gear icon next to an object to open its **Sync mode** settings. Use the **Sync mode** drop-down menu to select **Full sync** or **Incremental**, then click **Save**.
    
    The sync mode defaults to **Full sync** for objects without a usable cursor. Refer to [Sync modes](#sync-modes) for more information.
    
11. Review and customize the schema for each selected object. The pipeline automatically fetches an object's schema when you select it. This ensures the destination matches the source.
    
    Expand an object to view associated fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from data extraction and schema replication.
    
12. Optional. Configure field-level data protection by expanding an object and choosing how to handle each field:
    
    - **Replicate as is**: Data values at the source replicate identically to the destination.
    - **Hash**: Hash sensitive data values in the field before syncing to your destination.
    
    Workato recommends hashing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive fields. Refer to [Sensitive data handling](#sensitive-data-handling) for a list of fields that commonly contain PII.
    
13. Click **Add object** again to add more objects. Repeat the preceding steps for each additional object to configure its sync mode, schema, and field-level data protection.
    
14. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually.
15. Optional. Enter a value in the **Concurrency limit** field to cap the number of concurrent operations. Klaviyo extraction is effectively serialized to protect your shared API quota, so a higher concurrency value doesn't speed up this source.
    
16. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from Klaviyo to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The pipeline syncs every 6 hours, for example, if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter **6** in the **Trigger every** field. The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank, except for `Event` and the reporting objects, which default to the preceding `365` days.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you configure your data pipeline destination.
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Select **Custom schedule** in the **Time unit** field.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes. For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank, except for `Event` and the reporting objects, which default to the preceding `365` days.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you configure your data pipeline destination.
       
    

## Supported objects

Klaviyo data pipelines sync data from Klaviyo's REST API. The following tables list the supported objects, grouped by category. Each object syncs as a separate table in your destination. Klaviyo custom objects and custom object records aren't currently supported.

### Audience objects

| Object | Sync mode(s) | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Profile` | Full sync, incremental | No |
| `List` | Full sync, incremental | No |
| `List Membership` | Full sync, incremental | No |
| `Segment` | Full sync, incremental | No |
| `Segment Membership` | Full sync, incremental | No |
| `Global Exclusion` | Full sync, incremental | N/A |
| `List Exclusion` | Full sync, incremental | N/A |

`List Membership` and `Segment Membership` sync each profile's membership in a `List` or `Segment`. `Global Exclusion` and `List Exclusion` sync a profile's suppression from email marketing account-wide or for a specific list.

### Campaigns and flows

| Object | Sync mode(s) | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Campaign` | Full sync | No |
| `Campaign Message` | Syncs with the parent `Campaign` object | No |
| `Campaign Tracking UTM Param` | Syncs with the parent `Campaign` object | No |
| `Flow` | Full sync, incremental | No |
| `Flow Action` | Full sync, incremental | No |
| `Flow Message` | Full sync, incremental | No |
| `Email Template` | Full sync, incremental | No |

### Catalog objects

| Object | Sync mode(s) | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Catalog Item` | Full sync, incremental | No |
| `Catalog Variant` | Syncs with the parent `Catalog Item` object | No |
| `Catalog Category` | Full sync | No |

### Coupon objects

| Object | Sync mode(s) | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Coupon` | Full sync | No |
| `Coupon Code` | Syncs with the parent `Coupon` object | No |

### Tag objects

| Object | Sync mode(s) | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Tag` | Full sync | No |
| `Tag Group` | Full sync | No |
| `Campaign Tag` | Syncs with the parent `Campaign` object | No |
| `Flow Tag` | Syncs with the parent `Flow` object | No |
| `List Tag` | Syncs with the parent `List` object | No |
| `Segment Tag` | Syncs with the parent `Segment` object | No |

### Forms and reviews

| Object | Sync mode(s) | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Form` | Full sync | No |
| `Form Version` | Full sync, incremental | No |
| `Review` | Full sync, incremental | No |

### Reporting objects

`Campaign Values Report` and `Flow Series Report` are opt-in. Configure one or more Klaviyo metric IDs on your connection to enable these objects. Workato syncs empty tables for both objects, without calling Klaviyo's Reporting API, if you don't configure any metric IDs.

| Object | Sync mode(s) | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Campaign Values Report` | Full sync | N/A |
| `Flow Series Report` | Full sync | N/A |

Refer to [Limitations](#limitations) for the account-wide request cap that applies to these objects.

### Account and engagement objects

| Object | Sync mode(s) | Delete tracking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Account` | Full sync | No |
| `Event` | Append-only | N/A |
| `Metric` | Full sync | No |

`Account` syncs a single record for your Klaviyo account.

## Sync modes

Klaviyo data pipelines support full sync and incremental sync. The sync mode is configured per object when you add it to your pipeline.

### Full sync

A full sync reads all available records for the selected object from Klaviyo and replaces the record set in your destination table.

### Incremental sync

An incremental sync extracts only new or changed records since the last successful run, using a per-object timestamp cursor, such as `updated` on `Profile` or `joined_group_at` on `List Membership`. Objects without a reliable timestamp field, such as `Campaign`, `Metric`, and the other objects marked **Full sync** in the [Supported objects](#supported-objects) tables, sync only in full sync mode. `Event` is append-only. Workato applies a 30 minute overlap on each incremental run to capture late-arriving events, so events in that overlap window can be re-emitted. Your destination's upsert behavior deduplicates re-emitted events by event ID.

### Delete tracking

Workato doesn't currently detect deleted records for any Klaviyo object. A record deleted in Klaviyo still appears in your destination until you remove it manually or reload the object with a full sync.

`Global Exclusion` and `List Exclusion` are an exception to this general behavior. Each record represents a profile's current suppression from email marketing, so the record itself is the signal, rather than a separate delete event.

## Schema and data type handling

The following considerations apply to schema and data types when you sync data from Klaviyo:

### Nested and list-type fields

Klaviyo objects with nested attributes or arrays, such as `Profile.properties`, `Event.event_properties`, `Campaign.tracking_options`, `Catalog Item.custom_metadata`, and the `statistics` and `date_times` fields on the reporting objects, are stored as a single JSON column in your destination. Workato doesn't flatten these into individual columns.

Workato syncs JSON fields to the destination's native JSON type, such as `VARIANT` in Snowflake. Workato serializes JSON fields as strings if the destination doesn't support a native JSON type.

Tenant-specific custom attributes on `Profile` and `Event` stay inside the packed `properties` and `event_properties` JSON columns. They don't surface as newly discovered top-level columns, even with **Auto-sync new fields** enabled.

### Timestamps

Klaviyo returns timestamps in ISO 8601 format (UTC). Workato preserves these values as-is in the destination.

## Sensitive data handling

Klaviyo objects can contain personally identifiable information (PII). The following objects commonly contain sensitive fields:

| Object | Sensitive fields |
| --- | --- |
| `Profile` | `email`, `phone_number`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `location`, `organization` |
| `Global Exclusion` | `email`, `phone_number`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `location`, `organization` |
| `List Exclusion` | `email`, `phone_number`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `location`, `organization` |
| `Review` | `email`, `author` |
| `Account` | `contact_information` |

Use the **Hash** option in field-level data protection during pipeline configuration to protect PII before it reaches your destination. Refer to the [Configure the pipeline](#configure-the-pipeline) steps for more information.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you use Klaviyo as a data pipeline source:

### Delete tracking isn't currently supported

Workato doesn't detect deleted records for any Klaviyo object. Reconcile or remove the corresponding row in your destination manually after you delete a record in Klaviyo. Refer to [Delete tracking](#delete-tracking) for more information.

Some destination tables include a `_workato_is_deleted` column for schema compatibility with other Workato connectors. This column is `false` in the current release. Deletion inference isn't available yet.

### Archived flows aren't synced

The `Flow` object excludes archived flows, matching Klaviyo's own default behavior. Reactivate a flow in Klaviyo if you need it to appear in your pipeline.

### Predictive analytics fields aren't included on Profile

`Profile` doesn't include Klaviyo's predictive analytics fields, such as predicted lifetime value or churn probability.

### Custom objects aren't supported

The Klaviyo data pipeline source doesn't currently support Klaviyo custom objects or custom object records. This limitation doesn't apply to custom attributes stored in the `Profile.properties` and `Event.event_properties` JSON columns.

### Reporting objects share Klaviyo's account-wide reporting cap

Klaviyo enforces an account-wide cap of approximately `225` reporting requests per day. This cap is shared with any other tool that calls Klaviyo's Reporting API from the same account, including other integrations. `Campaign Values Report` and `Flow Series Report` consume this cap. Refer to [Reporting objects](#reporting-objects) for setup requirements.

### Minimum sync frequency

The minimum supported sync interval is 15 minutes.
