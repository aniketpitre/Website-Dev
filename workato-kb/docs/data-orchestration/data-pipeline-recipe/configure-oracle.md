> Configure Oracle as a data pipeline source to extract database table records and sync them to your destination with full or incremental sync.

# Configure Oracle as your data pipeline source

Set up Oracle as a data pipeline source to extract and sync records into your destination using the SuiteAnalytics Connect service. This guide includes connection setup, pipeline configuration, and key behavior for working with NetSuite2 as a source.

## Features supported

The following features are supported when using Oracle as a data pipeline source:

- Extract data from Oracle database tables
- Support for full and incremental sync
- Field-level selection for table extraction
- Schema drift detection and handling
- Field-level data masking

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following configuration before creating the Oracle connection:

- Access to an Oracle database instance
  
- A database user with **read access** to the tables used in the pipeline
  
- The following connection details:
  
  - Database host
  - Database port (typically `1521`)
  - Database name (SID or service name)
  - Database username and password
- Ensure an **on-prem agent** is configured and active if the Oracle database runs inside a private network.
  

## How to connect

Complete the following steps to create an Oracle connection:

- [Step 1: Set up an Oracle database user](#step-1-set-up-an-oracle-database-user).
- [Step 2: Connect Oracle to Workato](#step-2-connect-oracle-to-workato).

## Step 1: Set up an Oracle database user

At a minimum, the database user account must have the `SELECT` permission for the database specified in the [connection settings](#step-2-connect-oracle-to-workato). Refer to the following example to set up permissions.

> **Click here to find out how to set up permissions**
> 
> If we are trying to connect to a named schema (`HR_PROD`) in an Oracle instance, using a new database user `WORKATO`, the following example queries can be used.
> 
> First, create a new user dedicated to integration use cases with Workato.
> 
> ```
> CREATE USER WORKATO IDENTIFIED BY password
> ```
> 
> Next, grant `CONNECT` to this user.
> 
> ```
> GRANT CONNECT TO WORKATO;
> ```
> 
> This allows the user to have login access to the Oracle instance. However, this user does not have access to any tables.
> 
> The next step is to grant access to `SUPPLIER` table in the `HR_PROD` schema. In this example, we only wish to grant `SELECT` and `INSERT` permissions.
> 
> ```
> GRANT SELECT,INSERT ON HR_PROD.SUPPLIER TO WORKATO;
> ```
> 
> Finally, check that this user has the necessary permissions. Run a query to see all grants.
> 
> ```
> SELECT * FROM DBA_ROLE_PRIVS WHERE GRANTEE = 'WORKATO';
> SELECT * FROM DBA_TAB_PRIVS WHERE GRANTEE = 'WORKATO';
> ```
> 
> This should return the following minimum permission to create a Oracle connection on Workato.
> 
> ```
> +---------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
> | GRANTEE | GRANTED_ROLE | ADMIN_OPTION | DEFAULT_ROLE |
> +---------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
> | WORKATO | CONNECT      | NO           | YES          |
> +---------+--------------+--------------+--------------+>
> 
> +---------+---------+------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
> | GRANTEE | OWNER   | TABLE_NAME | GRANTOR | PRIVILEGE | GRANTABLE | HIERARCHY |
> +---------+---------+------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
> | WORKATO | HR_PROD | SUPPLIER   | ROOT    | SELECT    | NO        | NO        |
> | WORKATO | HR_PROD | SUPPLIER   | ROOT    | INSERT    | NO        | NO        |
> +---------+---------+------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
> 3 rows in set (0.61 sec)
> ```

## Step 2: Connect Oracle to Workato

Complete the following steps to connect Oracle to Workato:

Workato supports the following Oracle connection types:

- [Cloud connection](#oracle-cloud-connection): Use this option when your Oracle database is accessible over the public internet.
- [On-prem agent connection](#oracle-opa-connection): Use this option when your Oracle database runs in a private network and requires an On-prem agent (OPA) to establish connectivity.

### Cloud connection

Complete the following steps to connect to Oracle using a Cloud connection:

1. Click **Create > Connection**.
   
2. Search for and select **Oracle** on the **New connection** page.
   
3. Enter a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Select **Cloud** in the **Connection type** field.
   
6. Enter the database host address in the **Database host** field.
   
7. Enter the number of the **Database port** the server is running on, typically `1521`.
   
8. Enter the database user's **User name** from [Step 1](#step-1-set-up-an-oracle-database-user).
   
9. Enter the database user's **Password**.
   
10. Optional. Enter the database schema in the **Schema** field.
    
11. Optional. Expand [Advanced settings](#configure-advanced-settings) to configure additional connection options.
    
12. Click **Connect**.
    

### On-prem agent connection

Use an on-prem agent connection when your Oracle database is located in a private network that can't be accessed directly from the internet.

Complete the following steps to connect to Oracle using an on-prem agent (OPA):

1. Click **Create > Connection**.
   
2. Search for and select **Oracle** on the **New connection** page.
   
3. Enter a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
   
5. Select your **on-prem group** in the **Connection type** field.
   
6. Select a **Database type**. Available options include **Service name**, **SID**, and **TNS**.
   
   SID and TNS database types require On-prem agent version 27.1 or later.
   
   Refer to the [Database types](#database-type-reference) section for more information.
   
7. Provide the following fields based on the **Database type** selected:
   
   **Service name**
   
   Enter the Oracle service name for the database in the **Service name** field.
   
   **SID**
   
   Enter the Oracle system identifier (SID) for the database instance in the **SID** field.
   
   **TNS**
   
   Enter the full Oracle Net connection descriptor from your `tnsnames.ora` configuration in the **TNS Definition** field.
   
8. Complete the following fields if you selected **Service name** or **SID** as the **Database type**:
   
   1. Enter the database host address in the **Database host** field.
      
   2. Enter the number of the **Database port** the server is running on, typically `1521`.
      
9. Enter the database user's **User name** from [Step 1](#step-1-set-up-an-oracle-database-user).
   
10. Enter the database user's **Password**.
    
11. Optional. Enter the database schema in the **Schema** field.
    
12. Optional. Expand [Advanced settings](#configure-advanced-settings) to configure additional connection options.
    
13. Optional. Expand **Pooling settings** to configure Oracle database connection pooling.
    
14. Optional. Expand **Additional properties for Oracle connection** to add custom Oracle connection parameters.
    
15. Click **Connect**.
    

## Database types

Workato displays the **Database type** field only when you select an **On-prem group** in the **Connection type** field while creating an Oracle connection.

Refer to [Step 2: Connect Oracle to Workato](#step-2-connect-oracle-to-workato) for instructions on configuring the connection.

Select one of the following **Database type** options when connecting through an On-prem agent (OPA).

### Service name

Use **Service name** to connect to a database service within an Oracle instance. For example, `ORCLPDB1`.

> **ORACLE 12C+ PDB ENVIRONMENTS**
> 
> We recommend using **Service name** instead of **SID** in Oracle 12c and later environments that use multitenant architecture (CDB/PDB).
> 
> In these environments:
> 
> - **SID** connections may connect to the **CDB root container**
> - **Service name** connections may connect to a specific **pluggable database (PDB)**
> 
> If a database user exists in a PDB, authentication can fail when connecting through the CDB root even if the username and password are correct.
> 
> Use **Service name** to ensure the connection targets the correct PDB.

Service names have the following characteristics:

- Map to database services registered with the Oracle listener
- Support Real Application Clusters and load balancing
- Identify logical database services rather than specific instances

Use this option for most modern Oracle deployments.

### SID

Use **SID** (System Identifier) to connect to a specific Oracle database instance. For example, `ORCL`.

SIDs have the following characteristics:

- Identify a single Oracle database instance
- Do not support load balancing
- Commonly appear in older Oracle deployments

Use this option when your DBA provides an SID instead of a service name.

### TNS

Use **TNS** when you have a full Oracle Net connect descriptor.

TNS definitions have the following characteristics:

- Reference connection entries defined in the `tnsnames.ora` file
- Abstract the underlying connection details
- May internally use a **SID** or **Service name**
- Support advanced configurations such as load balancing and high availability

Enter the full TNS descriptor in the **TNS definition** field. For example:

```text
(DESCRIPTION=
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=db.example.com)(PORT=1521))
(CONNECT_DATA=
(SERVICE_NAME=ORCLPDB1)
)
)
```

## Configure the pipeline

Complete the following steps to configure Oracle as your data pipeline source:

1. Return to your Workato account.
   
2. Select **Create > Data pipeline** or press C+I.
   
3. Enter a name for the data pipeline in the **Data pipeline name** field.
   
   ![Data pipeline setup](/assets/set-up-pipeline.Cxx6hIk2.png)_Data pipeline setup_
   
4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the data pipeline.
   
5. Click **Start building**.
   
6. Click the **Extract new/updated records from source app** trigger. This trigger defines how the pipeline retrieves data from the source application.
   
   ![Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger](/assets/choose-source-app-oracle.BUuhzejr.png)_Configure the Extract new/updated records from source app trigger_
   
7. Use the **Your Connected Source Apps** drop-down menu to select **Oracle**.
   
8. Choose the Oracle connection you plan to use for this pipeline. Alternatively, click **\+ New connection** to create a new connection.
   
   ![Choose a Oracle connection](/assets/choose-oracle-connection.CSsBUmrg.png)_Choose a Oracle connection_
   
9. Click **Add object** to open the object modal.
   
   ![Add object](/assets/add-oracle-object.Bd_CYmQQ.png)_Add object_
   
10. Search or browse the list of available Oracle tables and select the tables you plan to sync.
    
11. Click **Add**.
    
12. Review and customize the schema for each selected table. The pipeline automatically fetches the schema for each table you select to ensure the destination matches the source.
    
    ![Expand object](/assets/expand-object-oracle.Br2pJtZq.png)_Expand object_
    
    You can expand a table to view its fields. Keep all fields selected to extract all available data, or deselect specific fields to exclude them from extraction and schema replication.
    
13. Configure sync settings for each table:
    
    1. Click the **Settings** (gear) icon next to the table.
       
       ![Configure sync settings](/assets/click-settings-icon.Bi0q8G5n.png)_Configure sync settings_
       
    2. Select a **Sync mode**:
       
       **Incremental**
       
       1. Select **Incremental** to sync only new and updated records.
          
       2. Select a **Change tracking column** for incremental syncs. This column detects new and updated records.
          
          ![Configure sync settings](/assets/configure-sync-settings.BYz_qWjn.png)_Configure sync settings_
          
          The selected tracking column is required for incremental syncs and can't be deselected.
          
          The following occurs if the table doesn't contain a valid timestamp or change tracking column:
          
          - Incremental sync isn't available
          - The pipeline defaults to **Full sync**
          - The **Change tracking column** field is disabled
          - The pipeline reloads all records on each run
       3. Click **Save**.
          
       
       **Full sync**
       
       1. Select **Full Sync** to reload all records on each run. The **Change tracking column** field doesn't appear for full sync.
          
          ![Configure sync settings](/assets/configure-sync-settings-full.l25F3Z52.png)_Configure sync settings_
          
       2. Click **Save**.
          
       
    3. Review the impact of sync configuration changes.
       
       > **FULL RE-SYNC BEHAVIOR**
       > 
       > Changing the **Sync mode** or **Change tracking column** triggers a full re-sync of the affected table on the next pipeline run.
       > 
       > During a full re-sync, the pipeline reloads all records for that table. This process may increase runtime and reprocess existing data in the destination.
       
14. Click **Add object** again to add additional tables using the same flow.
    
15. Use the **Choose how to handle schema changes** drop-down menu to select a schema drift handling option:
    
    - **Auto-sync new fields**: Automatically detects and syncs new fields added in the source.
    - **Block new fields**: Keeps the schema fixed after the pipeline starts. You must add new fields manually. This option may cause the destination to fall out of sync if the source schema updates.
    
    Refer to [Schema replication and schema drift management](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/concepts#schema-drift) for more information.
    
16. Choose either a standard time-based schedule or define a custom cron expression in the **Frequency** field. This determines how often the pipeline syncs data from Oracle to the destination.
    
    **Time-based schedule**
    
    1. Select the **Time unit**, such as **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**.
       
    2. Specify the sync interval in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       For example, the pipeline syncs every 6 hours if you select **Hours** as the **Time unit** and enter `6` in the **Trigger every** field.
       
       The minimum interval you can set is 15 minutes.
       
    3. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    4. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    
    **Cron-based scheduling**
    
    1. Use the **Time unit** drop-down menu to select **Custom schedule**.
       
    2. Enter an expression in the **Cron expression** field using the format:
       
       ```text
       [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]
       ```
       
       The minimum interval for cron schedules is 15 minutes.
       
       For example, enter the following expression to sync every day at 8:00 AM UTC:
       
       ```text
       0 8 * * *
       ```
       
    3. Optional. Select a **Timezone** for the cron expression. Leave blank to use `Etc/UTC`.
       
    4. Select a start date for the historical data sync in the **When first started, this pipeline should pick up records from** field. This defines the earliest date from which the pipeline extracts records. The pipeline picks up all available records from the source if you leave this field blank.
       
       You can't change this value after you run the pipeline.
       
    5. Click **Save** to save your progress before you [configure your data pipeline destination](/en/data-orchestration/data-pipeline-recipe/configure-pipeline-destinations#configure‒how‒data‒is‒loaded‒in‒the‒workato‒data‒pipeline).
       
    

## Supported Oracle tables

The Oracle connector supports most tables available in the connected Oracle database instance. Workato retrieves table metadata and schema information from the Oracle database to populate available objects during pipeline configuration.

The tables available for selection depend on:

- The schema configured in the Oracle database
- The permissions granted to the database user used for the connection
