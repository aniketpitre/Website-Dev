> Extract data from SaaS apps, databases, and file systems in Workato using event-driven, bulk, and batch methods for ETL and ELT pipelines.

# Extract data

Data extraction enables you to retrieve information from different applications. Workato supports both bulk and batch extraction, which are essential for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) processes.

## Event or trigger-based extraction

Event-driven or trigger-based extraction in Workato allows data to be extracted automatically when specific events occur in source systems. This approach is ideal for scenarios where data must be processed immediately after an event, such as creating or updating a record.

You can configure event-driven or trigger-based data extraction to monitor events in [real-time](/en/recipes/triggers#real-time-triggers) or at [specified intervals](/en/recipes/triggers#polling-triggers). This ensures timely data capture and processing, keeps your data up to date, supports real-time analytics, and triggers automated workflows with minimal latency.

Use event or trigger-based extraction to extract data in [bulk](/en/recipes/triggers#bulk-triggers) or [batches](/en/recipes/triggers#batch-triggers) from the following sources:

- [Software as a service (SaaS) applications](/en/data-orchestration/extract-data#saas)
- [Databases](/en/data-orchestration/extract-data#databases)
- [File systems](/en/data-orchestration/extract-data#file-systems)

### SaaS

SaaS applications store critical business data in the cloud, including customer, sales, and operational information. You can use Workato to extract this data based on events or schedules to synchronize it with data warehouses, analytics platforms, and other applications.

#### Sample recipe: Batch extraction from Salesforce

This example demonstrates how to batch extract new or updated records from Salesforce and load them into Snowflake.

![Batch extraction recipe](/assets/di-cdc-batch-salesforce.B2bbgMYF.png)_Batch extraction from Salesforce_

Complete the following steps to extract Salesforce records in batches and load them into Snowflake:

1. Configure the New/updated records in Salesforce batch trigger.
   
   1. Choose the **Object** that contains the data you plan to extract. For example, select **Account** to extract new or updated account records.
      
      ![New/updated records trigger](/assets/record-sales-trigger.wgv4ltAk.png)_Configure the New/updated records batch trigger_
      
   2. Optional. Choose **Related objects** to extract additional fields. After you select related objects, specify the fields to retrieve.
      
   3. Select specific **Fields to retrieve** to improve performance. If left blank, Workato retrieves all fields.
      
   4. Optional. Enter a SOQL query in the **SOQL WHERE clause** field to refine results. For example, you can use the query `StageName = 'Closed Lost' AND IsClosed = false` to extract records where `StageName` is set to `Closed Lost` and `IsClosed` is `false`. This retrieves deals marked as lost but not fully closed, allowing further processing.
      
   5. Optional. Set the **Batch size** to control how many records are extracted in each batch. The maximum number of records per batch is 2,000, but Workato may reduce this quota depending on the record size. The default batch size is 100.
      
   6. Optional. Use the **Detect new or updated custom data** field to specify whether to include newly added or modified custom fields in the trigger output.
      
   7. Choose the starting point for data extraction in the **When first started, this recipe should pick up events from** field. Select a relative time or a specific date and time. You can't change this value after you run or test the recipe.
      
   
2. Configure the Upsert rows action.
   
   1. Choose the Snowflake **Table** where Workato upserts the extracted records. If the table is not listed, enter the table name manually.
      
      ![New/updated records action](/assets/upsert-sales-action.Bq3aHhQ_.png)_Configure the Upsert rows batch action_
      
   2. Map the list datapill for your specified object in the **Rows source list** field. For example, if extracting accounts in batches from Salesforce, map the Accounts (Step 1) datapill. After mapping a list datapill, map each corresponding datapill from Salesforce to the appropriate **Rows fields** in the Snowflake action.
      
   3. Optional. Choose a **Unique key** column to deduplicate rows. This improves performance and ensures Workato updates existing records instead of creating duplicates. Performance can be improved if the unique key is indexed.
      
   

### Databases

Databases store structured data essential for analytics, reporting, and operational processes. Workato enables you to extract, transform, and load (ETL) or extract, load, and transform (ELT) data from databases into cloud storage, data warehouses, and other applications.

Workato supports two primary database extraction methods:

**Bulk extraction**

Bulk extraction moves large datasets in a single operation and maximizes throughput and efficiency. You can use bulk extraction for full data loads, historical data migrations, or large-scale syncs that require high-speed data transfers.

Workato supports bulk extraction for the following database connectors:

- [Snowflake](/en/connectors/snowflake)
- [PostgreSQL](/en/connectors/postgresql)
- [MySQL](/en/connectors/mysql)

**Batch extraction**

Batch extraction captures new or updated records in smaller, incremental groups. This method supports near-real-time synchronization between systems while handling large volumes of data during scheduled transfers.

Workato supports batch extraction for the following database connectors:

- [Snowflake](/en/connectors/snowflake)
- [SQL Server](/en/connectors/mssql)
- [PostgreSQL](/en/connectors/postgresql)
- [Oracle](/en/connectors/oracle)
- [MySQL](/en/connectors/mysql)
- [Redshift](/en/connectors/redshift)

The following examples demonstrate how to extract data from PostgreSQL and load it into Snowflake using both methods.

#### Sample recipe: Scheduled bulk extraction from a database

This example demonstrates how to bulk extract large datasets from PostgreSQL and load them into Snowflake. Bulk extraction transfers data at scheduled intervals to improve efficiency and optimize performance for analytics and reporting.

![Bulk extraction from database recipe](/assets/di-cdc-bulk-extract-db.CsxZDNTo.png)_Bulk extraction from PostgreSQL_

Complete the following steps to extract PostgreSQL records in bulk and load them into Snowflake:

1. Configure a **Scheduler** trigger to define how often Workato extracts data.
   
2. Configure the Export query result bulk action
   
   1. Define a `SELECT` query to retrieve the required data in the SQL field. For example, the following query extracts account records updated in the last 24 hours:
      
      ```sql
      SELECT id, name, updated_at FROM accounts WHERE updated_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
      ```
      
      ![Export query result action](/assets/export-query-sql-action.Cv41BIUQ.png)_Configure the Export query result action_
      
   2. Choose a **Column delimiter** to separate values in the exported CSV file. The most common option is **comma (`,`)**, but you can select other delimiters based on system requirements.
      
   3. Define the **Timeout limit (minutes)** for the action. If the query execution exceeds this limit, Workato proceeds to the next step. The default value is **60 minutes**, with a maximum of **120 minutes**.
      
   
3. Configure the Amazon S3 Upload file action
   
   1. Select the bucket where you plan to upload the file from the **Bucket name** drop-down menu.
      
      ![Configure the Upload file action](/assets/upload-file-s3-action.CfbM4wjR.png)_Configure the Upload file action_
      
   2. Define the path where you plan to upload the file in the **Object name** field. For example, `subfolder001/subfolder002/filename.csv` saves the file in `subfolder002` inside `subfolder001` within the selected bucket. This field is case-sensitive.
      
   3. Map the PostgreSQL File contents (Step 2) datapill to the **Contents** field.
      
   4. Optional. Set the **Use accelerated endpoint** field to `true` to use S3 transfer acceleration, which speeds up file uploads over long distances. Ensure the target bucket has **Transfer acceleration** enabled in AWS.
      
   5. Optional. Choose a **Canned ACL** to define access permissions for the uploaded file.
      
   
4. Configure the Bulk load to table from stage action
   
   1. Choose the **Table** where Workato loads the extracted data. If the table is not listed, enter the table name manually.
      
      ![Configure the Bulk load to table from stage action](/assets/bulk-load-snowflake-action.CFxKU70x.png)_Configure the Bulk load to table from stage action_
      
   2. Choose the **Stage name** that references the Amazon S3 location where the files are stored.
      
   3. Enter a list of file names (comma-separated) in the **File name** field to load specific files from S3. If left blank, Workato loads all files from the selected stage.
      
   4. Select a **File format** that matches the structure of the uploaded files.
      
   

#### Sample recipe: Batch extraction from a database

This example demonstrates how to extract new or updated records from PostgreSQL in batches and load them into Snowflake.

![Batch extraction from database recipe](/assets/di-cdc-batch-extract-db.CpYAC-TN.png)_Batch extraction from PostgreSQL_

Complete the following steps to extract PostgreSQL records in batches and load them into Snowflake:

1. Configure the New/updated batch of rows in PostgreSQL trigger
   
   1. Choose the **Table** that contains the records you plan to extract. If the table is not listed, enter the table name manually.
      
      ![Configure the New/updated batch of rows in PostgreSQL trigger](/assets/sql-batch-rows-trigger.CcOwksBa.png)_Configure the New/updated batch of rows in PostgreSQL trigger_
      
   2. Select a **Unique key** column to deduplicate rows. Use a primary key or a column with a unique constraint to ensure no trigger events are missed. Indexing the column improves performance.
      
   3. Select a **Sort column** to identify updated rows. Only **timestamp** columns are supported. Use a high-precision timestamp (up to milliseconds) to prevent missing updates that occur in rapid succession.
      
   4. Enter the number of rows to return in each batch in the **Batch size** field. The default is 100, and the maximum is 1,000.
      
   5. Optional. Choose **Output columns** to specify the columns to retrieve. Leave blank to retrieve all columns.
      
   6. Optional. Define an SQL **WHERE condition** to filter records. For example, `currency = 'USD'` filters records where the currency field is USD. Ensure string values are enclosed in single quotes (').
      
   
2. Configure the Snowflake Upsert rows batch action
   
   1. Choose the **Table** where you plan to upsert the extracted records. If the table is not listed, enter the table name manually.
      
      ![Configure the Snowflake Upsert rows batch action](/assets/snowflake-upsert-rows-action.Bi40uvVB.png)_Configure the Snowflake Upsert rows batch action_
      
   2. Input a **list datapill** that contains records extracted from PostgreSQL in the **Rows source list** field. This defines the batch of rows to upsert. Workato automatically retrieves available fields from the selected table. You can map the corresponding datapills to match the schema.
      
   3. Choose a **Unique key** column to prevent duplicate records. Use a primary key or an indexed column to improve performance.
