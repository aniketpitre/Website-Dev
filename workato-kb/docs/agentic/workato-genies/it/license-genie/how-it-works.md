# How License Genie works

This page explains how the License Genie approval and downgrade processes work, and describes the project's folder structure.

## How approvals work

The scheduler creates entries in the **License Optimization Events** data table (in **Runtime Data**) on a cadence you configure. The approval workflow triggers for each new entry. The workflow includes two skills: single user approval for individual requests, and bulk approval for processing multiple escalated requests at once. Both skills require explicit user confirmation before License Genie can take any action.

### Single user approval

Single user approval handles a license optimization request for an individual user:

- Approving reclaims the license.
- Rejecting escalates the request to their manager, if manager approval is enabled; otherwise it escalates to an admin.
- If both manager and admin approval are disabled, the user's decision is final.

If user approval is disabled entirely, License Genie skips this step and applies the configured default action.

**Approve**

**Reject**

### Bulk approval

Bulk approval lets managers or admins handle all escalated requests in a single interaction rather than one at a time. A manager receives all pending approvals for their direct reports at once.

Both skills use the **License Optimization Approvals** data table (in **Runtime Data**) as a shared audit trail, tracking status, assignee, event ID, and rejection reasons across every decision.

## How downgrades work

The downgrade process follows four stages: detection, recommendation, approval, and execution.

### Detection

License Genie periodically analyzes usage data for licensed users in an application. It compares each user's activity against their current license tier to identify users who aren't using their full license.

### Recommendation

License Genie evaluates each detected user against the **Application License Inventory** and **License Optimization Events** data tables, which together provide available tiers, their hierarchy, and SSO group IDs. License Genie produces a list of eligible downgrade options for each user, showing the tiers available below the one currently assigned to them. **FUNC | License Downgrade Recommendation Engine** determines the appropriate target tier based on the configured hierarchy and rank.

### Approval

Each recommendation enters the approval workflow described in [How approvals work](#how-approvals-work). Execution begins after an approver confirms the downgrade.

### Execution

After approval, License Genie updates the user's license assignment by modifying their SSO group membership. It removes the user from the current tier group and adds them to the approved target tier group. Both group IDs are sourced from the **Application License Inventory** and **License Optimization Events** data tables. For apps that support provisioning through their own API without SSO, License Genie uses that path instead.

## Folder structure

The License Genie project is organized into the following top-level folders:

- **Config**: Connections and metadata required to run License Genie.
- **Core**: Foundational skills maintained by Workato. You can't modify or clone these skills.
- **Extensions**: Additional app skills and functions maintained by Workato and updated during release cycles. You can use these as-is or as a reference when you build custom integrations.
- **Custom Extensions**: Custom assets that you maintain. Clone Extension assets into this folder before you modify them. Assets in this folder remain intact across upgrades.
- **Runtime Data**: Data tables that store the data License Genie generates during runtime.

### Working with Extensions and Custom Extensions

You can activate Extension skills and add them to License Genie as-is. You can also clone them into **Custom Extensions** to customize them or build support for apps that aren't available in the **Extensions** folder.

Customizations in **Custom Extensions** are isolated from platform updates and remain intact across upgrades. You can't clone or modify core skills.
