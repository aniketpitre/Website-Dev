# Set up IT Support Genie

Use this guide to install and configure IT Support Genie in your workspace.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following before beginning setup:

- Confirm that the Genie Installer is already installed in your workspace. Contact your Workato account team to complete this one-time setup if it isn’t already installed.
- Connect either Okta or Microsoft Entra ID as your identity provider. Don't use both at once. Entra ID requires a P1 or P2 license. Provision your app licenses through this same SSO provider.
- If you plan to enable manager approval, ensure each user's manager can be looked up in Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, or Workday. Configure manager lookups in only one of these systems.
- Identify the group ID (Okta) or application role ID (Entra ID) for each license in each application before running provisioning workflows.
- Collect admin email addresses for each application and license name. Separate multiple addresses with commas.
- Choose a notification channel for user-facing messages: Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Workato GO.

For example, if you're using Jira Service Desk, start only the recipes that are in the folder **Agentic | IT Support Genie > Core > Ticketing > Jira Service Desk**.
   
6. Click **Start genie**.
   

> **SETUP COMPLETE**
> 
> IT Support Genie is now configured. Use [Activate and test](#activate-and-test) to confirm it's working, or [Extend IT Support Genie](#extend-it-support-genie) to add knowledge base content and custom skills.

## Extend IT Support Genie

You can extend IT Support Genie to ingest knowledge, configure manager lookups, and build custom skills. All steps in this section are optional, except where noted.

The **Core** folder holds the genie's foundational logic and is read-only. You extend the genie through the **Extensions** and **Custom Extensions** folders without changing its default behavior.

### Knowledge ingestion

Complete the following steps to make IT policies, runbooks, documentation, or tickets and request history available to IT Support Genie:

1. Go to **Agentic | IT Support Genie > Extensions > Knowledge Ingestion**, select the folder for your source app, and start the required recipes in that folder. IT Support Genie supports Confluence, Google Drive, Jira Service Desk, and ServiceNow as ingestion sources.
   
2. Add the corresponding knowledge base to the genie.
   
3. Add an entry to the **Config > Metadata > Data Ingestion | Scheduler**. Refer to [Configure metadata](#configure-metadata).
   
4. Go to **Agentic | IT Support Genie > Extensions > Functions** and ensure the recipe **FUNC | Data Ingestion Jobs (Data Table)** is started.
   

After the recipes are started, a background scheduler syncs content from the source system into the genie's knowledge base at regular intervals, using full and delta loads. This doesn't create or modify records in the source system.

### Manager lookup

If manager approval is enabled, configure the **Get Manager Details** function so IT Support Genie can route approvals to managers. This step is required when manager approval is enabled.

1. Go to **Agentic | IT Support Genie > Extensions > Functions** and select **FUNC | Get Manager Details**.
   
2. Connect the function to your organization's provisioning app.
   
3. Unskip the steps for your provisioning app. All other steps are skipped by default.
   
   | Provisioning app | Action |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Okta** | Unskip steps 3–9 |
   | **Microsoft Entra ID** | Unskip steps 10–13 |
   | **Workday** | Unskip steps 14–19 |
   

> **CUSTOM PROVISIONING APPS**
> 
> If your provisioning app isn't listed above, this function may need additional configuration. Clone this function into **Custom Extensions** to build your own version. Contact your Workato admin or refer to the [connector documentation](/en/connectors) for your app.

### Custom extensions

The **Custom Extensions** folder is where you build new skills or modify existing Extension skills. Clone assets from the **Extensions** folder into **Custom Extensions** before making changes.

Complete the following steps to build a custom skill:

1. Go to **Agentic | IT Support Genie > Custom Extensions > \[App Name\]**. Templates for new apps are already configured.
   
2. Rename the folder and skill to match the app name.
   
3. Add the skill to IT Support Genie.
   

## Activate and test

Complete the following steps to confirm your setup.

1. Add the genie to your Microsoft Teams or Slack workspace, then open the chat interface.
   
2. Start a new conversation with the genie.
   
3. Log in using [Workato Identity](/en/workato-identity).
   
4. Enter `Who are you?` in the chat. IT Support Genie greets you by name, confirms its name, and describes its role.
