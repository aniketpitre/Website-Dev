> Step-by-step instructions for setting up HR Self Service Genie, including package installation, Workday connections, project properties, and genie activation.

# Set up HR Self Service Genie

Use this guide to install and configure HR Self Service Genie in your workspace.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following before you begin setup:

- Confirm that the Genie Installer is already installed in your workspace. Contact your Workato account team to complete this one-time setup if it isn't already installed.
- Have access to a Workday tenant with the HR domains and business processes configured for the self-service capabilities you plan to deploy.
- Create a Workday Integration System User (ISU) with the domain security permissions required by the operations you enable, including the Worker Data, Time Off, and Organization domains. Refer to [Configure connections](#configure-connections) for more information.
- Make sure users access the genie through an authenticated session. The genie resolves each request to an employee identity before applying employee and manager authorization boundaries.

Additionally, complete the following for each extension you plan to enable:

- **Employee information updates, employee lookup, or worker documents**: Have a Workday Web Services connection available.
- **Employee information updates**: Prepare the mandatory fields and reference values for your Workday tenant and countries. Refer to [Configure Workday validation fields](#configure-workday-validation-fields) for more information.
- **HR ticketing**: Have a Jira Service Management tenant with an HR service project, configured request types and required fields, and permissions to create and retrieve tickets.
- **HR knowledge Q&A**: Have a Confluence connection and a space that contains the approved HR policies and documentation to ingest.

## Configure connections

Complete the following steps to configure your connections:

1. Review the requirements for each app you plan to use and complete any required configuration before creating its connection.
   
   Workday REST
   
   This connection is required. The core skills use it to look up employee profiles and organization details, handle time off, find managers and direct reports, and process approvals.
   
   Refer to the [Workday connector documentation](/en/connectors/workday#connection-setup) for connection details.
   
   | Capability | Domain security permissions | Access |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | **All operations** | Integration Debug, Integration Build, Integration Process, Integration Event, Worker Data: Public Worker Reports, Workday Query Language | Get for all, except Workday Query Language, which requires View and Modify. |
   | **Employee profile** | Worker Data: Workers, Worker Data: Staffing, Person Data: Personal Information, Person Data: Work Email | Get and Put |
   | **Time off** | Worker Data: Time Off (Time Off Balances), Worker Data: Time Off (Time Off), Worker Data: Time Off (Time Off Manager View), Process: Enter or Correct Time | Get and Put |
   | **Worker documents** | Worker Data: Add Worker Documents, Worker Data: Edit and Delete Worker Documents | Get and Put |
   | **Organizations** | Organization: Supervisory Organization, Organization: Cost Center, Organization: Region, Organization: Custom Organization, Organization: Company, Manage: Organization Integration, Set Up: Organization, Process: Organization, Manage: Organization Roles, Manage: Organization Integration Documents, Reports: Organization | Get and Put |
   
   Grant the ISU permission to initiate the following business processes: **Change Personal Information**, **Adjust Time Off**, and **Enter Time Off**.
   
   An operation can fail because of a missing permission. Find it by searching for **View Security for Securable Item** in Workday and entering the endpoint or field. The result identifies the required security domain, access type, and scope.
   
   Workday Web Services
   
   This connection is required only if you enable extension skills for employee name, contact, demographic, biographic, or identification updates, for employee lookup, or for worker documents. The ISU needs access to the Workday domains and business processes used by those operations. Refer to the [Workday connector documentation](/en/connectors/workday#connection-setup) for connection details.
   
   Confluence
   
   This connection is required to ingest HR knowledge from Confluence. Make sure it can access the spaces and pages you choose as sources. Refer to the [Confluence connector documentation](/en/connectors/confluence#connection-setup) for connection details.
   
   Jira Service Management
   
   This connection is required only if you enable HR ticketing. Make sure the connected account can access the HR project and its request types, create and read tickets, and add comments. Refer to the [Jira Service Desk connector documentation](/en/connectors/jsd#api-tokens) for connection details.
   
2. Go to **Agentic | HR Self Service Genie > Config > Connection** and configure a connection for each app you plan to use.
   

## Configure metadata

## Configure Workday validation fields

The genie validates each personal information update against the **Workday Validation Fields** knowledge base before it runs the update. The knowledge base holds the mandatory fields and allowed reference values for your Workday tenant.

> **OPTIONAL SECTION**
> 
> Complete this section if you plan to enable employee personal information updates.

### Validation field values

The following sections list the values the knowledge base needs. The values are the defaults for the USA. Edit any value that differs in your Workday tenant, and add values for each other country you support. Values differ by tenant and country.

#### Update contact data

Applies when updating an email address.

| Field | Mandatory | Default / allowed | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Type\_Reference** | Yes | Default: `HOME` | Set to `HOME` by default because the `WORK` address must not be updated. |
| **Primary** | Yes | `True` / `False` | The user must state whether the email address being updated is the primary one. |

#### Update name data

Applies when updating any part of a name.

| Field | Mandatory | Default / allowed | Details |

### Add the values to the knowledge base

The genie reads the validation values from a PDF in the **Workday Validation Fields** knowledge base. Complete the following steps to create the PDF and upload it:

1. Create a document that starts with your organization name, Workday tenant, completed-by details, and date. Add the tables from [Validation field values](#validation-field-values) with your edits and additions. Your Workato team can help you complete it.
   
2. Export the document as a PDF.
   
3. Go to **Agentic | HR Self Service Genie > Extensions > Knowledge Ingestion > Workday** and upload the PDF to the **Workday Validation Fields** knowledge base.
   
4. Confirm that the document is ingested and available to the genie before you enable the update skills.
   

## Configure HR reference letter message templates

HR Self Service Genie generates HR reference letters from Workato [message templates](/en/features/message-template). The packaged extension ships with a template for each supported letter type, already wired into the **get\_hr\_reference\_letters** skill. Customize their content before enabling the extension. Base them on your HR policies, branding, wording, and document requirements.

> **OPTIONAL SECTION**
> 
> Complete this section if you plan to enable HR reference letters.

Complete the following steps to customize the templates:

1. Go to **Tools > Message templates**.
   
2. Open each packaged HR reference letter template listed below.
   
3. Configure the letter content, formatting, static text, and dynamic employee fields in each template. Don't delete the templates, because the skill references them by ID.
   

The packaged extension includes the following templates:

| Message template | Letter type |
| --- | --- |
| **HR Letters | Employment Verification Letter | Template** | Employment Verification Letter |
| **HR Letters | No Objection Certificate | Template** | No Objection Certificate |
| **HR Letters | Business Employment Verification Invitation | Template** | Business Visa Application – Employment Letter |
| **HR Letters | Business Invitation Letter | Template** | Business Visa Application – Invitation Letter |

> **CORE CONFIGURATION COMPLETE**
> 
> Core configuration is complete. [Extend HR Self Service Genie](#extend-hr-self-service-genie) to add HR knowledge, reference letters, HR ticketing, and custom skills, or go to [Activate and test](#activate-and-test) to start the genie and confirm it works.

## Extend HR Self Service Genie

You can extend HR Self Service Genie with optional capabilities. The steps in this section are not required to start or use the core genie. Complete the sections for the capabilities you plan to use before you start the genie.

The **Core** folder contains the genie's foundational logic and is read-only. Extend the genie through **Extensions** and **Custom Extensions** without modifying the default behavior.

### Enable HR knowledge Q&A

Complete the following steps to make approved HR content, such as policies, benefits, and leave guidelines, available to the genie:

1. Go to **Agentic | HR Self Service Genie > Extensions > Knowledge Ingestion > Confluence** and start the required recipes.
   
2. Add an entry to **Config > Metadata > Data Ingestion | Scheduler**. Refer to [Configure metadata](#configure-metadata) for more information.
   
3. Set the entry's **Type** to `full` for the initial run, then add a `delta` entry for recurring synchronization.
   
4. Edit the genie and add the **Confluence | HR** knowledge base.
   
5. Go to **Agentic | HR Self Service Genie > Extensions > Knowledge Ingestion > Confluence** and start the **Log User Conversation** skill. Add the skill to the genie so it records questions that the knowledge base cannot answer. Review the **KB Gap User Conversations** data table in **Runtime Data** to identify HR content to add or update.
   

### Enable HR reference letters

Complete the following steps to let employees generate HR reference letters:

1. Go to **Agentic | HR Self Service Genie > Extensions > Skills > Workday SOAP** and start the **get\_hr\_reference\_letters** skill.
   
2. Add the HR reference letter skill, **get\_hr\_reference\_letters**, to HR Self Service Genie.
   
3. Confirm that the Workday connection can retrieve the employee and employment information required by the letter templates.
   
4. Set the **Extensions.FileStorageDirectoryPath** project property to the FileStorage directory for generated files. Select the same directory in each extension recipe that uses it, including **Periodic Cleanup of Worker Documents from FileStorage**. File creation, retrieval, and cleanup then use the same location.
   
5. Test each enabled letter type before making the capability available to users.
   

The packaged extension stores generated PDFs in [Workato FileStorage](/en/features/workato-filestorage). You can use another document-management system, such as Google Drive, by cloning the storage logic into **Custom Extensions** and configuring it there.

### Enable employee data and worker document extensions

Complete the following steps to enable the extensions that let employees update personal information, look up colleagues, and retrieve worker documents:

1. Configure the Workday Web Services connection and confirm that the ISU has the domain security permissions required by the operations you enable.
   
2. Confirm that you completed [Configure Workday validation fields](#configure-workday-validation-fields) if you enable the update skills.
   
3. Go to **Agentic | HR Self Service Genie > Extensions > Skills > Workday SOAP** and start the skills you need. Available skills cover employee name, contact, demographic, biographic, and identification updates, as well as employee lookup and worker-document listing and retrieval.
   
4. Add the started skills to the genie.
   
5. If you enable worker documents, set the **Extensions.FileStorageDirectoryPath** project property to the FileStorage directory for retrieved documents. Select the same directory in each extension recipe that uses it, including **Periodic Cleanup of Worker Documents from FileStorage**. File retrieval and cleanup then use the same location.
   

### Enable HR ticketing

Complete the following steps to let employees raise and track HR tickets in Jira Service Management:

1. Make sure the Jira Service Management connection can access your HR project. Refer to [Configure connections](#configure-connections) for more information.
   
2. Set the **JiraServiceDesk.hr.projects** project property to your HR project key.
   
3. Go to **Tools > FileStorage** and upload `hr_service_desk_request_types.json` to the root directory. The file lists the HR request types and their fields. It must match your Jira project, including its service desk ID, request type IDs, and required fields. The **List Request Types & Fields** recipe reads the file from the root directory. Update the file reference in the recipe if you store the file elsewhere.
   
4. Go to **Agentic | HR Self Service Genie > Extensions > Ticketing > Apps > Jira Service Desk** and start the ticketing recipes.
   
5. Add the following skills to the genie: **List Open Requests of a User**, **Get Jira Service Desk Issue Details**, **Check For Known Problem**, **List Request Types & Fields**, **Create HR Request**, and **Add Comment to Jira Service Desk Issues**.
   
6. Test ticket creation, retrieval, and comments with an authenticated employee account.
   

### Custom extensions

Go to **Agentic | HR Self Service Genie > Custom Extensions**. Use this folder to develop new skills and integrations, customize cloned extension assets, or implement deployment-specific knowledge-ingestion patterns without modifying the packaged **Core** or **Extensions** folders.

For HR knowledge use cases, a reusable **Confluence KB partition** template is available in **Custom Extensions > Knowledge Ingestion > Templates > Confluence KB partition**. Use it to divide a large Confluence HR knowledge source into logical knowledge bases, such as by region, business unit, policy category, or content domain. Partitioning reduces the retrieval scope for each query and can improve response relevance and performance when one knowledge base contains a large volume of content.

Customize the template for your Confluence source and partitioning logic, configure the corresponding runtime and knowledge-base assets, and add the resulting knowledge bases to the genie.

For other custom requirements, create or adapt the assets you need in **Custom Extensions** and add the relevant skills to the genie. All custom implementations must preserve the genie's authentication, authorization, and employee-data access controls.

## Activate and test

Complete the following steps to verify your setup. Run extension steps only if you enabled the associated capability:

1. Go to **Agentic | HR Self Service Genie**, open the genie, and click **Start genie**.
   
2. Open the HR Self Service Genie app in your chat interface and start a new conversation.
   
3. Enter `Who are you?`. Confirm that the response names HR Self Service Genie and describes its HR self-service capabilities.
   
4. Enter `Show me my time-off balances.` Confirm that the genie returns balances for the authenticated employee.
   
5. Enter `I want to take annual leave from Monday to Wednesday next week.` Confirm that the genie gathers any missing details, checks the employee's balance, submits the request to Workday, and returns the resulting status.
   
6. Sign in as a manager and enter `Show me the pending time-off requests from my direct reports.` Then enter `Approve EMPLOYEE_NAME's time-off request.` Confirm that the manager can act only on confirmed direct reports.
   
7. Confirm that scheduled manager notifications, approval reminders, and employee status updates arrive in your chat interface. Include a request that was actioned directly in Workday.
   
8. Enter `What holidays are coming up?` Confirm that the genie returns location-specific holidays and, if HR knowledge Q&A is enabled, Global Days Off in one table.
   
9. Enter `What is our work-from-home policy?` Confirm that the response comes from your HR knowledge base. Run this step only if HR knowledge Q&A is enabled.
   
10. Enter `Raise an HR ticket for my missing payslip.` Confirm that the genie checks for known problems, collects the required fields, creates a ticket in Jira Service Management, and returns the ticket details. Then enter `Show me my open HR tickets.` and confirm that the response lists only your tickets. Run this step only if HR ticketing is enabled.
    
11. Test each enabled employee-data, employee-lookup, worker-document, or HR reference-letter skill with one supported request, and confirm that it completes successfully.
    
12. Enter `Cancel my pending annual leave request.` Confirm that the genie cancels the request you submitted earlier, so the test leaves no pending request in Workday.
