# AgentX Support - Core nodes

Core nodes are the foundational building blocks used in flows. These nodes handle common actions like sending messages, asking questions, making decisions, and launching guides.

## Start

The **Start** node marks the beginning of a conversation flow.

## Message

The **Message** node sends a message to the customer in the chat.

![Message](/assets/message.3TXYxDq1.png)_Message_

Use this node to provide information, instructions, or confirmations before continuing to the next step in the flow.

## Question

The **Question** node displays information to the customer and asks a question.

Use this node to gather input or guide the customer through decision points in the conversation.

![Question node](/assets/question.DfexWcLX.png)_Question node_

Click **+** to add content to the node. You can mix and match components to create clear, engaging questions:

- Text
- Rich text
- Link
- Image
- GIF
- IFrame
- Guide
- Video
- PDF

After adding the question content, you can configure quick replies. Quick replies are buttons the customer can select as a response. Use quick replies to route the customer to different paths in the flow.

## Rule

The **Rule** node adds conditional logic to a flow based on defined parameters.

Use this node when you plan for the AI agent to make decisions or branch the conversation depending on context, such as user input or external data.

![Rules](/assets/rules.dRfPcey7.png)_Rules_

### Define rule criteria

Each rule contains one or more conditions, evaluated together using either:

- **All conditions (AND)**: All conditions must be true for the rule to pass.
- **Any condition (OR)**: At least one condition must be true for the rule to pass.

![Define rule criteria](/assets/define-rule-criteria.Y0nYbu1F.png)_Define rule criteria_

Each condition includes:

- Field Name
- Operator
- Field Value

### Add conditions

| Operator | Description | Supported types |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Not Equals | Evaluates whether the field value doesn't match the specified value. | Number, Text, Boolean |
| Equals | Evaluates whether the field value matches the specified value. | Number, Text, Boolean |
| Greater Than | Evaluates whether the field value is greater than the specified number. | Number |
| Less Than | Evaluates whether the field value is less than the specified number. | Number |
| Contains | Evaluates whether the text field includes the specified substring. | Text |
| Is Not Empty | Evaluates whether the field has a value (not blank or empty). | Text, List |
| Is Empty | Evaluates whether the field is blank or contains no items. | Text, List |

## Sub Flow

The **Sub Flow** node embeds another flow within the current one.

Use this to reuse common conversation sequences or break large flows into smaller, more manageable components.

## Form

The **Form** node creates a custom form to collect structured input from the customer.

![Form node](/assets/form-node.CAsuqCqT.png)_Form node_

You can click **Edit** to edit the form.

This opens a drag-and-drop interface to design your form layout. You can add the following form components:

- Text Field
- Email
- Text Area
- Phone Number
- Number
- Date / Time
- Checkbox
- Select
- Radio
- File
- Button

### Example: Product support request form

This form collects user contact details and routes requests based on the selected issue type. It uses conditional logic to display relevant fields and supports file uploads for better support resolution.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full Name | Text Field | Required. |
| Email Address | Email | Required, validated email format. |
| Request Type | Select | Options: `Product Support`, `Billing`, and `Other`. |
| Product Serial Number | Text Field | _Shown only if_ Request Type = `productSupport`. |
| Description | Text Area | Optional, allows users to provide more context. |
| Upload Screenshot | File | Optional, for attaching images or documents. |
| Submit Request | Button | Sends the completed form data. |

## Guide

The **Guide** node references an existing guide within a flow.

This node supports three transitions depending on the customer's actions in the guide:

![Guide node transitions](/assets/guide-node-transitions.D65NmTGu.png)_Guide node transitions_

- **Solved**: The customer finishes the guide and reaches a solved step.
- **Unsolved**: The customer finishes the guide on an unsolved step.
- **Skipped**: The customer exits the guide early.

Use these transitions to define what happens next depending on the customer's experience.

## Guide Step

The **Guide Step** node allows you to create a step in a guide.

![Guide step](/assets/guide-step.CA-h5Vt7.png)_Guide step_

Each step can include the following components:

- Title and subtitle
- Step content (text, instructions)
- A question to prompt the user
- Media like images or video

> **NODE AVAILABILITY**
> 
> The **Guide Step** node is available only when building [guides](/en/agentic/agentx-support/guides). You can use the [Guide](#guide) node to embed an existing guide within a conversation flow.

## Solved

The **Solved** node marks the end of a successful guide interaction.

Reaching this node is tracked as a **successful interaction** in reporting.

![Solved](/assets/solved.DeVJGLAY.png)_Solved_

> **NODE AVAILABILITY**
> 
> The **Solved** node is available only when building [guides](/en/agentic/agentx-support/guides).

## Unsolved

The **Unsolved** node marks the end of a guide when the customer did not find a solution.

Reaching this node is tracked as an **escalated interaction**.

![Unsolved](/assets/unsolved.nWXDXmPX.png)_Unsolved_

> **NODE AVAILABILITY**
> 
> The **Unsolved** node is available only when building [guides](/en/agentic/agentx-support/guides).

## End

The **End** node marks the end of a conversation flow.

You can also use this node to transition to another flow if the user's intent suggests a different skill is more relevant. This allows the AI agent to pivot smoothly to another capability without restarting the entire conversation.
