### Limit Google Drive crawler scope

Workato GO integrates with Google Drive to support enterprise search and automation across your organization's documents. You can use the `google_drive.user_allowlist` property to limit the crawler scope to specific users' files and shared content.

You can use this property to enable the following:

- Limit indexing to a pilot group or specific departments.
- Restrict access to sensitive content for compliance.
- Reduce crawl volume for performance or privacy reasons.

The `google_drive.user_allowlist` property value is a comma-separated list of email addresses.

Complete the following steps to limit the crawler scope in Google Drive:

1. Sign in to your Workato GO account.
   
2. Expand the **Admin** menu in the sidebar and click **Advanced**.
   
3. Click **Add Organization Property**.
   
4. Enter `google_drive.user_allowlist` as the name for your property.
   
5. Enter a comma-separated list of email addresses as the allowlist property value. For example:
   
   ```
   alex@example.com,caroline@example.com,carlos@example.com
   ```
   
6. Click **Submit**.
