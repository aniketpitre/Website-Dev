> Add a Salesforce data source to Workato GO to index standard and custom objects and their permissions with hourly syncs for record search.

# Add a Salesforce data source to Workato GO

The Salesforce data source enables Workato GO to index Salesforce objects and associated permissions, sync updates multiple times per hour after the initial crawl, and support search across Salesforce records.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you meet the following requirements before you begin:

- You have a Workato GO admin account
- You configured a [Salesforce connection in Workato](/en/connectors/salesforce#how-to-connect-to-salesforce-on-workato) using OAuth 2.0 or JWT bearer authentication
- Your Salesforce connection has the permissions required to access the objects you plan to crawl

## Supported objects

The Salesforce data source supports standard and custom Salesforce objects. Ensure your Salesforce connection has read access to the objects you plan to index.

## Connection permissions

The Salesforce data source inherits the permissions of the Salesforce account used to authenticate the connection. The crawler can only index objects and fields that the connected account has permission to access. Records or fields hidden by object-level or field-level security settings in Salesforce don't appear in Workato GO search results.

Workato recommends using a dedicated integration user for the Salesforce connection. A dedicated user isolates crawler access from individual user accounts and ensures consistent permissions. Refer to [Required roles and permissions](/en/connectors/salesforce#roles-and-permissions-required-to-connect) for details on configuring permissions for your Salesforce connection.

## Configure the data source in Workato GO

Workato GO uses your existing Salesforce connection to crawl and index records. You must configure a [Salesforce connection in Workato](/en/connectors/salesforce#how-to-connect-to-salesforce-on-workato) before you add the data source. Existing Salesforce connections configured in Workato appear in the Workato GO data source setup for selection.

1. Sign in to Workato GO and go to **Data sources**.
