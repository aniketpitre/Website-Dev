> Configure Workato GO crawler failure notifications to email a list of recipients when a data source crawler fails to fetch content.

# Crawler failure notifications

Workato GO crawlers fetch data from connected sources, such as Google Drive, Confluence, Slack, and more. You can configure crawler notifications to send emails when a crawler fails.

## Configure notifications

You can create a property with a list of emails that receive crawler failure notifications in Workato GO.

Complete the following steps to configure crawler failure notifications:

1. Sign in to your Workato GO account.
   
2. Expand the **Admin** menu in the sidebar and click **Advanced**.
   
3. Click **Add Organization Property**.
   
4. Enter a name for your property. For example: `crawler.failure_notification_emails`
   
5. Enter the email addresses that should receive notifications. You must separate user email addresses with commas. For example:
   
   ```
   alex@example.com,caroline@example.com,carlos@example.com
   ```
   
6. Click **Submit**.
