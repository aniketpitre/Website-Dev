> Add a Highspot data source to Workato GO by enabling API access and providing your subdomain so agents can search Highspot content.

# Add a Highspot data source in Workato GO

You must enable Highspot API functionality and provide credentials to allow Workato GO to search Highspot content.

The Highspot crawler can't crawl the APIs to determine the specific permissions for admins. Highspot admins can access all crawled information in Workato GO search results, regardless of the actual permissions for individual content.

> **CONTACT HIGHSPOT SUPPORT FOR API ENABLEMENT**
> 
> You must contact the Highspot support team and request API instance enablement. Workato GO requires **User Impersonation** privileges to crawl spots.

You must provide your Highspot subdomain. Your Highspot instance subdomain is determined by the URL used to access that instance. For example, your subdomain is `acme` if your URL is `acme.highspot.com`.

Complete the following steps to add Highspot as a data source in Workato GO:
