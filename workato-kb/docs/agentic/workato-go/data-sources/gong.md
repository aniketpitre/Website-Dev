# Add a Gong data source to Workato GO

The Gong data source enables Workato GO to index Gong call transcripts, AI summaries, highlights, topics, interaction stats, and associated permissions. After the initial indexing, Workato GO syncs content and permission updates multiple times every hour. Each data source targets one Gong workspace.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following to use the Gong data source connector:

- Gong admin access to create an API integration in the Gong Admin Center.
- A Gong workspace in the tenant that the integration's OAuth user is a member of.

## Create a Gong API integration

Complete the following steps to create a Gong API integration on the Gong platform. You need the Client ID and Client Secret from this integration when you create a Gong connection in Workato.

1. Sign in to Gong as an admin.
   
2. Click the **Admin Center** icon in the Gong UI.
   
3. Go to the **Ecosystem** column and click **API**.
   
4. Click **Create Integration** and complete the following sub-steps to fill in the required fields:
   
   1. Enter a name for the integration in the **Name** field, such as `Workato GO`.
      
   2. Enter a description in the **Description** field.
      
   3. Enter a short description in the **Short description** field.
      
   4. Upload a 64x64px image (SVG, JPG, or PNG) for the **Small app logo**. A placeholder is acceptable for private OAuth integrations.
      
   5. Upload a 200x300px image (SVG, JPG, or PNG) for the **Large app logo**. A placeholder is acceptable for private OAuth integrations.
      
   6. Select **Shared access** in the **Authorization context** section. This integration accesses all company data according to its approved scopes.
      
      > **AUTHORIZATION CONTEXT**
      > 
      > You can't change the authorization context after you create the integration.
      
   7. Enable the required scopes in the **Required authorization scopes** section. Refer to the [Required OAuth scopes](#required-oauth-scopes) table for the complete list.
      
   8. Enter `https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback` in the **Redirect URI** field.
      
   9. Optional. Enter a URL in the **Link to privacy policy page** field.
      
   10. Enter a URL in the **Link to terms & conditions page** field.
       
   11. Enter a URL in the **Link to help article** field.
       
   12. Enter a URL in the **Link to page where authorization process begins** field.
       
   13. Enter the email for the integration user in the **Operations email** field.
       
   14. Enter your organization's domain(s) in the **Domains** field.
       
   15. Verify that the **iFrame Integration** toggle is off in the **Advanced Settings** section.
       
   16. Verify that the **Link Personalization** toggle is off in the **Advanced Settings** section.
       
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret**. You need these values when you create a Gong connection in Workato.
   
   > **STORE YOUR CREDENTIALS SECURELY**
   > 
   > Treat the Client Secret like a password. Store it in a secret manager and do not paste it into chat, tickets, or shared documents.
   

### Required OAuth scopes

Enable the following scopes when you create your Gong API integration:

| Scope | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `api:users:read` | User sync |
| `api:workspaces:read` | Workspace selection in the data source configuration |
| `api:calls:read:basic` | Call listing |
| `api:calls:read:transcript` | Full call transcripts |
| `api:calls:read:extensive` | AI summaries, highlights, topics, and interaction stats |
| `api:permission-profile:read` | Append Gong admins to every call's permission list |

## Create a Gong connection

Create a Gong connection in Workato before you add Gong as a data source in Workato GO. You must provide the Client ID and Client Secret from the Gong API integration you created in the [preceding steps](#create-a-gong-api-integration).

Complete the following steps to create a Gong connection:

1. Go to **Connections > Create > Connection** in the Workato platform.
   
2. Search for `Gong.io` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a descriptive name in the **Connection name** field.

4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the appropriate project folder.
   
5. Click **Advanced settings** to expand the section. This step is mandatory.
   
6. Configure the following fields under **Advanced settings**:
   
   1. Use the **Scopes** drop-down menu to select the same scopes you enabled in the [Required OAuth scopes](#required-oauth-scopes) table. The drop-down menu lists all available scopes. Select only the required scopes from the table and don't use **Select All**.
      
   2. Paste the value you copied from the Gong API integration in the **Client ID** field.
      
   3. Paste the value you copied from the Gong API integration in the **Client secret** field.
      
      > **DON'T SKIP ADVANCED SETTINGS**
      > 
      > You can connect to Gong without completing the **Advanced settings** fields, but the data source in Workato GO doesn't work correctly because of missing permissions. Complete these fields before you connect.
      
7. Click **Connect**.
   
8. Click **Allow** to grant Workato access to Gong.
   

## Add Gong as a data source

Complete the following steps to add Gong as a data source in Workato GO:

1. Sign in to your Workato GO account.
   
2. Expand the **Admin** menu in the sidebar and click **Data sources**.
   
3. Click **Add Data Source**. The **Add Data Source** page displays.
   
4. Select the **Gong** app.
   
   ![Add data source](/assets/add-gong.BO-XmcA3.png)_Add data source_
   
5. Enter a descriptive name in the **Name** field. This name is how the data source appears to all teammates in Workato GO.
   
   ![Configure Gong connection](/assets/configure-gong-source.CkaFZUud.png)_Configure Gong connection_
   
6. Click **Show setup instructions** to review the reference for connecting to Gong if needed. Complete the preceding sections of this guide before you proceed.
   
7. Use the **Select a connection** drop-down menu to select the connection you created in the preceding steps. Only connections with a green status indicator are healthy and ready to use. Connections with a pink or red indicator have authentication issues. Revisit the [Create a Gong connection](#create-a-gong-connection) section before you select them.
   
8. Configure the Gong workspace and crawl settings:
   
   1. Use the **Workspace ID** drop-down menu to select the Gong workspace to scope the crawl to. Each data source targets one workspace. If the drop-down menu is empty, the connection is missing the `api:workspaces:read` scope. Revisit the [Required OAuth scopes](#required-oauth-scopes) section.
      
   2. Enable the **Allow call crawl** toggle to include Gong calls in the crawl.
      
   3. Enable the **Allow user crawl** toggle to include Gong users in the crawl. This is required for permissions on call documents.
      
9. Click **Next** and complete any remaining setup prompts.
   

### Verify the data source

Run the **Connection Test** on the data source after you save your configuration. All checks must show **Success**:

| Check | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Search Calls API | Success |
| Search Users API | Success |
| Search Call Transcripts API | Success |
| Permission Profiles API | Success |

> **PERMISSION PROFILES ERROR**
> 
> If the **Permission Profiles API** check shows `errorCode 422: execution_error`, the connection is likely using the default OAuth app or is missing the `api:permission-profile:read` scope. Disconnect the connection, verify that your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are set, ensure the scope is enabled on the Gong platform, and reconnect.
