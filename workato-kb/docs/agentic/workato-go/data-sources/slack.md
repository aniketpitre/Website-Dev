> Add Slack as a Workato GO data source with a custom OAuth profile to enable real-time federated search across workspace messages.

# Add a Slack data source to Workato GO

Slack federated search enables users to search Slack workspace messages in real time alongside other data sources in a unified search experience. Unlike indexed data sources, Slack search queries the Slack API with end-user OAuth credentials when a user performs a search, which prevents data leakage. Slack only permits federated search.

This data source configuration and search experience integrates Workato connector actions and runtime connections.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following to use the Slack data source connector:

- An existing parent connection in Workato to add Slack as a data source in Workato GO.
- A custom OAuth profile for Slack. Refer to [Custom OAuth profiles for Slack](/en/connectors/slack/custom-oauth) for more information.

## Create a custom OAuth profile

Complete the following steps to create a custom OAuth profile for Slack:

1. Sign in to your Workato account.
   
2. Go to **Tools > Custom OAuth profiles**.
   
3. Click **\+ New custom profile**.

4. Use the **Application** drop-down menu to select `Slack`.
   
5. Provide a name for your custom profile in the **Name** field.
   
6. Click **Create an app**. This opens the Slack API page in a new window. Keep Workato and Slack open, as you need both to complete the following steps.
   
7. Sign in to your Slack workspace if prompted, then select **Create an App**.
   
8. Choose how to configure your app's scopes and settings:
   
   **From a manifest**
   
   1. Use the **Pick a workspace to develop your app in** drop-down menu to select a workspace.

   2. Verify or edit the manifest configuration and click **Next**.
      
   3. Review the summary and click **Create**.
      
   
   **From scratch**
   
   1. Enter a name in the **App Name** field.
      
   2. Use the **Pick a workspace to develop your app in** drop-down menu to select a workspace.

   3. Click **Create App**.
      
   
9. Go to the **App Credentials** section of the Slack **Basic Information** page, copy the following credentials and enter the values in the corresponding fields in Workato:
   
   - **Client ID**
   - **Client secret**
   - **Signing Secret**
10. Click **Save**.
    

## Configure your Slack app

You must configure redirect URLs, interactivity, and user token scopes in the Slack API platform after you create your custom OAuth profile.

### Configure redirect URLs

3. Click **Save URLs**.
   

### Configure interactivity and shortcuts

Complete the following steps to configure interactivity and shortcuts:

1. Go to **Interactivity & Shortcuts > Interactivity** and turn it on in the Slack API platform.
   
2. Paste the following URL into the **Request URL** field:
   
   ```text
   https://www.workato.com/slack_webhooks/actions?sa_scope=adapter&coak_id=38630
   ```
   
3. Click **Save Changes**.
   

### Configure user token scopes

Complete the following steps to configure your user token scopes:

1. Go to **OAuth & Permissions > Scopes > User Token Scopes** in the Slack API platform.

3. Return to the Workato platform and click **Done**.
   

## Create a Slack connection

Create a Slack connection in Workato before you add Slack as a data source in Workato GO. End users establish their own runtime connections after the data source is configured.

Complete the following steps to create a Slack connection:

1. Go to **Connections > Create > Connection** in the Workato platform.
   
2. Search for `Slack` and select it as your app.
   
3. Enter a descriptive name in the **Connection name** field.
