> Add a SharePoint data source to Workato GO to index documents, pages, files, and permissions with hourly content and permission syncs.

# Add a SharePoint data source to Workato GO

The SharePoint data source enables Workato GO to index SharePoint documents, pages, files, and associated permissions. After the initial indexing, Workato GO syncs content and permission updates multiple times every hour. Connecting SharePoint as a data source allows your team to search across SharePoint site content directly from the Workato GO interface.

This data source configuration integrates Workato connector actions and runtime connections.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following to use the SharePoint data source connector:

- An Azure portal account with sufficient permissions to register applications in Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD).
- A Workato admin account in the GO workspace you plan to connect.

## Register the Workato app in the Azure portal

Complete the following steps to register the Workato app and obtain the required values for client credentials grant connections.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   
2. Go to **App registrations** and click **\+ New registration**.
   
3. Enter a unique name for the application.
   
4. Select **Accounts in this organizational directory only** in the **Supported account types** section. This is the recommended option for accessing organizational SharePoint data through client credentials.
   
   > **SUPPORTED ACCOUNT TYPES**
   > 
   > Select a different account type if your organization's requirements differ. Consult your Microsoft Entra ID administrator if you are unsure which option to select.
   
5. Use the **Select a platform** drop-down menu to select `Web`.
   
6. Enter `https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback` in the **Redirect URI** field.
   
7. Click **Register**.
   

## Assign API permissions to your app

Complete the following steps to assign the required API permissions to your registered app.

1. Go to **Manage > API permissions** in the navigation sidebar.
   
2. Add the Microsoft Graph application permissions. Click **\+ Add a permission > Microsoft Graph > Application permissions**, enable each permission listed in the [Required API permissions](#required-api-permissions) section, then click **Add permissions**.
   
3. Add the Microsoft Graph delegated permission. Click **\+ Add a permission > Microsoft Graph > Delegated permissions**, enable `User.Read`, then click **Add permissions**.
   
4. Add the SharePoint application permissions. Click **\+ Add a permission > SharePoint > Application permissions**, enable each permission listed in the [Required API permissions](#required-api-permissions) section, then click **Add permissions**.
   
5. Click **Grant admin consent** to authorize all permissions for your organization.
   
6. > **ADMIN CONSENT**
   > 
   > If your Azure account doesn't have an admin role, ask the Microsoft Entra ID administrator in your workspace to provision the scopes to your app on your behalf.
   

### Required API permissions

Your registered app requires permissions from both Microsoft Graph and SharePoint. The following tables list the specific permissions you must enable for each service.

#### Microsoft Graph (Application permissions)

Enable the following application permissions for Microsoft Graph:

| Permission | Description | Admin consent required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Directory.Read.All` | Read directory data | Yes |
| `RoleManagement.Read.All` | Read role management data for all RBAC providers | Yes |
| `RoleManagement.Read.Directory` | Read all directory RBAC settings | Yes |
| `Sites.Manage.All` | Create, edit, and delete items and lists in all site collections | Yes |
| `Sites.Read.All` | Read items in all site collections | Yes |
| `User.Read.All` | Read all users' full profiles | Yes |

#### Microsoft Graph (Delegated permissions)

Enable the following delegated permission for Microsoft Graph:

| Permission | Description | Admin consent required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `User.Read` | Sign in and read user profile | No |

#### SharePoint (Application permissions)

Enable the following application permissions for SharePoint:

| Permission | Description | Admin consent required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Sites.FullControl.All` | Have full control of all site collections | Yes |
| `Sites.Read.All` | Read items in all site collections | Yes |
| `Sites.ReadWrite.All` | Read and write items in all site collections | Yes |
| `User.Read.All` | Read user profiles | Yes |

## Obtain the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID

You need these values when you configure the SharePoint connection in Workato.

1. Go to the **Overview > Essentials** section of your registered app in the Azure portal.
   
2. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**. Save these values for use when you configure the SharePoint connection in Workato.
   
   > **STORE YOUR CREDENTIALS SECURELY**
   > 
   > Treat these IDs like credentials. Store them securely and don't paste them into chat, tickets, or shared documents.
   

## Generate a certificate and private key

You need a certificate and private key to authenticate using client credentials. You can generate these locally using OpenSSL or PowerShell.

Complete the following steps to generate a self-signed certificate with OpenSSL:

1. Open a terminal or another CLI (command-line interface) tool.
   
2. Create a 2048-bit RSA private key named `domain.key`:
   
   ```shell
   openssl genrsa -out domain.key 2048
   ```
   
3. Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) named `domain.csr` from the private key. Provide values for the required fields when prompted:
   
   ```shell
   openssl req -key domain.key -new -out domain.csr
   ```
   
4. Create a self-signed certificate named `domain.crt` with your private key and CSR:
   
   ```shell
   openssl x509 -signkey domain.key -in domain.csr -req -days 365 -out domain.crt
   ```
   
5. Open `domain.crt` and copy the entire certificate string, including the `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` lines. Use this as your **Certificate** value in Workato.
   
6. Open `domain.key` and copy the entire private key string, including the `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----` lines. Use this as your **Private key** value in Workato.
   
7. Go to **Manage > Certificates & secrets > Certificates** in the Azure portal.
   
8. Click **Upload certificate** and select the `domain.crt` file.
   
9. Enter a description for the certificate.
   
10. Click **Add**.
    

## Create a SharePoint connection

10. Use the **API scope** drop-down menu to select `SharePoint & Graph API`.
    
11. Paste the Directory (tenant) ID you copied from the Azure portal in the **Tenant ID** field.
    
12. Paste the Application (client) ID you copied from the Azure portal in the **Client ID** field.
    
13. Paste the certificate string you generated in the preceding steps in the **Certificate** field.
    
14. Paste the private key string you generated in the preceding steps in the **Private key** field.
    
15. Enter the name of your SharePoint site in the **Site name** field. Enter the name as it appears in the site URL. For example, if the URL is `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/sites/product`, the site name is `product`.
    
    > **SITE NAME**
    > 
    > Use this field if you only have access to a specific site but not the home site. If you leave this field blank, Workato connects to your default home site.
    
16. Optional. Use the **Custom OAuth profile** drop-down menu to select a custom OAuth profile for your connection.
