> Configure Workato GO with a custom subdomain and authenticate users with Workato Identity or your external identity provider (IdP).

# Workato GO configuration

You can configure Workato GO to use a custom subdomain and authenticate users with Workato Identity or your external identity provider (IdP).

## Configure your subdomain

You must have a Workato GO subdomain to provide end users with access to your Workato GO account. A unique, randomly generated subdomain is automatically provided for your Workato GO account. You can change this value to a custom subdomain.

Complete the following steps to configure your subdomain:

1. Sign in to your Workato account.
   
2. Go to **AI Hub** and click the **Workato GO** tab.
   
3. Click **Subdomain** in the sidebar.
   
4. Enter the subdomain you plan to use. For example, if you enter `acme-enhanced`, the URL your end users use to access the Workato GO portal is: `https://acme-enhanced.workato.ai`. Your subdomain must be greater than 3 characters and less than 65 characters. Alternatively, you can note or copy this value if you don't plan to provide a custom subdomain.

5. Click **Save**.
   

## Configure your branding

You can use branding properties to add a custom company name and logo to your Workato GO account. Customized branding is optional. Your Workato GO account displays the default branding if you don't configure a custom name and logo.

6. Optional. Enter a description in the **Description** field.

Complete the following steps to add a custom logo to your Workato GO account:

1. Sign in to your Workato GO account.
   
2. Expand the **Admin** menu in the sidebar and click **Advanced**.
   
3. Click **Add Organization Property**.
   
4. Enter `ui.branding_logo` in the **Name** field.

## User authentication
