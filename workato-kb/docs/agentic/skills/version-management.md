> Manage skill version history to review changes, compare versions, roll back, and run test cases without disrupting dependent genies or MCP servers.

# Skill version management

Skills maintain a full version history as you iterate on their logic, inputs, and outputs. Each time a skill is saved, a new version is created and attributed to the user who made the change, along with a timestamp and change type.

You can use version history to review what changed, compare versions side by side, roll back to a previous version, and run test cases against a specific version. This lets you safely iterate on a skill's behavior without disrupting the genies or MCP servers that depend on it.

## Change types

Workato logs two types of changes: Skill changes made by collaborators and schema changes detected automatically.

### Skill changes

Skill changes are logged when a user actively modifies the skill, such as adding or removing steps, updating field mappings, or changing the skill's input and output schema.

### Schema changes

Schema changes are logged when Workato detects that the underlying schema of a connected app has changed, for example when a new custom field is added to a Salesforce object used in the skill. Schema changes are logged automatically without any action from the builder.

## View version history

To view a skill's version history:

1. Open the skill.
   
2. Click the **Versions** tab.
   
   Each version displays the version number, date created, change type, the collaborator who made the change, and an optional comment.

## Compare versions

The **Recipe Diff** feature lets you visually compare two skill versions and review the changes. Refer to [Compare versions with Recipe Diff](/en/recipe-development-lifecycle/compare-versions-with-recipe-diff) for more information.

## Restore a version

1. Open the skill and click the **Versions** tab.
   
2. Click a non-current version to open the **Version details** page.
   
3. Click **Restore this version**.
   
4. Click **Yes** to confirm.
   

The selected version is copied and becomes the current version of the skill. Any genies or MCP servers assigned to this skill will use the restored version on their next invocation.

## Version management across environments

Skills are deployed as part of projects across development, test, and production [environments](/en/features/environments). Refer to [Agent version management](/en/agentic/agentic#agent-version-management) for more information on managing skill versions across environments.
