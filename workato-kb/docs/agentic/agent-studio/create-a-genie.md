   ```plaintext
   
   What's my job?
   Example: "You are a recruiting coordinator who schedules interviews and keeps candidates informed. Your goal is to reduce time-to-hire while ensuring a positive candidate experience."
   
   Who will need my help?
   Example: "Hiring managers need interview coordination, HR recruiters want automated communications, and job candidates need timely updates and interview details."
   
   How do I get things done?
   Example: "Check calendars first, propose 3 time slots, send invites once confirmed. Pull latest info from ATS for status updates. Always confirm details before acting and follow up within 24 hours."
   
   What should I avoid?
   Example: "Don't make hiring decisions, share salary ranges, or promise specific timelines. Never share candidate info between candidates. Escalate sensitive situations to hiring managers immediately."
   
   What results do you want me to track?
   Example: "Same-day interview scheduling, 90%+ candidate response rates within 48 hours, and hiring manager satisfaction scores."
   
   How should I talk to people?
   Example: "Be warm with nervous candidates, concise with busy hiring managers. Use 'your interview is scheduled' language and always include next steps."
   
   Any extra tips?
   Example: "Double-check calendar availability to avoid conflicts. Over-communicate with candidates rather than leaving them wondering. Keep common Q&A responses ready."

You can create skills to define workflows for your genie. This gives your genie different skills, such as starting a workflow or returning a response. Skills equip your genie with a comprehensive toolset to take action and respond to end users. Refer to [Design skills for databases](/en/agentic/skills/design-skills-for-databases) if you plan to use a database to store the data your genie references.

Genies can interpret text within document files and use this content in skills using the **File** input parameter type. This input passes file data to the recipe as a datapill.

Refer to [Create a skill with a File input parameter](/en/agentic/agent-studio/upload-files-and-images#create-a-skill-recipe-with-a-file-input-parameter) for more information.

Skills use [Verified user access](/en/agentic/agent-studio/verified-user-access) to allow each end user to authenticate with their own credentials when a skill runs. This ensures that the skill performs actions using the individual user's identity and permissions.

Your end users have the ability to manage their runtime user connection through the genie chat interface.

Skills can consume [MCP servers](/en/mcp). This enables you to access external APIs and integrate with third-party tools without custom skill development. Skills can call custom MCP servers and common provider MCP servers.

You can [share your skills in the Community Library](/en/community-library#community-library).

## Advanced features

Agent Studio includes the following advanced features to enhance your genie's abilities:

### Create an app event

App events enable genies to act proactively by responding to triggers from external systems, such as Salesforce or Zoom, instead of waiting for a user to initiate a conversation. These events help embed genies directly into existing workflows and allow genies to anticipate user needs and offer assistance without being prompted.

Refer to [Create an App event](/en/agentic/agent-studio/app-events#create-an-app-event) for more information.

### Create an approval request with Business approvals

Business approvals in Agent Studio let you build skills with approval workflows. Business approvals rely on the following actions:

- [**Create approval request**](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/workato-genie-connector/actions/create-approval-request): Use this action to create a new approval request in a data table you specify. The information from this request is shared with the user assigned to the approval task.
- [**Assign task to user**](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/workato-genie-connector/actions/assign-task-to-user): Use this action to assign a task to a user. The assignee receives a prompt within the chat interface you configured to approve or reject the request. The skill waits until the task is completed or expires.

Refer to [Business approvals](/en/agentic/agent-studio/business-approvals#business-approvals) for more information.

### Assign a task to a genie

Agent orchestration enables your genies to work autonomously within recipes. Recipes assign tasks to genies without user input. Genies process tasks while the recipe job runs.

Use the **Assign task to genie** action to assign a task to a genie. This enables your genie to trigger a recipe autonomously, perform the assigned task, and return a response.

Refer to [Assign task to genie action](/en/agentic/agent-studio/agent-orchestration#assign-task-action) for more information.

### Create a KPI and Action Board for Workato GO

A KPI (Key Performance Indicator) enables you to measure progress toward goals. KPIs can help highlight areas of success and areas that require improvement with your genies. The KPI tab is only visible on the **Overview** page of genies that use the Workato GO chat interface.

Refer to [Create a KPI](/en/agentic/agent-studio/action-board#create-a-kpi) for more information.
