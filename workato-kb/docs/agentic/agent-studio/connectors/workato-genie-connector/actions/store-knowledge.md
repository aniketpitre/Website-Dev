# Workato Genie connector - Store knowledge action

The **Store knowledge** action stores documents in a knowledge base. It runs as a batch action, processing all documents in the source list in a single operation.

Use this action to build knowledge base recipes that sync and update information from connected applications. Refer to [Knowledge base recipes](/en/agentic/agent-studio/knowledge-bases/knowledge-base-recipes) for full setup steps and [Knowledge base data ingestion](/en/agentic/agent-studio/knowledge-bases/data-ingestion) for ingestion best practices.

> **DEPRECATED**
> 
> The **Store knowledge** action is deprecated. It's replaced by the [Upsert documents](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/knowledge-base-connector/actions/upsert-documents) action in [Knowledge base by Workato](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/knowledge-base-connector/knowledge-base-connector), a dedicated connector for managing documents in a knowledge base.
> 
> Existing recipes that use the **Store knowledge** action continue to run unchanged. No immediate action is required. New knowledge base recipes use Knowledge base by Workato by default. Refer to [Migrate from the Store knowledge action](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/knowledge-base-connector/knowledge-base-connector#migrate-from-the-store-knowledge-action) for the field mapping.
