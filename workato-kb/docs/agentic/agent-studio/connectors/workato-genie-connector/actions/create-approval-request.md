# Workato Genie connector - Create approval request action

The **Create approval request** action creates a new approval request record in a data table you specify. The request information is shared with the user assigned to the approval task in the subsequent [Assign task to user](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/workato-genie-connector/actions/assign-task-to-user) action.

This action is used as part of [Business approvals](/en/agentic/agent-studio/business-approvals) workflows. Refer to that page for full setup steps and conditional outcome logic.
