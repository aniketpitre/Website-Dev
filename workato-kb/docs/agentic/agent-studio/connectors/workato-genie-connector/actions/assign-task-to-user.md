# Workato Genie connector - Assign task to user action

The **Assign task to user** action assigns a task to a user. The assignee receives a prompt in the genie's chat interface to approve or reject the request. The recipe waits until the task is completed or expires before proceeding to the next step.

This action is used as part of Business approval workflows. Refer to the [Business Approvals](/en/agentic/agent-studio/business-approvals) page for full setup steps and conditional outcome logic.

> **PREREQUISITE**
> 
> Users must be added to [Workato Identity](/en/workato-identity) before you can assign tasks to them. Refer to [Add an end user manually](/en/workato-identity/add-end-user-manually) for steps to add users individually.
