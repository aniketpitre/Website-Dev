# Workato Genie connector - Send business event action

The **Send business event** action sends a business event to a genie and delivers a notification to a specified user. The recipe continues immediately after sending the event without waiting for the genie to finish processing.

Use this action when a user needs to be informed of an event and may need to take action. Use the [Assign task to genie](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/workato-genie-connector/actions/assign-task-to-genie) action for automated tasks that don't require a user. Refer to [App Events vs Agent orchestration](/en/agentic/agent-studio/app-events-vs-agent-orchestration) for a full comparison.
