## Deprecated features

The following Workato Genie connector features are deprecated. These features continue to function in existing recipes but don't receive new enhancements:

- **Start workflow trigger**: The trigger used to define skills. Replaced by the [Workato Skill connector](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/workato-skill-connector/workato-skill-connector), which provides the same functionality without requiring access to genies. You can't add this trigger to new skills.
- **Return response action**: The action used to return a result from a skill. Replaced by the **Return response** action in the [Workato Skill connector](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/workato-skill-connector/workato-skill-connector).
- **Store knowledge action**: The action used to store documents in a knowledge base. Replaced by the [Upsert documents](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/knowledge-base-connector/actions/upsert-documents) action in [Knowledge base by Workato](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/knowledge-base-connector/knowledge-base-connector). Existing recipes continue to run unchanged. Refer to [Migrate from the Store knowledge action](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/knowledge-base-connector/knowledge-base-connector#migrate-from-the-store-knowledge-action) for the field mapping.
