# Knowledge base by Workato connector - List documents

The **List documents** action returns documents from a recipe or direct-upload [knowledge base](/en/agentic/agent-studio/knowledge-bases/knowledge-bases) you specify with optional filtering and pagination. Use the filters to narrow the list by content type, metadata, or date, and page through large result sets with the page number.

Use this action to audit, reconcile, or report on the documents in a knowledge base from within a recipe.
