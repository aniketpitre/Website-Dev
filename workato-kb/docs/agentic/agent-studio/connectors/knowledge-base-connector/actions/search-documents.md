# Knowledge base by Workato connector - Search documents

The **Search documents** action searches the knowledge base you specify by natural language or keyword search query.

The **Search documents** action runs a natural-language or keyword search across one or more [knowledge bases](/en/agentic/agent-studio/knowledge-bases/knowledge-bases) and returns the matching documents. Use the filters to narrow results by content type, metadata, or date.

You can select multiple knowledge bases in a single call. Each selected knowledge base is queried as a separate request. The request volume counted against your [rate limit](/en/connectors/knowledge-base-by-workato#limits) increases when you select more knowledge bases.
