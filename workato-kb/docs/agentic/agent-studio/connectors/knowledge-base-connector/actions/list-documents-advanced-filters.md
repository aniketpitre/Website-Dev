# Knowledge base by Workato connector - List documents advanced filters

The **List documents (advanced filters)** batch action returns documents from a recipe or direct-upload [knowledge base](/en/agentic/agent-studio/knowledge-bases/knowledge-bases) you specify with optional filtering and pagination. Use the filters to narrow the list by content type, metadata, or date, and page through large result sets with the page number. Filter metadata with a **data\_filters** JSON object to retrieve data that dedicated fields can't express, such as matching against a list of values, OR groups of conditions, or combining several conditions at once.

Refer to [Metadata filters](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/knowledge-base-connector/actions/metadata-filters) for more information on advanced filters.
