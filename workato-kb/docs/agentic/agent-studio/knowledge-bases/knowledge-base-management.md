> Manage content across Workato GO and custom genie knowledge bases to search, organize, remove documents, and track storage footprints.

# Knowledge base management

Knowledge base management gives you a centralized view to monitor and manage the content stored across your [Workato GO](/en/agentic/workato-go) and custom knowledge bases.

You can search, view, organize, and remove documents, track storage footprints, and manage file uploads to ensure your genie has access to accurate and up-to-date information. Storage footprint isn't supported for Workato GO.

Workato GO enforces its own permission model. Agent Studio uses this permission model to scope file visibility to your Workato GO identity and access level. This means you can only view content that you have permission to access in the connected data source. File visibility for third-party apps, such as Confluence, is also scoped to your identity permissions.
