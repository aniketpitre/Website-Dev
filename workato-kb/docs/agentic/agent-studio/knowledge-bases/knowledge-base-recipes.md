> Create a knowledge base recipe that syncs content from connected apps so your genie's knowledge base stays current with the latest data.

# Knowledge base recipes

Knowledge base recipes sync and update information from your connected applications to your knowledge base. The knowledge base recipe ensures that your genie's knowledge base has access to the latest data and stays aligned with your business requirements. Knowledge bases and knowledge base recipes can be assigned to multiple genies, including genies stored in different projects. Refer to [Create a genie manually](/en/agentic/agent-studio/create-a-genie) for complete steps on how to create a genie with a job description, AI model, chat interface, knowledge base, knowledge base recipe, and skills.

9. Click **Add knowledge base**. The recipe editor opens with the [Upsert documents](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/knowledge-base-connector/actions/upsert-documents) action from [Knowledge base by Workato](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/knowledge-base-connector/knowledge-base-connector) automatically selected.

   > **NEW RECIPES USE THE UPSERT DOCUMENTS ACTION**
   > 
   > New knowledge base recipes use the [Upsert documents](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/knowledge-base-connector/actions/upsert-documents) action. Recipes created earlier use the deprecated [Store knowledge](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/workato-genie-connector/actions/store-knowledge) action, which continues to run unchanged.
   
10. Configure your recipe.
    
11. Test your recipe to ensure workflow compatibility with your genie.
    
12. Click **Save**.
