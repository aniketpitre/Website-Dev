# Chat interface

The chat interface is the genie component visibly exposed to your end users. You can integrate the chat interface into platforms where your organization works, such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, Workato GO, and internal systems with custom chatbots. You can also add a custom chat interface with configurable authentication. The chat interface includes the following capabilities:

- A user-friendly interface for employees to interact with the genie
- Customizable UI elements to match your brand and user experience preferences
- Real-time communication between users and the genie

The interface you select determines where users can discover and interact with the genie, which features are available, and how conversations behave. Slack and Microsoft Teams chat interfaces include channel support. Workato GO provides a dedicated enterprise AI interface with search, Action Board, and KPI dashboards.

> **USING AN EXTERNAL AI CLIENT?**
> 
> You can expose the genie as an MCP server if your users work in an external AI client, such as Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, or a custom-built UI. The external AI client becomes the interface with users interacting with their AI client as normal. The AI client calls the genie's capabilities through the MCP server when needed. See [MCP server configuration](/en/mcp/genies-as-mcp-clients) for more information.

## Direct message support

Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Workato GO support direct messaging (DMs). Genies respond to every message in DMs. DMs behave the same regardless of the [channel mode](/en/agentic/agent-studio/chat-interface/channel-support#channel-modes) you select.

## Channel support

Genies support participation in Slack and Microsoft Teams channels in addition to DMs. This enables use cases for IT help desks, HR support, and project assistance channels. Workato GO doesn't provide channel support. Refer to [Channel support options](/en/agentic/agent-studio/chat-interface/channel-support#channel-support-options) for more information.

## Chat intermediate updates

You can disable chat intermediate updates, such as intermediate messages and tool calls. These processes continue to run, but are invisible to end-users chatting with the genie when disabled.

### Intermediate messages

Intermediate messages are automatically enabled on all supported chat interfaces.

Each genie sends intermediate messages with real-time status updates and partial findings as it works through a task before it returns the final response. For example, if a user asks your genie to summarize the knowledge base, the genie first sends an intermediate message, such as `I'll search the knowledge base and provide you with a summary` before returning the final two-sentence summary.

#### Disable intermediate messages

You can disable intermediate messages for genies at the project level.

Complete the following steps to disable genie intermediate messages within a project:

1. Go to **Projects** and select the project where you plan to disable intermediate messages.
   
2. Click the **Settings** tab.
   
3. Select **Project properties** and click **\+ Add new property**.
   
4. Go to the **Property name** field and enter `intermediate_messages_disabled`.
   
5. Go to the **Value** field and enter `true`.
   
6. Click the checkmark to save your changes.
   

### Intermediate tool calls

Intermediate tools calls are automatically enabled on all supported chat interfaces.

Each genie displays intermediate tool calls in real-time as it works through a task before it returns the final response or confirmation.

#### Disable intermediate tool calls

You can disable intermediate tool calls for genies at the project level.

Complete the following steps to disable genie intermediate tool calls within a project:

1. Go to **Projects** and select the project where you plan to disable intermediate tool calls.
   
2. Click the **Settings** tab.
   
3. Select **Project properties** and click **\+ Add new property**.
   
4. Go to the **Property name** field and enter `tool_call_streams_disabled`.
