# Headless API

The [custom chat interface](/en/agentic/agent-studio/chat-interface/chat-interface#configure-a-custom-chat-interface) lets you connect your genie to any application you build and control. Your application talks to your genie directly over a REST API, called a Headless API, instead of routing users through Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Workato GO.

> **HEADLESS API ENDPOINTS REQUIRE A CUSTOM CHAT INTERFACE**
> 
> Headless API endpoints are only compatible with the [custom chat interface](/en/agentic/agent-studio/chat-interface/chat-interface#configure-a-custom-chat-interface) option.

The custom chat interface includes API endpoints to manage conversations and send and receive genie messages. This API is separate from the [Agent Studio Developer API](/en/workato-api/agent-studio#agent-studio), which lets you create, configure, and maintain genies.

## Headless API prerequisites

Confirm you have the following requirements to use Headless API:

- You have a genie in Agent Studio.
- You've set up the genie's [custom chat interface](/en/agentic/agent-studio/chat-interface/chat-interface#configure-a-custom-chat-interface) from the Agent Studio UI, including creating and attaching a genie client with either API key or OAuth 2.0 (PKCE) credentials. Refer to [Genie clients](/en/workato-api/agent-studio#genie-clients) in the Developer API if you provision the client programmatically instead of through the UI.
- Your builder role has the **Custom chat interface** privilege under **Genie building**. Refer to [collaborator privileges](/en/privileges#custom-chat-interface) for more information on configuring builder roles.

## Headless API base URLs

Headless API is available in all data centers where Agentic is supported. The base URLs follow the same per-data-center scheme as the app host. For example:

| Data center | Dev API base URL | Headless API base URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| US | `https://app.workato.com` | `https://genie-api.workato.com` |

Refer to the [data center overview](/en/datacenter/datacenter-overview) for more information.

## Authentication

Headless API supports the following access methods:

**API key:**

```http
Authorization: Bearer <api_key>
X-IDP-User-Id: <idp_user_id>
```

**OAuth 2.0 (PKCE):**

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

### Authorization methods comparison

Refer to the following authorization method comparison and use case recommendation tables to determine which authorization method to use:

| Comparison point | API key (token-based) | OAuth 2.0 (PKCE) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **How it works** | The builder's backend holds a static API key and asserts user identity through the `X-IDP-User-Id` header. | End users authenticate directly through Workato Identity and delegate to the customer's IdP through SAML SSO. |
| **End user visibility** | Workato is invisible to end users. | End users see an IdP login step. |
| **Required headers** | `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` and `X-IDP-User-Id: <idp_user_id>` | `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` |
| **Client credentials** | The API key is static and is shown only once. | `client_id` only — PKCE replaces the client secret. |
| **User identity managed by** | The builder maps user IDs to Workato IdP user IDs. | IdP directly, such as Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, OneLogin, and more. |
| **Prerequisites** | End users provisioned in Workato Identity through IAM API or the Workato UI. | One-time SAML federation between Workato Identity and the customer's existing IdP. Workato Identity acts as a broker. It doesn't replace the customer's IdP. |
| **Recommended for** | Server-side integrations, QA, automated testing, internal tools. | User-facing apps requiring SSO, centralized access governance, and per-user permissions. |

### Recommended authorization method by scenario

| Scenario | Recommended |
| --- | --- |
| QA / automated testing | API key |
| Security red-teaming through CI/CD | API key |
| Internal tool with builder-controlled authorization | API key |
| Custom chat UI where Workato should be invisible | API key |
| Employee portal with company SSO | OAuth 2.0 |
| Multi-tenant app serving multiple organizations | OAuth 2.0 |
| Deployment requiring IdP-governed access control | OAuth 2.0 |
| Mobile or single-page app or public client | OAuth 2.0 |

### OAuth 2.0 PKCE authorization flow

OAuth clients authenticate end users through Workato Identity (`id.workato.com`) using the authorization code flow with PKCE. No client secret is required. Use the `oauth_client_id` returned when you [create an OAuth genie client](/en/workato-api/agent-studio#create-a-genie-client).

You must complete the following steps to use this authorization flow:

1. Generate a `code_verifier` to create a random, URL-safe string of 43–128 characters and derive the `code_challenge` as `base64url(sha256(code_verifier))`.
   
2. Redirect the user to the authorization endpoint:
   
   ```plaintext
   https://id.workato.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code
     &client_id=<oauth_client_id>
     &redirect_uri=<your_redirect_url>
     &scope=openid profile email
     &state=<random_state>
     &code_challenge=<code_challenge>
     &code_challenge_method=S256
   ```
   
3. Verify `state` matches when Workato Identity redirects to your `redirect_uri` with a `code` and the original `state`.
   
4. Exchange the code for tokens at `https://id.workato.com/oauth/token` with a form-encoded body. Don't send the client secret:
   
   <api-code>

   ```
   curl -X POST https://id.workato.com/oauth/token \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
     -d "client_id=<oauth_client_id>" \
     -d "redirect_uri=<your_redirect_url>" \
     -d "code=<authorization_code>" \
     -d "code_verifier=<code_verifier>"
   ```

   </api-code>
   
5. Use the returned `access_token` as `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` on Headless API calls. The token response also includes a `refresh_token` and an `id_token`.
   
6. Refresh the access token before it expires (`expires_in` is `3600` seconds) to avoid forcing the user through an interactive login again. Exchange the `refresh_token` at `https://id.workato.com/oauth/token` to obtain a new access token silently:
   
   <api-code>

   ```
   curl -X POST https://id.workato.com/oauth/token \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "grant_type=refresh_token" \
     -d "client_id=<oauth_client_id>" \
     -d "refresh_token=<refresh_token>"
   ```

   </api-code>
   
   Refresh tokens are single-use and rotating: each refresh returns a new `refresh_token`. Persist the new value for the next refresh. Request the default `openid profile email` scope and don't add `offline_access`, which Workato Identity rejects.
   

The redirect URL must match the `oauth_redirect_url` registered on the client. Perform the code exchange in the preceding steps from a same-origin backend rather than directly in the browser. This ensures the flow is free of cross-origin (CORS) concerns and keeps token handling server-side.

### Base event shape

Every event shares the following base fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `conversation_id` | **string** | Conversation ID. |
| `genie_handle` | **string** | Genie handle (string identifier, for example `gin-AaDX9axF-CNtgQn-B6`). |
| `genie_run_id` | **string** | ID of the genie run this event belongs to. |
| `type` | **string** | Event type. |
| `event_id` | **string** | UUIDv7 identifying this event. |
| `seq_num` | **integer** | Per-genie-run monotonic sequence number. |
| `created_at` | **string** | Gateway-side timestamp when the event was persisted, in RFC3339 format. |

### Event types

| Event | Additional fields | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `processing` `.started` |  | Genie has begun processing the request. |
| `processing` `.finished` | `reason` | Genie has completed processing. The `reason` field indicates why the run ended. Refer to [Processing finished reasons](#processing-finished-reasons). |
| `agent` `.message` | `message` | The genie's response message. |
| `skill` `.running` | `skill_name`, `skill_id`, `call_id`, `skill_parameters`, `skill_` `parameter_schema`, `requires_user_` `confirmation` | A skill has started executing. When the genie runs skills in parallel, each skill emits its own `skill.running` event. Match events to skills by `call_id`. |
| `skill` `.completed` | `skill_name`, `skill_id`, `call_id`, `skill_result`, `skill_result_schema`, `requires_user_` `confirmation`, `job_id` | A skill completed successfully. Match to the corresponding `skill.running` event by `call_id`. `job_id` is absent for MCP skills. |
| `skill` `.failed` | `skill_name`, `skill_id`, `error`, `job_id` | A skill execution failed. |
| `skill` `.stopped` | `skill_name`, `skill_id` | Terminal variant emitted by some runtime versions in place of `skill.completed`. Treat it as a successful completion. |
| `skill` `.confirmation` `_required` | `call_id`, `skill_name`, `skill_id`, `skill_parameters`, `skill_` `parameter_schema` | A skill requires user confirmation before executing. Use `call_id` with [Approve or reject a skill](#approve-or-reject-a-skill). |
| `runtime_connection` `.auth_required` | `runtime_connection` `_attempt_id`, `auth_link` | A skill requires the user to authenticate a connection. Use `runtime_connection` `_attempt_id` with [Get a runtime connection link](#get-a-runtime-connection-link). |
| `runtime_connection` `.auth_success` | `runtime_connection` `_attempt_id` | The user completed authentication and the connection is established. The skill resumes. |
| `runtime_connection` `.auth_failed` | `runtime_connection` `_attempt_id`, `reason` | The runtime connection authorization didn't complete. `reason` explains why, for example `rejected_by_user`. |
| `system.ping` |  | Keep-alive heartbeat, sent roughly every 30 seconds during long-running or paused turns. Ignore it. |
| `system` `.stream_interrupted` | `genie_run_id`, `last_seq_num`, `reason`, `retry_after_ms` | The server closed the stream before the turn finished (for example, during a long pause). Recover from persisted state rather than assuming the turn failed; see [Rebuild a conversation timeline](/en/agentic/agent-studio/chat-interface/headless-api-troubleshooting#rebuild-a-conversation-timeline). |

### Processing finished reasons

The `processing.finished` event includes a `reason` field:

| Reason | Description | Client action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `internal_error` | The genie run ended because of an internal error. | Show an error state. You can send the message again. |
| `business_approval_pending` | The genie is waiting on a business approval. The stream closes. A new genie run starts after the approval is decided. | Don't reconnect to the stream. Listen for the new run's events after the approval is resolved. |

### Runtime connection flow

The stream runs the following sequence when a skill requires a connection the user hasn't authorized:

- The genie emits `runtime_connection.auth_required` with a `runtime_connection_attempt_id`.
- Calls [Get a runtime connection link](#get-a-runtime-connection-link) and shows `auth_link.url` to the user. No user action is needed if the `status` is `authorized`.
- Authentication flow either:
  - The user authenticates, and the genie emits `runtime_connection.auth_success`. The skill resumes.
  - The user declines, and [Reject a runtime connection](#reject-a-runtime-connection) is called. The genie emits `runtime_connection.auth_failed` with `reason` set to `rejected_by_user`.

## Limitations

Headless API endpoints have the following limitations:

- [Action Board](/en/agentic/agent-studio/action-board) isn't supported
- [App Events](/en/agentic/agent-studio/app-events) aren't supported
- A genie supports a single attached client. The client-to-genie relationship is **1:1**: attaching a second client returns a `409` conflict. [Detach](/en/workato-api/agent-studio#detach-a-client-from-a-genie) the existing client first to re-point it.

## Quotas

| Description | Quota | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rate quota for unauthenticated Headless API requests | 200 requests per second globally | 50 requests per second per genie and 50 requests per second per source IP also apply. |
| Rate quota for authenticated Headless API requests | 50 requests per second globally | 20 requests per second per workspace apply to all endpoints except **Send a message**. 5 requests per second per workspace apply to the **Send a message** endpoint. |
| Concurrent server-sent event (SSE) streams for authenticated Headless API requests | 1,000 concurrent streams globally | 100 concurrent SSE streams per workspace also apply. |
