> Learn how skills define workflows that AI agents invoke, letting genies and MCP servers take action and respond to end users in Workato.

# Skills

You can create skills to define workflows that AI agents can invoke. Genies invoke skills directly, and MCP servers expose skills as tools that external AI clients call through the Model Context Protocol. Skills equip these agents with a comprehensive toolset to take action and respond to end users. You can assign skills to multiple genies and MCP servers, including those stored in different projects.

Every skill has two parts that work together:

- **Skill**: A workflow with a **Start workflow** trigger and a **Return response** step. The skill contains the logic, API calls, data transformations, and error handling. The skill is what executes when the agent decides to invoke it.
  
- **Skill prompt**: The description configured in the genie's **Skills** tab or the MCP server's **Tools** tab. The agent reads this prompt to decide whether to invoke the skill for a request. It contains the purpose, the **When to Use** and **When NOT to Use** conditions, input requirements, and the output requirements.
  

Skills without a well-written prompt are invoked inconsistently. A well-written prompt paired with a badly constructed skill invokes correctly but fails to execute.

Skills can accept document files through the **File** input parameter type. This passes file data to the recipe as a datapill.

There are three methods to add skills to a genie:

- **Build a new custom skill**: Create a skill from scratch in the editor. This is the path for integrations with a Workato-connected app, a custom API, or a [Data table](/en/data-tables).
  
- **Add an existing skill**: Use a skill that was created and assigned to another genie. This is the path for reusing skills across multiple genies.
  
- **Add an MCP server as a skill source**: Connect an external MCP server to a common provider server, such as Atlassian or Salesforce, or a custom MCP server, and select individual tools as skills. This is the path for accessing external APIs without building custom skill logic.
  

Refer to [Create a skill with a File input parameter](/en/agentic/agent-studio/upload-files-and-images#create-a-skill-recipe-with-a-file-input-parameter) for more information.

Skills use [Verified user access](/en/agentic/agent-studio/verified-user-access) to allow each end user to authenticate with their own credentials when a skill runs. This ensures that the skill performs actions using the individual user's identity and permissions.

Your end users have the ability to manage their runtime user connection through the genie chat interface.

Skills can consume [MCP servers](/en/mcp). This enables you to access external APIs and integrate with third-party tools without custom skill development. Skills can call [Custom MCP servers](/en/agentic/agent-studio/create-a-genie#add-skills-from-a-custom-mcp-server) and [common provider MCP servers](/en/agentic/agent-studio/create-a-genie#add-skills-from-a-common-provider-mcp-server).

You can [share your skills in the Community Library](/en/community-library#community-library).

6. Click **Start building**. The genie **Build** page displays.
   
   > **JOB DESCRIPTIONS ARE AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED**
   > 
   > The **Job description** is automatically generated based on the input you provide to the **What would you like your genie to help with?** field during genie setup and can be edited to suit your requirements.

    Alternatively, you can create a skill from the **Projects** page by clicking **Create > Skill** or pressing C+S.
    
11. Provide a name for your skill in the **Skill name** field.
    
12. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select a location for your skill.
    
13. Click **Start building**. The editor opens with the **Start workflow** trigger and **Return response** action automatically selected.
    

You've created a new skill for your genie. Refer to [Create a new skill](/en/agentic/agent-studio/create-a-genie#create-a-new-skill) for steps on how to configure your skill.
