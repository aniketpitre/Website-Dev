# Test cases overview

Test cases are available at the recipe level. To view the list of test cases, choose a recipe and navigate to the **Test cases** interface. This interface displays a table containing all test cases created for this recipe.

## What is a test case?

A test case is a set of mock data and checks for specific steps of a particular recipe.

You can create multiple test cases for any recipe you plan to test.

A test case defines:

- What steps should use mock (simulated) data and the mock data that should be used.
- What step output data must be checked and the expected result of the check.

For each test case, you can add a unique name and provide a description of the purpose of the test case.
