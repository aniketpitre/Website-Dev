# View test case run results

When Workato finishes running a test job, you receive a notification with the test case run results.

The test case run results modal contains the following information about each test case that was executed.

- Recipe name
- Test case name
- Test case run result (passed/failed)
- Check that failed (if any)
- Link to a job for a test case run

## If the test case has no checks

The job run result is the same as the test case run result.

## Test case run jobs

In addition to viewing test case run results after a test case run completes, you can access all test case run results at the recipe level on the **Jobs** page.
