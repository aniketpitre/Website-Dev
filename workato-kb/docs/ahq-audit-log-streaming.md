> Set up audit log streaming in Automation HQ to send logs from all current and future managed workspaces to a single external log provider.

# Audit log streaming for Automation HQ

Enable an audit log streaming system for your entire organization. This includes all current and future workspaces that Automation HQ manages.

> **INFO**
> 
> You can't modify log settings within managed workspaces.

Automation HQ adapts [Audit log streaming](/en/features/activity-audit-log-streaming#audit-log-streaming) to provide a single logging mechanism and destination for all workspaces in your organization.

   _Choose audit log streaming destination_
   
5. Use the following tabs to complete the steps for your selected destination:
   
   **Amazon S3 bucket**
   
   Complete the following steps to configure Amazon S3 as your audit log destination:
   
   1. [Create a new connection](/en/connectors/s3#connection-setup) for Amazon S3, or use an existing connection.
      
      _Configure Amazon S3 as your audit log destination_
      
   2. Use the **Choose a bucket** drop-down menu to select a bucket from your Amazon S3 instance.
      
   3. Select the events to stream:
      
      - **Job status only**: Logs whether a job succeeded or failed.
      - **Full job details**: Logs job details, including status and data for each line action.
      - **User activity**: Logs all user activity in the workspace.
      - **API platform logs**: Logs all API requests handled by the API platform.
      - **Workato Log events**: Logs all messages sent to the Workato logging service.
      - **Genie conversations**: Logs the full details of genie conversations, including data for every response.
      
      Additionally, select the **Log types** and **Log levels** to include if you plan to stream events from the [Workato logging service](/en/features/logging-service).
      
   4. Optional. Use the **Customize log message** field to define log messages using JSON format. You can add custom fields and structures. For more details, refer to the [Customize log message](/en/features/activity-audit-log-streaming-customize-log) documentation.
      
   5. Click **Save** to enable streaming to the Amazon S3 bucket.
      
   
   **Azure Monitor**

Migrate to client credentials authentication instead.
      
   3. Select an existing connection or refer to the [Azure Monitor](/en/connectors/azure_monitor) guide to create a new connection. Save the **Immutable ID** and the **Data source** name (stream name) from the [Create a data collection rule and assign permissions](/en/connectors/azure_monitor#register-app-client-creds) step for later use if your authentication type is **Client credentials**.
