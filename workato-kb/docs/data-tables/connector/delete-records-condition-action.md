# Delete records by condition action (batch)

The **Delete records by condition** batch action deletes records that match the filter conditions you specify in a data table. Each run deletes up to 200 records.

The action deletes the first 200 records when more than 200 records match your filters. The remaining matching records stay in the table, and the job still completes successfully. Run the action again with the same filters to delete them. Repeat until **Deleted records count** is less than `200`.
