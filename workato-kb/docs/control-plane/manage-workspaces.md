> Use Control plane to link multiple workspaces.

# Link workspaces

You must link workspaces to your Control plane to enable centralized identity governance. A workspace provides a single location for projects, Workato [tools](/en/tools), such as data orchestration, event streams, and API platform, and other platform features, such as agents and MCP servers.

> **CONTROL PLANE ISN'T A WORKSPACE**
> 
> Control plane isn't a workspace. Control plane doesn't provide the configuration or tools for teams to collaborate, build recipes, and deploy recipes for a department, level of business, or organization unit.
