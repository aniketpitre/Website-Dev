> Manage AI registry access and assets, including agents, MCP servers, and AI model routes within your Control plane.

# AI registry

AI registry provides a central place to discover, govern, and share the AI assets built across your organization.

AI registry includes the following asset types from workspaces linked to your Control plane:

- **[Agents](/en/agentic/agent-studio/genies-configuration)**: AI agents built in Agent Studio.
- **[MCP servers](/en/mcp/mcp-servers)**: MCP servers that expose tools to MCP-compatible clients and agents.
- **AI model [routes](/en/ai-gateway/routes#create-a-route)**: Model Gateway routes that direct requests to AI models.

AI registry is organized into two areas:

- **[Asset catalog](#asset-catalog)**: Browse and filter assets by workspace, environment, and visibility. You can publish or unpublish assets through the registry to manage visibility.
- **[Registry access](#registry-access)**: Control how users and AI clients consume published assets. The **User portal** provides a web portal where users can find available assets. The **Registry MCP** provides an MCP endpoint that MCP-compatible clients and agents can connect to.

## Asset catalog

The Asset catalog provides AI assets, including [agents](/en/agentic/agent-studio/genies-configuration), [MCP servers](/en/mcp/mcp-servers), and AI model [routes](/en/ai-gateway/routes#create-a-route) for all workspaces linked to the Control plane.

The Asset catalog provides options to filter by workspace, environment, and visibility.
