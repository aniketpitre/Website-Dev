# Project roles

Project roles control what a user or group can access and manage inside a specific project. You can assign these roles per project to define responsibilities across build, deploy, and review tasks. The following table lists system project roles and the access they provide:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Project admin | Grants full access to all project content and settings, including user management and deletion. |
| Advanced builder | Grants full access to build and deploy, without access to manage settings or user permissions. |
| Builder | Allows users to modify folders, recipes, Workato apps, and data tables. This role also allows test automation but not deployment. |
| Project operator | Grants read-only access to project content and the ability to run and stop recipes. |

Use the following guides to review the full set of privileges for each role:

- [Project admin](#project-admin)
- [Advanced builder](#advanced-builder)
- [Builder](#builder)
- [Project operator](#project-operator)
