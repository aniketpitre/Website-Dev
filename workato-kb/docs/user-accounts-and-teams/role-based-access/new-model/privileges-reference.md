> Reference for Workato environment-level and project-level privileges, covering what each controls and its dependencies for custom roles.

# Privileges

This page lists all available privileges in Workato. Use this reference when creating or editing custom roles. Each entry describes what the privilege controls, where it applies, and any dependencies to consider.

Privileges fall into two scopes:

- [Environment-level privileges](#environment-privileges): Apply across the entire environment
- [Project-level privileges](#project-privileges): Apply within a specific project

## Environment privileges

Environment-level privileges control access across entire environments. They cover administrative tools, configuration options, and features shared across multiple projects, such as lifecycle settings, OAuth profiles, or project creation.

Workspaces may include multiple environments, and collaborators can have different environment roles across each one.

### Platform tools

The **Platform tools** privileges tab controls access to shared tools and features that operate across projects within the environment. This tab includes the following privilege access:

- [Project management](#project-management)
- [Tools](#tools)
- [On-premise](#on-premise)
- [Apps portal](#apps-portal)
- [Data storage](#data-storage)
- [API platform](#api-platform)
- [Connector SDK](#connector-sdk)
- [Insights](#insights)

#### Project management

The following privileges control whether a collaborator can create projects and manage access to all projects in the environment. When a user creates a project, Workato automatically assigns them the [Project admin](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/system-project-roles#project-admin) role for that project.

> **SKILL ACCESS FOR GENIES AND MCP**
> 
> Users with either the **Workato Genies** privilege or the **MCP servers** privilege can view and manage [skills](/en/agentic/skills) built with the [Workato Skill connector](/en/agentic/agent-studio/connectors/workato-skill-connector/workato-skill-connector). This lets builders on Business MCP and Enterprise MCP plans create and manage skills without an Agent Studio license.

> **PERMISSION MIGRATION**
> 
> Access control for event streams is transitioning to the project level because event streams are now assets. Workato migrates existing access automatically by creating new user groups and project roles named **Topics manager**, **Topics editor**, and **Topics viewer**, which provide collaborators equivalent project-level permissions to their pre-migration access. Workato skips environment roles without any collaborators, and environment roles with the same access level share one project role.
> 
> You can access event stream access through either [project-level](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/privileges-reference#project-assets) or [environment-level](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/privileges-reference#tools) privileges during the [transition period](/en/event-streams#event-streams-as-project-assets). You must use the project-level privilege after the transition period.
