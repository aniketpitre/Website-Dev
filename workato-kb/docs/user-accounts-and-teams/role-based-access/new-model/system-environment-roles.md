> Reference for Workato environment roles, including Environment admin, Environment manager, and Member, and the privileges each role grants.

# Environment roles

Environment roles define a collaborator's permissions within a specific environment. These roles control access to platform tools, environment settings, and administrative functions, but don't grant access to project content.

You can assign different environment roles to the same collaborator in different environments. For example, a DevOps engineer can have **Environment admin** in Development, **Member** in Testing, and **No access** in Production.

> **PROJECT ACCESS**
> 
> Environment roles don't include project access. Assign a project role to allow collaborators to view, edit, or manage project content.

Workato provides the following default environment roles:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Environment admin | Full control over workspace-wide and environment settings. |
| Environment manager | Full control over environment settings, but no workspace-wide permissions. |
| Member | View-only access to environment settings. |

Use the following guides to review the full set of privileges for each role:

- [Environment admin](#environment-admin)
- [Environment manager](#environment-manager)
- [Member](#member)

## Environment admin

The **Environment admin** role grants full administrative access within a specific environment. Assign this role to collaborators who manage projects, configure platform features, and control access within the environment.

Environment admins can perform the following actions in their assigned environment:

- [Create and manage](#project-management) projects in the environment
- [Manage project membership](#project-management), including adding or removing collaborators and assigning project roles
- [Configure tools](#tools) like Workbot, Logs, and Message templates
- Manage shared features such as data storage, the API platform, Apps portal, and Insights
- [Assign environment roles](#workspace-access) to other users

Environment admins can't access or edit the contents of a project, such as recipes or assets, unless also assigned a [project role](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/system-project-roles) that explicitly grants those permissions.

The following tables list the full set of privileges included in the **Environment admin** role. Each section describes the tools or features the privileges control.

### Platform tools privileges

The following privileges control environment-level tools and features shared across multiple projects. They include configuration access for core tools, project management, and on-prem systems.

#### Project management

These privileges control whether a collaborator can create projects and manage access to all projects in the environment. When a user creates a project, Workato automatically assigns them the [Project admin](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/system-project-roles#project-admin) role for that project.

## Environment manager

The **Environment manager** role provides administrative control over environment-level settings and platform tools, but excludes workspace-wide privileges and project-level access. Assign this role to collaborators who maintain environment configurations and create new projects, without needing full administrative control.

Environment managers can perform the following actions in their assigned environment:

- [Create new projects](#project-management) in the environment
- [Configure platform tools](#tools) such as Workbot and OAuth profiles
- Manage shared features such as data storage, the API platform, Apps portal, and Insights

Environment managers can't configure workspace settings or manage users across environments. They also can't access or edit project content, such as recipes or assets, unless also assigned a [project role](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/system-project-roles) that explicitly grants those permissions.

The following tables list the full set of privileges included in the **Environment manager** role. Each section describes the tools or features the privileges control.
