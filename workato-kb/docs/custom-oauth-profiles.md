> Use custom OAuth profiles to connect Workato with your own OAuth apps for greater control over scopes, security, branding, and authentication.

# Custom OAuth profiles

[Custom OAuth profiles](https://app.workato.com/custom_oauth_keys) let you use your own OAuth applications when connecting Workato to third-party services. This gives you greater control over scopes, security, branding, and how authentication is managed.

You can create a custom OAuth profile by going to **Tools > Custom OAuth profiles** and clicking **\+ New custom profile**. This process typically involves creating the OAuth app in the vendor's developer console and entering the client ID and secret in Workato.

> **FEATURE AVAILABILITY**
> 
> The Custom OAuth profiles feature is included in specific pricing plans. Refer to your pricing plan and contract to learn more.
> 
> Additionally, Customers using the China data center must configure [Custom OAuth profiles](/en/custom-oauth-profiles) before establishing connections to connectors that support OAuth 2.0 authentication. Custom OAuth profile configuration can require the following customer-provided credentials:
> 
> - Client IDs
> - Client secrets
> - OAuth 2.0 endpoint URLs

## Key benefits

Custom OAuth profiles provide the following key benefits:

- **Granular scope control**: Request only the permissions (scopes) your integration needs, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
- **Enhanced security and compliance**: Manage your own OAuth app, including client secret rotation, auditing, and alignment with your organization's policies.
- **Custom branding**: Display your organization's branding on OAuth consent screens.
- **Access isolation**: Deploy multiple custom apps to segment access for different teams, environments, or customers.
- **Vendor compliance**: Meet requirements from vendors that mandate using your own registered app.

Custom OAuth profiles also enable you to install multiple custom Workbots onto a single Slack workspace, each with distinct identities, permissions, and branding.
