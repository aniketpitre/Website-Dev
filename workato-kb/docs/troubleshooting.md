# Troubleshooting

Workato’s troubleshooting resources provide comprehensive guidance on addressing errors and unexpected recipe behaviors. It covers common issues such as design-time errors, run-time errors, timeouts, and connection issues. Additionally, it covers best practices for error handling, debugging tools like job debug tracing, and specific troubleshooting solutions for various apps.

## Common recipe errors

This section describes the key error types you can encounter in Workato, categorized into [design-time](/en/recipes/design-runtime-error#design-time-errors) errors and [run-time](/en/recipes/design-runtime-error#run-time-errors) errors. Each category includes common issues and troubleshooting guides.

Refer to our [Common recipe errors](/en/recipes/design-runtime-error) page for a detailed breakdown of specific scenarios and solutions.

## General error codes

Workato uses standard HTTP error codes to signal issues during recipe execution, typically when interacting with external systems. These codes appear in job reports and error handling datapills, and help you determine why a request failed.

Refer to the [General error codes](/en/troubleshooting/general-errors) section for explanations of frequent errors and what they mean in the context of your recipes.

## Best practices

We recommend following these best practices to ensure smooth recipe execution and improve troubleshooting efficiency:

- **Build and test incrementally**: Build recipes in small steps to simplify error detection and debugging. You can use the skip step feature to test specific parts of your recipe without running unconfigured or faulty steps. This method allows you to catch issues early and ensures your automations run correctly before going live. Learn more about [testing with skip steps](/en/troubleshooting/tips-and-tricks/test-frequently).
  
- **Error handling and monitoring**: Set up effective error-handling strategies to manage recipe failures and streamline troubleshooting. You can use error handling steps to monitor for action errors, validate input data with conditional actions, and send custom error notifications when issues occur. Learn more about [error handling and monitoring](/en/recipes/best-practices-error-handling).
  
- **Error notifications**: Automate email alerts for failed jobs to stay informed and address errors promptly. You can customize recipients and select which projects send notifications to prevent unnecessary alerts. Learn more about [error notifications](/en/recipes/error-notifications#error-notifications).
  
- **Security best practices**: Protect your data and recipes by following security best practices. Avoid placing sensitive data directly in recipe steps, use encrypted storage options, and manage user permissions to safeguard your automations. Learn more about [security best practices](/en/recipes/recipe-security).
  
- **Performance and memory optimization**: Handle large data by designing recipes that use batch processing and file streaming. These methods reduce memory usage and improve performance. Learn more about [memory optimization best practices](/en/recipes/memory-utilization).
  

## Solution articles

Solution articles offer targeted help for specific errors or issues in Workato. These guides enable you to troubleshoot common problems such as connection issues, HTTP errors, and method failures. [Explore](/en/troubleshooting/500-internal-server-error) the articles in this section for detailed troubleshooting on specific topics.

## Job debug tracing

Leverage job debug tracing to identify and resolve recipe errors by analyzing detailed HTTP requests and responses for each action. Debug provides visibility into headers, payloads, and responses to detect issues in integrations with external systems. Learn more about enabling and using [job debug tracing](/en/recipes/job-debug-tracing).
