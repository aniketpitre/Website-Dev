Recipes are automated workflows that connect your apps. Each recipe contains a trigger and one or more actions. When you start a recipe, it waits for a triggering event to run the actions.

The following steps guide you through building a recipe that closes a case in Salesforce whenever an issue with the same name is closed in Jira.

## Create a new recipe

Complete the following steps to create a new recipe:

1. Sign in to your Workato account.
   
2. Go to the **Projects** page.
