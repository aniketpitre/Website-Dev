> Build a recipe that connects OpenAI, GitHub, and Confluence to generate release notes pages from merged pull requests each week.

# Generate Confluence release notes from merged GitHub PRs recipe

This use case guides you through connecting [OpenAI](/en/connectors/openai), [GitHub](/en/connectors/github), and [Confluence](/en/connectors/confluence) to create a powerful automation.

## What does this recipe do?

This recipe retrieves merged pull requests (PRs) weekly from GitHub, iterates through each one to check for a specific Jira project key in the PR body, and, if found, sends the PR body to ChatGPT for a summary of the changes. Each summarized PR is then added to a new release notes page in Confluence.

       ![Fill out the Content field](/assets/content.CcFlf0rw.png)_Fill out the Content field_
       
       This initialization is necessary for a later step, as you can't append a string (the content generated from ChatGPT) to a `nil` variable.
       
    7. Click **Save**.
       
    
14. Click **\+ Add step** and select **Repeat for each**.
    
    ![Add repeat for each](/assets/repeat-for-each-standard.IXsKDXgV.png)_Click **Add step > Repeat for each**_
    
    How does the Repeat for each condition work?
    
    ### Repeat for each condition GitHub and Jira example
    
    A [Repeat for each](/en/recipes/repeat-for-each) loop _repeats_ one or more actions _for each_ item in a list. The loop ends automatically when the entire list is processed.
    
    ```mermaid
    flowchart TD
      A(["Start"]) --> B("Another merged GitHub pull request from the past week?")
      B -- "Yes" --> C("Check if PR body contains Jira project key") --> MoreSteps("Additional steps")
      B -- "No" --> D(["End loop"])
    classDef default fill:#67eadd,stroke:#b3e0e1,stroke-width:2px,color:#000;
    classDef WorkatoPink fill:#f3c1c2,stroke:#f3c1c2,stroke-width:1px;
    class A,D WorkatoPink
    ```
    
15. Set up your Repeat for each loop.
    
    ### Set up a Repeat for each loop for GitHub pull requests
    
    This step iterates through each of the pull requests that were merged in the past week.
    
    1. Map the GitHub Issues (Step 2) list datapill to the **Input list** field. This datapill contains a list of pull requests that match the search criteria specified in step 2.
       
    2. Use the **Repeat mode** drop-down menu to select **One item at a time**.
       
    3. Ensure **No** is selected in the **Clear step output** drop-down menu.
       
       ![Configure the Repeat for each loop](/assets/foreach-config.QMFrd1Q-.png)_Configure the Repeat for each loop_
       
    4. Click **Save**.
       
    
16. Click the **`…`** (ellipsis) next to the placeholder step in the recipe editor and select **Delete**.
    
    ![Delete placeholder](/assets/delete-placeholder.C2n16nJT.png)_Delete the placeholder step_
    
17. Click **\+ Add step** and select **IF condition**. Ensure this step is nested within the Repeat for each loop.
    
    ![Add IF condition](/assets/if-condition-standard.DI59XkdU.png)_Click **Add step > IF condition**_
    
    How do IF conditions work?
    
    ### Jira and GitHub IF condition example
    
    An [IF condition](/en/features/if-conditions) enables you to make decisions based on specific conditions. You can control your recipe workflow by executing different actions depending on whether a condition you specify is true or false.
    
    ```mermaid
    flowchart TD
        B(Does the PR body contain a specific Jira project key string?)
        B -->|Yes| C(Send message to OpenAI model with merged PR details)
        B ---->|No| E(No action required)

        classDef default fill:#67eadd,stroke:#b3e0e1,stroke-width:2px,color:#000;
        classDef WorkatoPink fill:#f3c1c2,stroke:#f3c1c2,stroke-width:1px;
        class E WorkatoPink
    ```
    
18. Set up your IF condition for GitHub and Jira.
    
    ### Set up an IF condition for GitHub and Jira
    
    This step verifies if the GitHub pull request includes a specific Jira project key in the title or body. This ensures that only relevant pull requests linked to the designated Jira project are included in the release notes.
    
    1. Map the Foreach Body (Step 4) datapill to **Data field**. Alternatively, you can use the Title (Step 4) datapill.
       
    2. Use the **Condition** drop-down menu to select **contains**.
       
    3. Enter the relevant Jira project key in the **Value** field. For example, to only include merged PRs with the Jira project key `CT` in release notes, enter `CT-` in this field.
       
       ![Configure the IF condition](/assets/if-condition.BktlAuh6.png)_Configure the IF condition_
       
    4. Click **Save**.
       
    
19. Click **Select an app and action**.
    
20. Set up your OpenAI Send messages to OpenAI models action.
    
    ### Set up OpenAI Send messages to OpenAI models action
    
    This step sends a message to ChatGPT and asks it to generate a description of the merged pull request based on the PR body.
    
    1. Search for `OpenAI` and select it as your app.
       
       ![Choose OpenAI](/assets/choose.D7kzBUIa.png)_Choose OpenAI_
       
    2. Select the **Send messages to OpenAI models** action.
       
       ![Select the Send messages to OpenAI models action](/assets/send-messages-openai.COkauuJg.png)_Select the Send messages to OpenAI models action_
       
    3. Select the OpenAI connection you created in the preceding steps.
       
    4. Use the **Message type** drop-down menu to select **Single message**.
       
    5. Enter the following prompt in the **Text to send** field:
       
       > Generate a clear, user-friendly description of the update using the details provided in the pull request description. Format each change as a standalone release note item without additional headings or introductory text. Keep it concise and use plain language.
       > 
       > Description:
       
    6. Append the Foreach Body (Step 4) datapill to the end of the message in the **Text to send** field.
       
       ![Map the Body datapill](/assets/text-to-send.TeQh4asL.png)_Map the Body (Step 4) datapill_
       
    7. Optional. Use the **Model** drop-down menu to select the GPT model to use. For example, select **gpt-4o-mini**. Defaults to **gpt-3.5-turbo** if left blank.
       
    8. Click **Save**.
       
    
21. Click **\+ Add step** and select **Action in app**. Ensure this step is nested within the IF condition.
    
22. Set up your Variables by Workato Update variables action.
    
    ### Set up Variables by Workato Update variables action
    
    This step appends the ChatGPT response to the `Content` variable. The step links each merged PR title to the corresponding GitHub pull request and adds bullet points that summarize the changes described in the PR body.
    
    1. Search for `Variables by Workato` and select it as your app.
       
       ![Choose Variables by Workato](/assets/choose.DetQOqPQ.png)_Choose Variables by Workato_
       
    2. Select the **Update variables** action.

    3. Use the **Variable name** drop-down menu to select **Content (step 3)**.
       
    4. Switch the **Content** field to [formula mode](/en/formulas/formula-mode) and perform the following actions:
       
       1. Map the Variables by Workato Content (Step 3) datapill.
          
       2. Enter `+ "\n" + "<a href='" +` to place the link on a new line.
          
       3. Map the Foreach Html URL (Step 4) datapill.
          
       4. Enter `+ "'>" +`.
          
       5. Map the Foreach Title (Step 4) datapill.
          
       6. Enter `+ "</a>" + "\n" +` to add the closing link tag and begin a new line.
          
       7. Map the OpenAI Best choice (Step 6) datapill.
          
       8. Enter `+ "\n"` to create a new line for details about the next merged PR.
          
          ![Update the Content variable](/assets/update-variable-content.DW96k3Ll.png)_Update the Content variable_
          
    5. Click **Save**.
       
    
23. Click **\+ Add step** and select **Action in app**. Ensure this step is placed outside of the IF condition and Repeat for each loop.
    
24. Set up your Confluence Create page action.
    
    ### Set up Confluence Create page action
    
    This step creates the Confluence page with the release notes.
    
    1. Search for `Confluence` and select it as your app.
       
       ![Choose Confluence](/assets/choose.BcDbzAxu.png)_Choose Confluence_
       
    2. Select the **Create page** action.
       
       ![Select the Create page action](/assets/create-page.D7F6BwNa.png)_Select the Create page action_
       
    3. Select the Confluence connection you created in the preceding steps.
       
    4. Enter the space key in the **Space key** field. This tells Confluence in which space the page should be created.
       
    5. Switch the **Title** field to [formula mode](/en/formulas/formula-mode) and enter the following:
       
       ```ruby
       "Release Notes for: " + today.to_s
       ```
       
       This formula creates the title for the Confluence page in the following format: `Release Notes for: YYYY-MM-DD`.
       
    6. Map the Variables by Workato Content (Step 3) datapill to the **Body** field.
