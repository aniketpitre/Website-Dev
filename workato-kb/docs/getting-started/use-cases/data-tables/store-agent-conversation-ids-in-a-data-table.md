> Use a Workato data table to store genie conversation IDs so your genie remembers previous messages from each user.

# Build a data table to store genie conversation IDs

This use case shows how to use a [data table](/en/data-tables) as persistent memory for a genie. Each task assigned to a genie starts a new conversation by default. Your genie needs a way to match each user to their existing genie conversation and retain context when it receives messages from multiple users through an interface, such as Telegram.

This use case demonstrates how a data table stores a mapping between each Telegram user ID and the genie's conversation ID. The recipe looks up the sender in the data table before each task and, if a record exists, continues the same conversation. The recipe upserts the conversation ID back into the table after each task.

You can add skills that use this conversation memory to your genies to carry out tasks that span multiple messages, such as scheduling a calendar event from a conversation about an upcoming appointment.

## What does this genie do?

This genie receives Telegram messages through a Workato recipe and uses a data table to store conversation IDs to match users to conversations and retain context.

## Why use a data table for conversation IDs?

Data tables are a good fit for this scenario for the following reasons:

- **Persistence across recipe jobs**: Each recipe job runs independently. A data table retains the conversation ID after the job ends, so the next message from the same user can pick up where the last message left off.
- **Fast lookups by key**: The recipe searches the table by a single `telegram-id` column.
- **No external database to maintain**: Data tables are scalable and secure, so you don't need to provision or manage separate storage.
- **Easy to inspect and edit**: You can open the table in the **Data tables** interface to view stored conversation IDs or delete a record to reset a user's conversation.

> **DATA TABLE LIMITATIONS**
> 
> Data tables aren't designed to store sensitive PCI data, such as credit card numbers, or to function as large relational databases. This use case stores only user IDs and conversation IDs. Don't use data tables to store the contents of sensitive conversations.

## Build your genie with a conversation ID data table

Complete the following steps to create a Telegram-based genie that uses a data table to maintain conversation context for each user:

> **USE CASES ARE INTENDED AS EXAMPLES ONLY**
> 
> Use cases are intended to serve as examples. Modifications, such as triggers, actions, data table columns, or connection permissions may require adjustments for your specific setup.

1. Sign in to Workato.
   
2. Create a data table to store conversation IDs.
   
   ### Create a data table to store conversation IDs
   
   This step creates a data table that persists the genie's conversation ID against each Telegram user's ID. This allows the genie to retain context across multiple messages from the same user.
   
   > **FIRST-TIME USERS**
   > 
   > The first time a user messages your Telegram bot, the **Search records** action doesn't return records because the user doesn't have a conversation ID yet. Leave the genie's conversation ID empty so the genie starts a new conversation. The upsert step in the next section saves the new conversation ID for future messages.
   
   1. Go to the project where you plan to store your data table and click **Create > Data table** or press C+T.
      
   2. Enter a name for your data table in the **Data table name** field. For example: `Telegram genie conversations`.

   11. Click **Save**.
       
   
7. Look up the sender's conversation ID in the data table.
   
   ### Look up the sender's conversation ID in the data table
   
   This step adds a Workato Data tables **Search records** action that checks whether the sender's Telegram ID has a corresponding conversation ID in the data table. An existing conversation ID indicates a previous conversation that the genie can continue.
   
   > **FIRST-TIME USERS**
   > 
   > The first time a user messages your Telegram bot, the **Search records** action doesn't return records because the user doesn't have a conversation ID yet. Leave the genie's conversation ID empty so the genie starts a new conversation. The upsert step in the next section saves the new conversation ID for future messages.
   
   1. Return to the recipe editor and click **\+ Add step** _before_ the **Assign task to genie** action step.
      
   2. Select **Action in app**, search for `Workato Data Tables`, and select it as your app.
      
   3. Select the **Search records** action.
      
   4. Use the **Data table** drop-down menu to select the data table you created in the preceding steps.
      
   5. Go to the **Filter** section and click **Add filter**.
      
   6. Use the **Column name** drop-down menu to select **telegram-id**.
      
   7. Use the **Operand** drop-down menu to select **equals**.
      
   8. Map the Telegram ID (Step 1) datapill to the **Value** field. This datapill is located under **Telegram > Message > From**.
      
      ![Configure the data table to search Telegram](/assets/telegram-data-table-configuration.BvJOfw8t.gif)_Configure the data table to search Telegram_
      
   9. Click **Save**.
      
   
8. Pass the stored conversation ID to the genie.
   
   ### Pass the stored conversation ID to the genie
   
   This step maps the conversation ID returned by the data table search to the **Assign task to genie** action. This is what allows the genie to continue an existing conversation instead of starting a new one.
   
   1. Click the **Assign task to genie** step in the recipe editor.
      
   2. Go to the **Conversation ID** field.
      
   3. Map the Workato Data tables genie-conversation-id (Step 2) datapill from the **Search records** step to the **Conversation ID** field. Use the first record in the search results.
      
   4. Click **Save**.
      
   
9. Save the conversation ID to the data table.
   
   ### Save the conversation ID to the data table
   
   This step adds a Workato Data tables **Upsert record** action that saves the conversation ID returned by the genie. The action creates a record for new users and updates the record for returning users.
   
   1. Click **\+ Add step** _after_ the **Assign task to genie** action step.
      
   2. Select **Action in app**, search for `Workato Data Tables`, and select it as your app.
      
   3. Select the **Upsert record** action.
      
   4. Use the **Data table** drop-down menu to select the data table you created in the preceding steps.
      
      ![Configure the Upsert record action](/assets/upsert-record-action.B59Jf31_.gif)_Configure the **Upsert record** action_
      
   5. Use the **Primary key** drop-down menu to select **telegram-id**.
      
   6. Go to the **Record fields** section and map the Telegram From ID (Step 1) datapill to the **telegram-id** field.
      
   7. Map the Workato Genie Conversation ID (Step 3) datapill to the **genie-conversation-id** field.
      
   8. Click **Save**.
      
   
10. Test your genie's memory.
    
    ### Test your genie's memory
    
    This step confirms that the data table is storing conversation IDs and that the genie uses them.
    
    1. Click **Test recipe** and send a message to your Telegram bot. For example: `My dentist appointment is next Tuesday.`
       
    2. Open your data table and confirm that a new record exists with your Telegram ID and a genie conversation ID.
       
    3. Send a follow-up message that depends on the first one. For example: `Actually, make that 4 PM.` The genie should respond with the earlier appointment in mind.
       
    4. Return to your data table and confirm that the same record was updated rather than a duplicate record created.
       
    
11. Optional. Extend your genie with a Google Calendar skill.
    
    ### Extend your genie with a Google Calendar skill
    
    You can give your genie skills that benefit from context with conversation memory in place. This step adds a skill that converts messages into Google Calendar events. Users can refine events across several messages because the genie remembers earlier messages.
    
    #### Create a Google Calendar connection
    
    This step creates a connection between Workato and your Google Calendar account to allow your genie to create calendar events on your behalf.
    
    Refer to the following sections to set up your Google Calendar connection:
    
    ##### OAuth 2.0 authentication
    
    Complete the following steps to set up your Google Calendar connection using OAuth 2.0:

Ensure your Google account has sufficient permissions to manage the events and calendars you plan to use in Workato. ![Click Sign in with Google](/assets/google-calendar-sign-in-with-google.DQ57V-DM.png)_Click **Sign in with Google**._
       
    
    ##### Service account authentication
    
    View Service account authentication steps
    
    A Google service account is a specialized Google account associated with a Google Cloud Project (GCP) that can run API requests on your behalf.
    
    Service accounts provide the following benefits:
    
    - **Continuous operation:** Service accounts ensure that operations continue even if individual user permissions change.
    - **Dedicated permissions:** Service accounts can only access projects that you share with them.
    - **Dedicated API quotas:** You can manage a service account's API quotas through GCP and request quota increases directly from Google.
    
    Refer to the [Google service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) to learn more about service accounts.
    
    Service account authentication consists of the following actions:
    
    - [Set up a Google service account](#set-up-a-google-service-account)
    - [Enable the Google Calendar API](#api-setup)
    - [Complete setup in Workato](#setup)
    
    ###### Minimum scopes for service account connections
    
    The following scopes are required to connect to Google Calendar using a service account:
    
    - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
    - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`
    - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.resource.calendar`
    - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks`
    - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`
    
    A `401 Unauthorized error` may occur when the service account uses the `Owner` role or lacks required scopes. Assign the `Editor` role to the service account in the Google Cloud Console and confirm it includes all required scopes listed above. This ensures the service account can authenticate and access Google Calendar successfully.
    
    Refer to the [Google Calendar API scopes](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/auth) documentation for a complete list of supported scopes.
    
    ###### Set up a Google service account

    #### Update your genie task description
    
    This step updates the genie task description to include instructions on how the genie should use the Google Calendar skill.
    
    1. Click the **Assign task to genie** step in the recipe editor.
       
    2. Go to the **Task Description** field and update the description to use the following instructions:
       
       > **DON'T REMOVE THE TELEGRAM DATAPILL**
       > 
       > Don't remove the Telegram datapill you mapped to the **Task Description** field in previous steps.
       
       ```plaintext
       
       Do the following based on the user's message and conversation history:
       
       1. Identify if the message contains an event where you need to set up a calendar event.
       2. If yes, then call the skill to create the event in Google Calendar.
       3. If not, then respond normally.
       4. When responding, you do not need to include your classification of whether it was a task.
       ```
       
    3. Click **Save**.
