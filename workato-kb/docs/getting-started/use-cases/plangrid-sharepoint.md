## Create your recipe

Complete the following steps to create a recipe that synchronizes new and updated safety inspection field reports from PlanGrid to Microsoft SharePoint:

> **USE CASES ARE INTENDED AS EXAMPLES ONLY**
> 
> This use case serves as an example. Modifications to triggers, actions, or conditional logic may be necessary to adapt this recipe to your workflow.

1. Sign in to Workato.
   
2. Select the project where you plan to create the recipe.
   
3. Create connections for PlanGrid and Microsoft SharePoint:
   
   Create a PlanGrid connection.
   
   ### Create a PlanGrid connection
   
   This step creates a connection between Workato and your PlanGrid account.
   
   1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
      
   2. Search for and select `PlanGrid` on the **New connection** page.
      
   3. Provide a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
      
      ![PlanGrid connection setup](/assets/connect.DxkJEN_B.png)_PlanGrid connection setup_
      
   4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
      
   5. Click **Connect**. A PlanGrid OAuth dialog appears.
      
   6. Click **Give Permission** to authorize Workato to establish the connection.
      
   
   Create a Microsoft SharePoint connection.
   
   ### Create a Microsoft SharePoint connection
   
   This step creates a connection between Workato and your Microsoft SharePoint account.
   
   You must have an Azure account to connect Microsoft SharePoint to Workato. Workato supports the following authentication methods:
   
   - [Authorization code grant connection](#authentication-auth-code-grant)
   - [Client credentials grant connection](#authentication-client-cred)
   
   #### Authorization code grant connection
   
   This method requires the following fields:
   
   - **Subdomain**
   - **Client ID** (optional)
   - **Client Secret** (optional)
   
   ##### Step 1: Register the Workato app in Microsoft SharePoint and generate a client ID and secret
   
   Complete the following steps to register the Workato app and generate a client ID and secret for authorization code grant connections:
   
   1. Sign in to your [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
      
   2. Go to **Microsoft Entra ID > Manage > App registrations** and click **New registration**.
      
   3. Enter a name for the application in the **Name** field.
      
   4. Specify who can use this application in the **Supported account type** field.
      
   5. Use the **Select a platform** drop-down menu to select **Web**.
      
   6. Enter `https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback` in the **Redirect URI** field.
      
   7. Click **Register**.
      
   8. Go to **Manage > API permissions** and click **Add a permission**.
      
   9. Select **SharePoint** as your API.
      
   10. Select the **Delegated permissions** option.
       
   11. Expand **AllSites** within the **Select permissions** field and select the **AllSites.Read (Delegated)** checkbox.
       
   12. Go to **Manage > Certificates & secrets** and click **New client secret**.
       
   13. Enter a description for the client secret in the **Description** field.
       
   14. Use the **Expires** drop-down menu to set the expiration date for the client secret.
       
   15. Click **Add** to create the client secret.
       
   16. Click **Copy to clipboard** next to the **Value** after you create the secret. This is your **Client Secret**. Save this value in a secrets vault.
       
   17. Go to **Overview** and copy the **Application (client) ID** value. This is your **Client ID**.
       
   
   You can now configure your Microsoft SharePoint connection in Workato using the API permissions you set up in the Azure Portal.
   
   #### Step 2: Complete setup in Workato
   
   1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
      
   2. Search for and select `Microsoft Sharepoint` on the **New connection** page.
      
   3. Provide a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
      
      ![Microsoft SharePoint connection setup](/assets/connect-auth-code-grant.nAXjo7_o.png)_Microsoft SharePoint connection setup_
      
   4. Use the **Authentication type** drop-down menu to select **Authorization code grant**.
      
   5. Enter your SharePoint subdomain as found in your SharePoint URL in the **Subdomain** field. For example, if your SharePoint URL is `https://abc.sharepoint.com`, the subdomain is `abc`.
      
   6. Enter the client ID generated in SharePoint in the **Client ID** field.
      
   7. Enter the client secret generated in SharePoint in the **Client secret** field.
      
   8. Enter the name of the SharePoint site you plan to connect to in the **Site name** field. If left blank, Workato connects to your default home site. Use the site name as found in the URL of the site page. For example, if the URL is `https://company-name.sharepoint.com/sites/product`, the site name is `product`.
      
   9. Click **Sign in with Microsoft**.
      
   10. Enter your credentials to sign in.
       
   11. Click **Accept** to authorize the app you created in your Azure Portal.
       
   
   ### Client credentials grant connection
   
   This method requires the following values:
   
   - **Subdomain**
   - **Tenant ID**
   - **Client ID**
   - **Certificate**
   - **Private Key**
   
   #### Step 1: Register the Workato application in Microsoft SharePoint
   
   Complete the following steps to register the Workato app and obtain a client ID, secret, and private key for client credentials grant connections.
   
   1. Sign in to your [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
      
   2. Go to **Microsoft Entra ID > Manage > App registrations** and click **New registration**.
      
   3. Enter a name for the application in the **Name** field.
      
   4. Specify who can use this application in the **Supported account type** field.
      
   5. Use the **Select a platform** drop-down menu to select **Web**.
      
   6. Enter `https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback` in the **Redirect URI** field.
      
   7. Click **Register**.
      
   8. Go to **Manage > API permissions** and click **Add a permission**.
      
   9. Select **SharePoint** as your API.
      
   10. Select the **Application permissions** option.
       
   11. Expand **Sites** in the **Select permissions** section and select the **Sites.Read.All (Application)** checkbox. Ensure that admin consent is granted in the **Status** column.
       
   12. Go to **Manage > Certificates & secrets > Certificates** and click **Upload certificate**.
       
   13. Upload a certificate if you already have one. If not, you can generate the certificate locally using tools such as OpenSSL or PowerShell.
       
   14. Go to **Overview** and copy the **Application (client) ID** value. This is your **Client ID**.
       
   15. Copy the **Directory (tenant) ID** value. This is your **Tenant ID**.
