> Create a recipe that searches a Google Drive folder for Google Slides presentations, creates a PDF export for intelligent document processing, and records extracted data in Google Sheets.

# Extract Google Slides data with IDP by Workato

This use case guides you through connecting [Google Drive](/en/connectors/google-drive) and [IDP by Workato](/en/connectors/idp-by-workato) to create a powerful automation.

This recipe searches a Google Drive folder for Google Slides presentations, creates a PDF export for intelligent document processing, and records extracted data in Google Sheets.

## What does this recipe do?

This recipe enables you to extract matching content from Google Slides files stored in your Google Drive using IDP by Workato.

## Create your recipe

Complete the following steps to create a recipe that extracts information you specify from Google Slides and records it in Google Sheets:

1. Sign in to Workato.
   
2. Select the project where you plan to create the recipe.
   
3. Create a connection for Google Drive:
   
   > **WORKATO UTILITY CONNECTORS DON'T REQUIRE SETUP**
   > 
   > The [Scheduler by Workato](/en/features/scheduler) and IDP by Workato connectors don’t require connection setup.
   
   Create a Google Drive connection.
   
   ### Create a Google Drive connection
   
   The Google Drive connector supports the following authentication types:
   
   - [OAuth 2.0 authentication](#oauth2-authentication)
   - [Service account](#service-account-authentication)
   
   #### OAuth 2.0 authentication
   
   OAuth 2.0 authentication requires specific permissions and scopes.
   
   View Google Drive OAuth 2.0 connection setup steps.
   
   #### Minimum and default scopes
   
   Workato requests the following scopes by default in addition to the scopes you select:
   
   - `drive`: See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Drive files
   - `drive.readonly`: See and download all your Google Drive files
   
   Additionally, your Google account must have the `Edit` permission for all files and folders that you plan to use in Workato recipes.
   
   #### Connect to Google Drive using OAuth 2.0
   
   Complete the following steps to set up an OAuth 2.0 connection to in Workato:
   
   1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
      
   2. Search for and select **Google Drive** as your connection on the **New Connection** page.
      
   3. Enter a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
      
      ![Connection setup](/assets/google-drive-connection-setup.o_esWDm7.png)_Google Drive connection setup_
      
   4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
      
   5. Use the **Authentication type** drop-down menu to select **OAuth 2.0**.
      
   6. Optional. Expand the **Advanced settings** section and use the **Requested permissions** drop-down menu to specify OAuth scopes to request for your connection.
      
   7. Optional. Use the **Custom OAuth profile** drop-down menu to select a custom OAuth profile to use for the connection.
      
   8. Click **Sign in with Google**.
      
   9. Click **Allow** to authorize Workato to access your Google Drive.
      
   
   #### Service account authentication
   
   Service account authentication requires a Google service account and an enabled Google Workspace API.
   
   View service account connection setup steps.
   
   A Google service account is a specialized Google account associated with a Google Cloud Project (GCP) that can run API requests on your behalf.
   
   Service accounts provide the following benefits:
   
   - **Continuous operation:** Service accounts ensure that operations continue even if individual user permissions change.
   - **Dedicated permissions:** Service accounts can only access projects that you share with them.
   - **Dedicated API quotas:** You can manage a service account's API quotas through GCP and request quota increases directly from Google.
   
   Refer to the [Google service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) to learn more about service accounts.
   
   ##### Set up a Google service account
   
   Complete the following steps to set up a Google service account:
   
   1. [Create a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating) in your GCP project.
      
   2. Go to **IAM & Admin > Service accounts**. Ensure your dashboard is scoped to the project that contains your service account.
      
      ![Check the scope of your dashboard.](/assets/service-project-scope.8Rf50DK2.png)_Check the scope of your dashboard._
      
   3. Click the **Email** of the service account you intend to use.
      
      ![Click the email of the service account you intend to use.](/assets/service-email-button.C9qaZFkJ.png)_Click the **Email** of the service account you intend to use._
      
   4. Copy the service account's **Email** and save it to configure your connection later.
      
      ![Copy the account's email](/assets/service-account-email.DM6BBBhN.png)_Copy the account's **Email**._
      
   5. Go to the **KEYS** tab.
      
   6. [Generate a private key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating_service_account_keys) and download it in JSON format. You can only download the key once.
      
   7. Open the JSON file, then copy the entire private key from `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` to `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n` (inclusive) and save it to configure your connection later.
      
   
   ##### Connect to Google Drive using service account authentication
   
   Service account authentication requires the following prerequisites:
   
   - [Create a service account and generate a private key](#service-account-setup)
   - [Enable the Google Workspace API](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841)
   
   Complete the following steps to set up a service account connection to Google Drive in Workato:
   
   1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
      
   2. Search for `Google Drive` and select it as your app.
      
   3. Enter a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
      
   4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
      
   5. Use the **Authentication type** drop-down menu to select **Service account**.
      
   6. Enter the service account's email address in the **GCP project service account email** field.
      
      ![Retrieve your GCP Project service account email](/assets/service-auth-email.BdQybqOr.png)_Retrieve your GCP Project service account email_
      
   7. Enter the **Private key**. Retrieve the private key from the downloadable JSON. Include both `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n`.
      
   8. Optional. Enter the **User email** of the account to impersonate. If left blank, Workato accesses the service account's Drive.
      
      User impersonation lets the service account act on behalf of a designated user, accessing and managing events in their Google Drive. Impersonating a user ensures data accuracy and enforces the permissions and access controls set for that user in Google Drive. Refer to Google's [Service account impersonation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-impersonation) guide for more information.
      
   9. Optional. Expand the **Advanced settings** section and use the **Requested permissions** drop-down menu to specify OAuth scopes to request for your connection.
      
   10. Click **Sign in with Google**.
       
   
4. Go back to your project and click **Create > Recipe** or press C+R.
