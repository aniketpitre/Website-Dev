## Create your recipe

Complete the following steps to create a recipe that syncs employees from Quickbase to Oracle EBS and then posts a notification in Slack.

> **USE CASES ARE INTENDED AS EXAMPLES ONLY**
> 
> This use case serves as an example. Modifications to triggers, actions, or conditional logic may be necessary to adapt this recipe to your workflow.

1. Sign in to Workato.
