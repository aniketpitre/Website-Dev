> Build a recipe that connects Marketo, Salesforce, and Snowflake to create tasks and insert rows when new lead activity is detected.

# Create Salesforce tasks and Snowflake rows from Marketo lead activity recipe

This use case guides you through connecting [Marketo](/en/connectors/marketo), [Salesforce](/en/connectors/salesforce), and [Snowflake](/en/connectors/snowflake) to Workato to create a powerful automation.

## What does this recipe do?

This recipe monitors Marketo for new lead activity. The recipe creates a new task in Salesforce and inserts a new row in Snowflake when new lead activity is detected in Marketo.

## Create your recipe

Complete the following steps to create a recipe that monitors Marketo for new lead activity and then creates a new task in Salesforce and inserts a new row with the lead information in Snowflake when activity is detected:

> **USE CASES ARE INTENDED AS EXAMPLES ONLY**
> 
> This use case serves as an example. Modifications to triggers, actions, or conditional logic may be necessary to adapt this recipe to your workflow.

1. Sign in to Workato.
   
2. Select the project where you plan to create the recipe.
   
3. Create connections for Marketo, Salesforce, and Snowflake:
   
   Create a Marketo connection.
   
   ### Create a Marketo connection
   
   This step creates a connection between Workato and your Marketo account.
   
   1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
      
   2. Search for and select `Marketo` on the **New connection** page.
      
   3. Provide a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
      
      ![Marketo connection setup](/assets/connect.CJv1T1Wp.png)_Marketo connection setup_
      
   4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
      
   5. Enter the base URL of your Marketo instance in the **REST Endpoint** field. Refer to the [Marketo Base URL documentation](https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/base-url/) for information on how to find your base URL.
      
   6. Enter the ID for the custom service client in the **Custom service client ID** field.
      
   7. Enter the password for the custom service client in the **Custom service client secret** field.
      
   8. Click **Connect**.
      
   
   Create a Salesforce connection.
   
   ### Create a Salesforce connection
   
   This step creates a connection between Workato and your Salesforce account.
   
   1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
      
   2. Search for and select `Salesforce` on the **New connection** page.
      
   3. Provide a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
      
      ![Salesforce connection setup](/assets/connect.CnntY3nd.png)_Salesforce connection setup_
      
   4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
      
   5. Use the **Auth type** drop-down menu to select the authentication method. The default is OAuth 2.0.
      
   6. Use the **Sandbox** drop-down menu to specify whether the Salesforce account is a sandbox account.
      
   7. Optional. Expand **Advanced settings** to configure advanced connection options.
      
   8. Optional. Use the **Custom OAuth profile** drop-down menu to select a custom OAuth profile for your connection.
      
      - This custom OAuth profile ensures that the connection is restricted to the same set of scopes you selected for all users with the profile, and the authentication flow uses the client app linked to the custom profile.
   9. Click **Connect**.
      
   10. Enter your Salesforce account credentials and click **Log In**.
       
       ![Salesforce connection setup](/assets/login.CIu5oc0P.png)_Log in to your Salesforce account_
       
   
   Create a Snowflake connection.
   
   ### Create a Snowflake connection
   
   This step creates a connection between Workato and your Snowflake account.
   
   1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
      
   2. Search for and select `Snowflake` on the **New connection** page.
      
   3. Provide a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.

      - Account name: `https://{org.name}-{account_name}`
      - Connection name: `https://{org.name}-{connectionname}`
      - Account locator: `https://{account.locator}.{region}.{cloud}`
      
      If you're using the account locator, note that `{region}` and `{cloud}` are only required for certain locations. For example:
      
      - If your account is hosted in AWS US West (Oregon), use `your-account-locator`.
      - If your account is hosted in AWS US East (Ohio), use `your-account-locator.us-east-2`.
      - If your account is hosted in Azure West Europe, use `your-account-locator.west-europe.azure`.
   6. Enter the full name of the warehouse where you plan to perform all operations for this connection in the **Warehouse** field. For example, `compute_wh`.
      
   7. Enter the database you plan to use in your recipe connection in the **Database name** field.
      
   8. Use the **Authentication type** drop-down menu to select your authentication type.
      
      - **Username/Password**: Enter your username and password if you select this option.
      - **OAuth 2.0**: Enter your Client ID and Client Secret if you select this option.
   9. Click **Connect**.
