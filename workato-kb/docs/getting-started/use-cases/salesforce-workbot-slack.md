> Build a recipe that displays Salesforce account details in Slack with Workbot, surfacing customer info from a Slack command.

# Display Salesforce account details with Workbot for Slack recipe

This use case guides you through connecting [Salesforce](/en/connectors/salesforce) and [Workbot for Slack](/en/workbot/workbot#workbot-for-slack) to Workato to create a powerful automation.

## What does this recipe do?

This recipe enables Workbot for Slack to display Salesforce customer account details directly within Slack. This automation triggers when a specific command is entered into Slack, bringing critical customer information directly to where discussions are happening without the need to switch applications or disrupt your workflow.

## Create your recipe

Complete the following steps to create a recipe that displays Salesforce account details in Slack:

> **USE CASES ARE INTENDED AS EXAMPLES ONLY**
> 
> This use case serves as an example. Modifications to triggers, actions, or conditional logic may be necessary to adapt this recipe to your workflow.

1. Sign in to Workato.
   
2. Select the project where you plan to create the recipe.
   
3. Create connections for Salesforce and Workbot for Slack:
   
   Create a Salesforce connection.
   
   ### Create a Salesforce connection
   
   This step creates a connection between Workato and your Salesforce account.
   
   1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
      
   2. Search for and select `Salesforce` on the **New connection** page.
      
   3. Provide a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
      
      ![Salesforce connection setup](/assets/connect.CnntY3nd.png)_Salesforce connection setup_
      
   4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
      
   5. Use the **Auth type** drop-down menu to select the authentication method. The default is OAuth 2.0.
      
   6. Use the **Sandbox** drop-down menu to specify whether the Salesforce account is a sandbox account.
      
   7. Optional. Expand **Advanced settings** to configure advanced connection options.
      
   8. Optional. Use the **Custom OAuth profile** drop-down menu to select a custom OAuth profile for your connection.
      
      - This custom OAuth profile ensures that the connection is restricted to the same set of scopes you selected for all users with the profile, and the authentication flow uses the client app linked to the custom profile.
   9. Click **Connect**.
      
   10. Enter your Salesforce account credentials and click **Log In**.
       
       ![Salesforce connection setup](/assets/login.CIu5oc0P.png)_Log in to your Salesforce account_
       
   
   Create a Workbot for Slack connection.
   
   ### Create a Workbot for Slack connection

   2. Search for and select `Workbot for Slack` on the **New connection** page.
      
   3. Provide a name for your connection in the **Name** field.
      
      ![Workbot for Slack connection setup](/assets/connect.DudoV0Fs.png)_Workbot for Slack connection setup_
      
   4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.

   7. Click **Connect**, sign in to your Slack workspace when prompted, and click **Continue** to verify the connection.
      
   
4. Go back to your project and click **Create > Recipe** or press C+R.

    How do IF conditions work?
    
    ### Salesforce and Workbot for Slack IF condition example
    
    An [IF condition](/en/features/if-conditions) enables you to make decisions based on specific conditions. You can control your recipe workflow by executing different actions depending on whether a condition you specify is present or not present (true or false).
    
    ```mermaid
    flowchart TD
        A([Search accounts in Salesforce]) --> B(Is the account present?)
        B -->|Yes| C(Return the account details in Slack.)
        B ---->|No| E(Return a message in Slack that the account is not present in Salesforce.)
