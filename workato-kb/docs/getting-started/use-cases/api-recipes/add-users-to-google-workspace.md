# Add users to Google Workspace

This use case provides step-by-step instructions to create an API recipe and a custom endpoint that adds users to Google Workspace programmatically or when a new employee is detected in BambooHR. This allows you to automate user provisioning from your CLI (command line interface) or HR system rather than manually logging into Google Admin console to add each new hire or batches of new hires.

> **USE CASES ARE INTENDED AS EXAMPLES ONLY**
> 
> Use cases are intended to serve as examples. API recipe modifications such as API trigger configuration, action configuration, and conditional logic may require adjustments for your specific setup.

## What does this API recipe do?

This API recipe enables you to add users to your Google Workspace programmatically or when a new employee is detected in BambooHR.

## Create your API recipe

Complete the following steps to create an API recipe that adds new employees to Google Workspace:

1. Sign in to Workato.
   
2. Select the project where you plan to create the recipe.
   
3. Create a connection for Google Workspace.
   
   ### Create a connection for Google Workspace
   
   This step creates a connection between Workato and your Google Workspace account. The Google Workspace connector supports the following authentication methods:
   
   - [OAuth 2.0](#oauth-2-0-authentication)
   - [Service account](#service-account-authentication)
   
   #### OAuth 2.0 authentication
   
   Complete the following steps to connect to Google Workspace using OAuth 2.0 authentication:
   
   1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
      
   2. Search for and select **Google Workspace** as your connection.
      
   3. Provide a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
      
   4. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to select the project where you plan to store the connection.
      
   5. Use the **Authentication type** drop-down menu to select **OAuth 2.0**.
      
   6. Optional. Expand the **Advanced settings** section and select OAuth 2.0 scopes to request for your connection.
      
      Workato requests the following scopes by default in addition to the scopes you select:
      
      | Description | Scope requested |
      | --- | --- |
      | View and manage the provisioning of users on your domain | `admin.directory.user` |

12. Click **\+ Add step** and select **Handle errors**.
    
    ![Add action](/assets/add-step-standard.DEbq8cJp.png)_Click **Add step > Handle errors**_
    
    How does the Handle errors control statement work?
    
    The [Handle errors control statement](/en/recipes/steps#handle-errors-step) allows you to monitor your recipe for errors in actions, similar to the try/catch concept in programming languages. You have the opportunity to perform the following actions if an error occurs:
    
    - Retry the sequence of actions again, in case it was a temporary error such as network issues.
      
    - Take remedial actions, such as notifying users of the error through email or error messages in the app, or to carry out a rollback. For example, you can reverse the job by deleting any created or half-created records.
      
    
    This control statement consists of two blocks: the **Monitor** block and the **Error** block. Place the actions that you plan to monitor for errors within the **Monitor** block. If all actions are successful, Workato ignores the **Error** block. However, if any action in the **Monitor** block results in an error, the actions within the **Error** block are executed.
    
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A(Monitor action for errors) ---> B((Error found?))
        B --> C{Yes}
        B --> D{No}
        C --> E(Define how to <br/> handle the error)
        D --> F(Continue processing <br/> the recipe)

    ```
    
13. Set up your Google Workspace add user action.
    
    ### Set up your Google Workspace add user action
    
    This step adds a user to Google Workspace. Note that this step is nested within the **Monitor** block.
    
    1. Search for and select Google Workspace as the app to monitor.
       
    2. Select **Add record** as your action.
       
    3. Use the **Object** drop-down menu to select **Users**.
       
    4. Expand the **Name** field and map the lastname (Step 1) datapill to the **Surname** field.
       
    5. Map the firstname (Step 1) datapill to the **First name** field.
       
    6. Enter the user's email address in the **Primary email** field.
       
       ![Add user action](/assets/add-user-action.CSI1nxGY.png)_Add user action_
       
    7. Click **Save**.
       
    
14. Configure your ERROR FOUND? block.
    
    This step tells your recipe how to respond if it receives an error when it executes the **Add user** action.
    
    Complete the following steps to configure your **ERROR FOUND?** block:
    
    1. Go to the **ERROR FOUND?** block and confirm that the **Yes** branch shows **DO NOT RETRY**. This option is usually set by default.
       
       ![Error found block](/assets/error-found-block.B-zgqhof.png)_**ERROR FOUND?** block_
       
    2. Go to the **Yes** branch and click **Select and app and action**.
       
    3. Search for and select API platform by Workato as your app.

## Create an API collection and API endpoint

This section provides steps on how to create a new API collection and API endpoint.

Complete the following steps to create an API collection:

1. Create an API collection.
   
   ### Create an API collection
   
   This section provides steps on how to create a new API collection where you can store your Google Workspace API endpoint.
   
   1. Go to **Platform > API platform**.
      
   2. Click the **API collections** tab.
      
   3. Click **\+ Create new collection**.
      
   4. Ensure that **API recipe collection** is selected and then click **Next**.
      
   5. Ensure that **Use existing recipes** is selected.
      
   6. Use the **Recipe folder** drop-down menu to select the folder where you plan to store the API collection.
      
   7. Deselect all endpoints.
      
   8. Enter a name in the **Collection name** field.
      
   9. Enter a version number for your collection. For example: `v1`.
      
   10. Optional. Provide a description for the collection in the **Description** field.
       
   11. Click **Create collection**.
       
       ![Set collection details](/assets/set-collection-details.Dd-H23_w.png)_Click **Create collection**_
       
   
2. Create a new endpoint.
   
   ### Create an endpoint
   
   This step creates a new endpoint based on your API request recipe and stores it in your API collection.
   
   1. Go to **Platform > API platform**.
      
   2. Click the **API collections** tab.
      
   3. Select the API collection you created in the preceding steps.
      
   4. Click **Create new endpoint**.
      
   5. Use the **Recipe** drop-down menu to select the API request recipe you created in the preceding steps.
      
   6. Use the **HTTP method** drop-down menu to select **POST**.
      
   7. Enter a name for your endpoint in the **Endpoint name** field.
      
   8. Define a path for your endpoint in the **Endpoint path** field. For example: `add-google-workspace-user-v1`. Don't include a slash `\` in your endpoint path. This is automatically appended after you create the endpoint.
      
   9. Optional. Provide a description in the **Endpoint description** field.
      
   10. Optional. Set a timeout value in the **Request timeout** field. The default value is `30` seconds and the maximum value is `240` seconds.
       
   11. Click **Add endpoint**.
       
       ![Create an endpoint](/assets/create-google-workspace-endpoint.B1QPCnl_.png)_Create an endpoint_
       
   

## Add users from a CLI

You can use your endpoint to add users directly from your CLI.

How does a curl command work?

Your curl command can be broken down to the following items:

- `-X POST`: Uses the POST HTTP method
- `https://apim.workato.com/<your-workspace-name>/<your-endpoint-name>`: Your API endpoint URL. You must replace `<your-workspace-name>` and `<your-endpoint-name>` your actual workspace and endpoint names.
- `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`: Specifies JSON format.
- `-H "API-Token: <your-api-token>"`: Authentication header. You must replace `<your-api-token>` with your actual API token. -`-d '{"username": "janderson", "firstname": "Jade", "lastname": "Anderson"}'`: The request body with the three required fields from your request schema: `username`, `firstname`, and `lastname`.

The actual base URL and authentication method depend on how your Workato API collection is configured. You can find the exact URL and authentication details in your API collection settings under **Platform > API platform > API collections**.

```shell
curl -X POST https://apim.workato.com/<your-workspace-name>/<your-endpoint-name>\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "API-Token: <your-api-token>" \
  -d '{
    "users": [
      {"username": "janderson", "firstname": "Jade", "lastname": "Anderson"},
      {"username": "jhernandez", "firstname": "Josh", "lastname": "Hernandez"},
      {"username": "ssingh", "firstname": "Sanjeev", "lastname": "Singh"},
      {"username": "etan", "firstname": "Emily", "lastname": "Tan"},
      {"username": "amiller", "firstname": "Alex", "lastname": "Miller"}
    ]
  }'
```

Complete the following steps to use your API endpoint to add users to Google Workspace programmatically from your CLI:

1. Open your preferred CLI, such as Cursor or VSCode.
   
2. Run the following command, updating `<your-workspace-name>`, `<your-endpoint-name>`, and `<your-api-token>` to match your configuration:
   
   ![Run the command in your CLI](/assets/cli-curl-command.uA7XREh7.gif)_Run the command in your CLI_
   

## Add users through a BambooHR trigger

Complete the following steps to add users to Google Workspace when a new employee is detected in BambooHR:

1. Sign in to Workato.
   
2. Select the project where you plan to create the recipe.
   
3. Create a connection for BambooHR. The HTTP connector doesn't require connection setup.
   
   Create a BambooHR connection.
   
   ### Create a BambooHR connection
   
   This step creates a connection between BambooHR and your Workato account. Refer to [BambooHR](/en/connectors/bamboo-hr#how-to-connect-to-bamboo-hr-on-workato) for more information.
   
   Complete the following steps to set up your BambooHR connection:
   
   1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
