> Build a personal assistant genie that connects to Telegram, processes incoming messages, and automates scheduling through a custom skill.

# Build a personal assistant genie with Telegram

This use case connects your Telegram account to a genie configured with a specialized skill that turns your genie into a personal assistant. The genie automates your scheduling workflow by intelligently evaluating incoming Telegram messages and creating Google Calendar events for meetings, appointments, or reminders on your behalf. This removes the need to manually switch between apps to log appointments.

## What does this genie do?

This genie enables you to connect Telegram to a Workato recipe and genie to process incoming messages intelligently. It uses a custom skill to teach your genie how to detect calendar events in messages and create Google Calendar events automatically.

   Refer to the following sections to set up your Google Calendar connection:
   
   #### OAuth 2.0 authentication
   
   Complete the following steps to set up your Google Calendar connection using OAuth 2.0:
   
   View OAuth 2.0 authentication steps
   
   1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
      
   2. Search for and select `Google Calendar` as your connection on the **New connection** page.
      
   3. Provide a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
      
   4. Select the project where you plan to store the connection from the **Location** drop-down menu.
      
   5. Select **OAuth 2.0** as the **Authentication type**.
      
   6. Click **Sign in with Google**, then sign in to your Google account. Ensure your Google account has sufficient permissions to manage the events and calendars you plan to use in Workato. ![Click Sign in with Google](/assets/google-calendar-sign-in-with-google.DQ57V-DM.png)_Click **Sign in with Google**._
      
   
   #### Service account authentication
   
   View Service account authentication steps
   
   A Google service account is a specialized Google account associated with a Google Cloud Project (GCP) that can run API requests on your behalf.
   
   Service accounts provide the following benefits:
   
   - **Continuous operation:** Service accounts ensure that operations continue even if individual user permissions change.
   - **Dedicated permissions:** Service accounts can only access projects that you share with them.
   - **Dedicated API quotas:** You can manage a service account's API quotas through GCP and request quota increases directly from Google.
   
   Refer to the [Google service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) to learn more about service accounts.
   
   Service account authentication consists of the following actions:
   
   - [Set up a Google service account](#set-up-a-google-service-account)
   - [Enable the Google Calendar API](#api-setup)
   - [Complete setup in Workato](#setup)
   
   ##### Minimum scopes for service account connections
   
   The following scopes are required to connect to Google Calendar using a service account:
   
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.resource.calendar`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`
   
   A `401 Unauthorized error` may occur when the service account uses the `Owner` role or lacks required scopes. Assign the `Editor` role to the service account in the Google Cloud Console and confirm it includes all required scopes listed above. This ensures the service account can authenticate and access Google Calendar successfully.
   
   Refer to the [Google Calendar API scopes](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/auth) documentation for a complete list of supported scopes.
   
   ##### Set up a Google service account
   
   View Set up a Google service account steps
   
   Complete the following steps to set up a Google service account:
   
   1. [Create a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating) in your GCP project.
      
   2. Go to **IAM & Admin > Service accounts**. Ensure your dashboard is scoped to the project that contains your service account. ![Check the scope of your dashboard.](/assets/service-project-scope.8Rf50DK2.png)_Check the scope of your dashboard._
      
   3. Click the **Email** of the service account you intend to use. ![Click the email of the service account you intend to use.](/assets/service-email-button.C9qaZFkJ.png)_Click the **Email** of the service account you intend to use._
      
   4. Copy the service account's **Email** and save it to configure your connection later. ![Copy the account's email](/assets/service-account-email.DM6BBBhN.png)_Copy the account's **Email**._
      
   5. Go to the **KEYS** tab.
      
   6. [Generate a private key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating_service_account_keys) and download it in JSON format. You can only download the key once.
      
   7. Open the JSON file, then copy the entire private key from `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` to `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n` (inclusive) and save it to configure your connection later.
      
   
   ##### Enable the Google Calendar API
   
   View Enable the Google Calendar API steps
   
   You must enable the Google Calendar API before you return to Workato to finish setting up your connection.
   
   1. Sign in to Google's [API library](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library).
      
   2. Search for and select the `Google Calendar API`.
