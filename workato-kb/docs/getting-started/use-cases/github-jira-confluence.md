> Build a recipe that creates weekly Confluence release notes and Jira comments from closed GitHub issues.

# Create summarized Confluence notes and Jira comments from closed GitHub PRs recipe

This use case guides you through connecting [GitHub](/en/connectors/github), [Jira](/en/connectors/jira), and [Confluence](/en/connectors/confluence) to create a powerful automation.

## What does this recipe do?

This recipe generates weekly release notes in Confluence based on closed issues from a GitHub repository.

The recipe searches for closed issues, compiles them into a list, and creates a Confluence page with the closed issues. Additionally, if a GitHub issue references a specific Jira ticket in its body, the recipe adds a comment to the corresponding Jira ticket.

    1. Search for `Variables by Workato` and select it as your app.
       
       ![Choose Variables by Workato](/assets/choose.DetQOqPQ.png)_Choose Variables by Workato_
       
    2. Select the **Add items to list** action.
       
       ![Select the Add items to list action](/assets/add-items-to-list.CPcBZWwY.png)_Select the Add items to list action_
       
    3. Select **Releases (step 2)** in the **List name** field.
       
    4. Select **End of the list** in the **Insert location** field.
       
    5. Expand the **List item** field.
       
    6. Complete the following actions in **Details** field:
       
       1. Map the Title (Step 4) datapill.
          
       2. Type `(<a href="`.
          
       3. Map the Html URL (Step 4) datapill.
          
       4. Type `">#`.
          
       5. Map the Number (Step 4) datapill.

    ![Add IF condition](/assets/if-condition-standard.DI59XkdU.png)_Click **Add step > IF condition**_
    
    How do IF conditions work?
    
    ### Add issue IF condition example
    
    An [IF condition](/en/features/if-conditions) enables you to make decisions based on specific conditions. You can control your recipe workflow by executing different actions depending on whether a condition you specify is present or not present (true or false).
    
    ```mermaid
    flowchart TD
        A([Add issue to Releases list]) --> B("Does the issue body contain a string in the format <code>Jira:ABC-123</code>?")
        B -->|Yes| C(Add comment to the corresponding Jira issue)
        B ---->|No| E(Do nothing)

        classDef default fill:#67eadd,stroke:#b3e0e1,stroke-width:2px,color:#000;
        classDef WorkatoPink fill:#f3c1c2,stroke:#f3c1c2,stroke-width:1px;
        class E WorkatoPink
    ```
    
19. Set up your IF condition.
    
    ### Set up IF condition
    
    This step checks if the body of each issue contains a Jira ticket reference.
    
    1. Map the Body (Step 4) datapill to the **Data field**.
       
    2. Select **is present** in the **Condition** field.
       
       This condition checks that the issue body of the current issue being processed is neither empty nor null, preventing errors when applying formulas in the next step.
       
    3. Click `+` (plus) and select **AND** to add a second condition.
       
    4. Switch **Data field** to [formula mode](/en/formulas/formula-mode) and do the following:
       
       1. Map the Body (Step 4) datapill.
          
       2. Append the `.match?(/Jira:w+-\d+/)` formula.
          
          This formula checks if the `Body` of the GitHub issue contains a Jira ticket reference in the format `Jira:ABC-123`.
          
    5. Select **equals** in the **Condition** field.
       
    6. Go to the **Value** field, switch to [formula mode](/en/formulas/formula-mode), and type `true`.
       
       ![IF condition configuration](/assets/if-condition.BFvLJuWj.png)_IF condition configuration_
       
    7. Click **Save**.
       
    
20. Click **Select an app and action**.
    
21. Set up your Jira Create comment action.
    
    ### Set up Jira Create comment action
    
    This step creates a comment in the corresponding Jira ticket if the recipe detects a Jira reference in the issue body. The comment indicates that the issue was closed in GitHub, along with the issue number and a hyperlink to the issue.
    
    1. Search for `Jira` and select it as your app.
       
       ![Choose Jira](/assets/choose.Cz1B1oV7.png)_Choose Jira_

    4. Complete the following actions in the **Issue ID or key** field:
       
       1. Map the Body (Step 4) datapill.
          
       2. Append the `.match?(/Jira:w+-\d+/)` formula.
          
          ![Issue ID or key configuration](/assets/issue-id-or-key-configuration.DpNu8xVY.png)_Issue ID or key configuration_
          
    5. Complete the following actions in the **Comment text** field:
       
       1. Type `Closed by Github #`.
          
       2. Map the Number (Step 4) datapill next to the hash `#` symbol.
          
       3. Enter a new line and map the Html URL (Step 4) datapill.
          
          ![Comment text configuration](/assets/comment-text-configuration.ALfpvnCs.png)_Comment text configuration_
          
    6. Click **Save**.
       
    
22. Click **\+ Add step** and select **Action in app**.
    
23. Set up your Confluence Create page action.
    
    ### Set up your Confluence Create page action
    
    This step creates a Confluence page listing the GitHub issues that were closed since the beginning of the past week.
    
    1. Search for `Confluence` and select it as your app.
       
       ![Choose Confluence](/assets/choose.BcDbzAxu.png)_Choose Confluence_
       
    2. Select the **Create page** action.
       
       ![Select the Create page action](/assets/create-page.D7F6BwNa.png)_Select the Create page action_
       
    3. Enter the Confluence space key in the **Space key** field. You can find this value in the URL of your Confluence space page.
       
    4. Switch the **Title** field to [formula mode](/en/formulas/formula-mode) and enter the following:
       
       ```ruby
       "Product release (" + today.beginning_of_week.strftime("%d %B %Y") +")"
       ```
       
       This sets the title of your Confluence release notes page. For example, `Product release (1 October 2024)`.
       
       ![Title configuration](/assets/title-configuration.oqZr4RPx.png)_Title configuration_
       
    5. Switch the **Body** field to [formula mode](/en/formulas/formula-mode) and do the following:
       
       1. Type `"<p>" +`.
          
       2. Map the Releases (Step 2) datapill.
          
       3. Type the following formulas:
          
          ```ruby
          .pluck('Details').join("<br/><br/">)
          ```
          
       4. Type `+ "</p>`.
          
       
       This code constructs an HTML paragraph that contains the details from the **Releases** list, with each detail separated by two line breaks (`<br/><br/>`).
