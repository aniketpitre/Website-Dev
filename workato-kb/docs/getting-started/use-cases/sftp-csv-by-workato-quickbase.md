> **USE CASES ARE INTENDED AS EXAMPLES ONLY**
> 
> This use case serves as an example. Modifications to triggers, actions, or conditional logic may be necessary to adapt this recipe to your workflow.

1. Sign in to Workato.
   
2. Select the project where you plan to create the recipe.
   
3. Create connections for SFTP and Quickbase.
   
   > **WORKATO UTILITY CONNECTORS DON'T REQUIRE SETUP**
   > 
   > The CSV tools by Workato connector doesn't require connection setup.
   
   Create a SFTP connection.
   
   ### Create a SFTP connection
   
   This step creates an SFTP connection for your recipe.
   
   #### Using SSH keys for SFTP authentication
   
   SFTP is built on the Secure Shell Protocol (SSH), which enables you to use SSH keys in your authentication flow. SSH keys can be used with a user ID and password or independently to authenticate Workato with your SFTP server. This enhances the security of your connection by using SSH encryption for your public and private keys.
   
   #### Connection setup
   
   Complete the following steps to set up your SFTP connection:
   
   1. Click **Create > Connection** or press C twice.
      
   2. Search for and select `SFTP` on the **New connection** page.
      
   3. Provide a name for your connection in the **Connection name** field.
