# Page components

This guide describes the types of page components available in Workflow apps and how to customize each component type using the properties panel.

Workflow apps includes built-in validation of user input for many page components. This includes validation of all [Contact](#contact) components (email, phone numbers, and URLs), and [Number](#number) components. Additionally, Workflow apps offers [custom field validation](/en/workflow-apps/custom-field-validation) for short-answer text components.

Additionally, you can [duplicate existing components](/en/workflow-apps/page-components-modify#duplicate-components) and reuse them within your page. This saves time during app development by allowing you to quickly reuse and modify components while maintaining design consistency across your page.

The left panel of the editor is the [Content](#content) and [Background](#background) panel. This panel allows you to add content to your page by dragging and dropping components onto the [Page canvas](/en/workflow-apps/pages-customize#page-canvas) and set the page background. It also contains a search bar which enables you to find components quickly and easily.

The right panel of the editor is the Properties panel. This panel enables you to configure components to customize the appearance and behavior of your page.

> **DASHBOARD PAGES**
> 
> Dashboard pages do not support all content components and are limited to **Chart** components and **Display** components (**container**, **divider**, **image**, and **text**).
> 
> Conversely, the **Chart** component is only supported by dashboard pages and is not offered on approval, submission, and blank pages.

## Content

Decide what content appears on your page. Workflow apps supports the following types of components:

| Component type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Data table](#data-table) | Display data from your app's primary data table. Each column is treated as an individual component. _**This section is available only in applications that support request and approval functionality, which can be enabled when you [create a new tab](/en/workflow-apps/interface#workflow-enable).**_ |
| [Tables linked from {App-name}](#linked-data-tables) | Display data from tables linked to your Workflow app's primary data table. This component enables you to display this data as a table, either in its entirety, or only the data columns you specify. You can create new linked data tables using [view components](#view). _**This section is available only in applications that support request and approval functionality, which can be enabled when you [create a new tab](/en/workflow-apps/interface#workflow-enable).**_ |
| [Charts](#chart) | Query data and display data visualizations. _**Only available for dashboard pages.**_ |
| [Display](#display) | Determine the look and feel of your application. |
| [Text](#text) | Gather free form user input in the form of short answer or long answer text. Workflow apps supports custom form validation for short answer components with regex. Learn more about [custom field validation](/en/workflow-apps/custom-field-validation). |
| [Contact](#contact) | Gather user contact information, such as emails, phone numbers, and URLs. Workflow apps validates user input and ensures it matches the type of user contact information you specify. |
| [Number](#number) | Collect numerical values. Workflow apps validates user input and ensures all data entered into fields of this type are numerical values. |
| [Date](#date) | Collect dates. Workflow apps validates user input and ensures it matches the format you specify (date or date and time). |
| [Choices](#choices) | Gather user input from a list of options or yes/no questions. Specific choice components support multi-value selection in pages. Drop-down components also support [Run recipe](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/run-recipe) and [Reset/reload components](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/reset-components) actions. |
| [View](#view) | Connect additional linked data tables to your Workflow app and display them in your application. This component enables you to display this data as a table, either in its entirety, or only the data columns you specify. Table components also support [Run recipe](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/run-recipe) and [Reset/reload components](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/reset-components) actions. |
| [Button](#button) | Enable user actions such as saving data to your app, completing tasks, or opening a URL. support [Run recipe](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/run-recipe) and [Reset/reload components](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/reset-components) actions. |
| [File](#file) | Upload or download files to/from your app. |

### Data table

The **Data tables** section is available only in applications that support request and approval functionality, which can be enabled when you [create a new tab](/en/workflow-apps/interface#workflow-enable).

This section contains components that correspond to a specific data column in your Workflow app's primary data table. Each column is represented as an individual component that you can drag and drop onto your page.

![Each component represents a column](/assets/data-table-panel.DsPR9Sk4.png)_Each component represents a column in your app's primary data table_

#### Add columns to your primary data table

Add columns to this table in the page editor by clicking **+** (plus) next to the data table name. Alternatively, you can edit table content and schema in the [Data tables](/en/data-tables) interface by following the link to the data table.

![Add column from editor](/assets/add-column-from-editor.1P3Fcx4j.png)_Add column from editor_

When you add components to your page, you can elect to save user input to existing columns in your primary data table or create new columns in which to save the data.

See the [Create a page](/en/workflow-apps/pages-create) section for more information on submission forms and how to submit data to a data table.

View data table properties

The properties available for data table components depend on the [column type](/en/data-tables/user-interface/column-types) in the corresponding data table.

The following table describes the relationship between column types and page components:

| Column type | Page component | Component category |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Short text | Short text, URL, email, or phone number | Text or Contact |
| Long text | Long text, URL, email, or phone number | Text or Contact |
| Integer | Number | Number |
| Decimal | Number | Number |
| Boolean | Checkbox | Choices |
| Multi-value | Multi-select | Choices |
| Date | Date | Date |
| DateTime | Date and time | Date |
| File | Upload file or download file | File |
| Link to a table | Tables linked to **{Primary data table}** | Tables linked |

* * *

### Linked data tables

The **Linked data tables** section is available only in applications that support request and approval functionality, which you can enable when you [create a new tab](/en/workflow-apps/interface#workflow-enable).

This section of the page editor displays all secondary data tables linked to your Workflow app's primary data table. Each secondary data table is represented as an individual component to enable you to display the entire table on your page.

![Linked data tables](/assets/linked-tables-component.eS6MLIAJ.png)_Display linked data tables in your pages_

View linked data tables design properties

Use the properties panel to customize how these tables display on your page. For example, you can choose to display only a limited set of columns from this table, change column order, and filter columns.

- Editable
  
- Determine whether the table is editable, read-only, or editable only under the conditions you specify. This property is useful for gathering user input or creating read-only tables.
  
  - Yes
    
  - Select **Yes** for components that you plan to use to collect user input.
    
  - No
    
  - Select **No** for components that you plan to be read-only.
    
  - Conditional
    
  - Configure an **IF** condition to make this component editable only under the conditions you specify. You can chain multiple **IF** conditions using `AND` or `OR`. For example, you can configure this table to be editable by a specific user only during a specific workflow stage. Configuring an **IF** condition in Workflow apps is similar to adding an [IF condition](/en/features/conditions) to a recipe workflow. Use the **Page data** modal to map data related to app users, requests, and page components into your **IF** condition.
    
- Data source
  
- This drop-down displays data tables that are already linked to your primary table and additional tables in your workspace. You can click **\+ Create table** to create a new table to display on your page. Once you select or create a table, follow the supplied link to edit table data or columns in the **Data tables** interface.
  
- Column to filter records
  
- Select a column that is linked to your primary data table to use to filter records for this table. By default, Workflow apps filters records using an auto-generated column called **{Parent table} record**. Alternatively, you can create a new column to use to filter records from the linked table.
  
- Displayed columns
  
- Choose which columns to display on your page. You can change column order by clicking a column and dragging and dropping it into a new order in the panel. You can also configure whether specific columns are **read-only** or **editable** by clicking the **...** (ellipses) next to the column name and selecting `Make column read-only` or `Make column editable`.
  
- Allow creating new record
  
- Select `Yes` to allow users to create new records when the table is editable or conditionally editable in the Workflow apps portal or `No` to prevent users from creating records.
  
- Allow deleting record
  
- Select `Yes` to allow users to delete records when the table is editable or conditionally editable in the Workflow apps portal or `No` to prevent users from deleting records.
  
- Title
  
- Provide a title for the table you plan to display.
  
- Add button label
  
- When **Editable** is **Yes** or **Conditional**, a button appears on the table which allows users to add content to the table. Provide a label for this button.
  
- Table height
  
- When **Editable** is **Yes** or **Conditional**, use this field to determine the number of rows for display in your table. When read-only, the table dynamically adjusts its maximum height based on this field's value. The default height is `10` rows.
  
- Visible
  
- This property determines the visibility of table components. The following options are available.
  
  - Always show
    
  - When set to **Always show**, table components are always visible.
    
  - Conditional
    
  - Configure an **IF** condition to make this component visible only under the conditions you specify. You can chain multiple **IF** conditions using `AND` or `OR`. For example, you can configure a table to be visible to a specific user only during a specific workflow stage. Configuring an **IF** condition in Workflow apps is similar to adding an [IF condition](/en/features/conditions) to a recipe workflow. Use the **Page data** modal to map data related to app users, requests, and page components into your **IF** condition.
    

View linked data tables action properties

Linked data tables components support [Run recipe](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/run-recipe) and [Reset/reload components](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/reset-components) actions and have the following action properties:

- Trigger
  
- Read-only. This defines the trigger for the action. `Row is active` is pre-selected.
  
- Action
  
- The action to run. The default state is `Do nothing`.
  
  - Run recipe
  - The **Run recipe** action enables you to retrieve or modify data in a third-party application and return it to your Workflow app.
- Recipe
  
- Select a recipe to run on component event. You can also create a new recipe.
  
- Recipe input parameters
  
- Define input parameters to use data from the Workflow apps page in your recipe. For example, you can use page data to search for relevant records in a third-party app.
  
- Recipe output to set value
  
- Use recipe output to set values for components and variables. Recipe output is defined in the **New component event** trigger.
  
- Follow up action
  
- You can configure a follow-up action after an initial run recipe action. If you don’t configure a follow-up action, the default follow-up action for all components is to **Do nothing**.
  
  - Reset/reload components
  - Configure a table to [reset/reload components](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/reset-components). **Reset/reload components** actions can be configured to clear the entire page or specific components, even if those components are not directly linked to a specific component action.

### Choices

Capture user input by providing users with choices. Workflow apps can save user choices in a column you specify in your Workflow app's primary data table. Saving to a column is optional and configurable based on your application's requirements.

**Page editor**

![Choices components](/assets/choice-components.60MFv1id.png)_Choices components and properties_

**Workflow apps portal**

![Choices components in the Workflow apps portal](/assets/multi-select-dropdown.j-8xsGbV.gif)_Multi-select choice component in the Workflow apps portal_

Workflow apps supports the following choice components:

- Checkbox
  
- Boolean (yes/no) selection.
  
- Single-select
  
- A selection from a predefined set of values. Workato supports the following data sources for this component: A static list of values which you enter manually, content from a specific column in your app's primary data table, and recipes.
  
  - Manual
    
  - Provide a list of options that populate the drop-down component. You can save user selection to a data column in your Workflow app's corresponding data table.
    
  - Data table
    
  - Select a data column from your Workflow app's data table to use as a data source for your drop-down component. User selection is saved to the data column. The conditions Workato uses to search for records vary depending on the number of records in your data table. For example, if your data table contains fewer than 100 records, Workato searches by the **contains** condition, which means that the search looks for records where the specified field contains the search term anywhere within its value. If your table includes more than 100 records, Workato uses the **starts with** condition. This means that the search looks for records where the specified field starts with the search term. This approach helps optimize search performance by using a more efficient search method for larger datasets while maintaining flexibility for smaller datasets.
    
  - Recipe
    
  - Use a recipe as the data source for this component. This option lets you populate the drop-down component with data from your other applications, such as Salesforce, Jira, Okta, and more.

  - Configure an **IF** condition to make this button visible only under the circumstances you specify. You can chain multiple **IF** conditions using `AND` or `OR`. For example, you can configure a button to be visible only during a specific workflow stage. Configuring an **IF** condition in apps is similar to adding an **IF condition** to a recipe workflow. Reference our [IF condition](/en/features/conditions) to learn more.
    

View button action properties

- Action
  
- This property specifies what a button does. Button actions include the following options:
  
  - Save data to a table:
    
  - Save user input as a new or updated record in the data table, which was specified when the table was created. A button with this action is required to use [public forms](/en/workflow-apps/public-links) and collect guest submissions. **_This property is available for apps with request and approval functionality only_**.
    
  - Complete task:
    
  - Completes the current task with an **Approved**, **Rejected**, or **Completed** outcome. You can optionally provide a **Custom task status** label to customize what users see when a task is **Approved**, **Rejected**, or **Completed** in the portal. For example, you can use a custom task status such as `sent for rework` to accompany a `rejected` status to communicate why the request was rejected and indicate that a revision is required. When left empty, the label is the same as the task status. See the [Complete workflow task programmatically action](/en/workflow-apps/workflow-apps-connector/complete-workflow-task-programmatically-action) for more information. Additionally, this field supports datapill input, allowing you to surface the name of the user who approved, rejected, or completed the task in the portal.
    
  - Open a webpage:
    
  - Provide a webpage URL. When clicked, this URL opens in a new browser tab.
    
  - Run recipe
    
  - The **Run recipe** action enables you to retrieve or modify data in a third-party application and return it to your Workflow app.
    
  - Reset/reload components
    
  - Configure a button to [reset/reload components](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/reset-components). **Reset/reload components** actions can be configured to clear the entire page or specific components, even if those components are not directly linked to a specific component action.
    
- Follow up action
  
- You can configure a follow-up action to [reset/reload components](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/reset-components) after an initial component action. If you don’t configure a follow-up action, the default follow-up action for all components is to **Do nothing**.

## Advanced functionality

### Custom field validation

Specific page components support custom field validation. This ensures data accuracy, prevents errors, and enhances workflow efficiency.

The following table describes which page components are compatible with each custom validation type:

| Custom validation type | Compatible components |
| --- | --- |
| Limit input length | Short answer |
| Limit input value | Number |
| Pattern matching with regex | Short answer |

Refer to our [How to prefill forms](/en/workflow-apps/prefill-forms) guide to learn more.

### Set default values in pages

Specific page components enable you to pre-configure default values using URL parameters. This enables you to pre-fill form content and is useful in scenarios where the recipients of your forms must review pre-populated information, make necessary updates, and add additional details if required.

This functionality is compatible with the following page components:

- Checkbox
- Date
- Date and time
- Decimal
- Description
- Drop-down
- Integer
- Text
