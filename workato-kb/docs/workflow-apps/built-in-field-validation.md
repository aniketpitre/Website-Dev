# Built-in field validation

Workflow apps includes built-in client-side field validation for specific page components. Built-in client-side validation ensures data accuracy, prevents errors, and enhances workflow efficiency. It guides the end-users of your apps to enter data correctly and aids compliance efforts. This ultimately enables you to create more reliable and streamlined business processes.

Workato recommends that you configure your recipes to perform additional validation in business-critical fields. Because data table entries can be edited directly in columns, they are not eligible for client-side validations.

## How it works

Workflow apps offers built-in client-side field validation for specific [page components](/en/workflow-apps/page-components). This feature enables you to ensure that users enter email addresses, phone numbers, and more in the correct format.
