> Learn how role-based access control governs who can build, manage, and configure Workflow apps and Workflow apps portal settings in Workato.

# Permissions

The ability to configure and create Workflow apps is determined by [role based access control (RBAC)](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/#how-role-based-access-control-works):

In the new permissions model, the following [project roles](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/role-based-access/new-model/system-project-roles) have full permissions to build, manage, and configure Workflow apps and Workflow apps portal settings:

- **Project admin**
- **Advanced builder**
- **Builder**

In workspaces using the legacy permissions model, the [Admin](/en/roles#role-admin) and [Analyst](/en/roles#role-analyst) system roles provide similar full access by default.

You can also assign granular Workflow apps permissions by creating a custom role in **Workspace admin > Access control > Project roles**. This allows you to separate the permissions for building and managing Workflow apps. For example, you can create a role that allows users to create Workflow apps, but prevents them from modifying Workflow apps portal settings. This guide describes the permissions necessary to perform the following tasks:

- [Create Workflow apps pages](#minimum-permissions-create-page)
- [Create Workflow apps](#minimum-permissions-create-app)
- [Configure Workflow apps](#minimum-permissions-configure)
- [Configure Workflow apps portal settings](#portal-users-manage)
- [Configure Workflow apps users and groups](#portal-users-manage)

> **DATA TABLES PERMISSIONS**
> 
> Access to Workflow apps also depends on the type of access your role has to [data tables](/en/data-tables).
