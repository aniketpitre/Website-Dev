> Configure the Workflow app interface to manage pages, add tabs, assign pages to workflow stages, and control how columns display in your app.

# Configure the app interface

The **Interface** section of the **Workflow app** tab allows you to [manage pages](#pages-manage), [add tabs](#tabs-add) for related but standalone content, and [manage how columns display](#columns-display) in your app.

If your app supports request and approval functionality, this section also enables you to [assign pages to each of your workflow stages](#pages-assign).

## Manage pages

Workato displays a preview of the pages assigned to tabs or workflow stages. You can edit pages in the [page editor](/en/workflow-apps/pages-customize) by clicking the page.

**Manage an assigned page**

### Assigned pages

Complete the following steps to manage an assigned page:

1. Go to the page you plan to manage and click **...** (ellipsis).
   
2. Manage the page, according to your requirements. The following actions are available:
   
   - Unassign page from this stage
   - Unassign page from this tab
   - Rename page
   - Clone page
   - Delete page

**Manage an unassigned page**

### Unassigned pages

Complete the following steps to manage an unassigned page:

1. Go to **Pages not shown in tabs**.
   
2. Click **...** (ellipsis) to manage the page according to your requirements. The following actions are available:
   
   - Rename page
   - Clone page
   - Delete page

## Assign pages to workflow stages

Workato automatically creates relevant workflow stages for apps with request and approval functionality. The specific stages created depend on the type of app you create. Generic apps that don't support request and approval functionality don't have workflow stages.

Workflow stages define how the request transitions through the workflow in apps with request and approval functionality. They are controlled by a recipe using the [Workflow apps by Workato connector](/en/workflow-apps/workflow-apps-connector). You can apply stages to each step of your workflow in this interface and manage workflow stage logic in recipes.

## Page assignments

All workflow stages support page assignments that determine what users see at each stage:

- **Task page**: The page that users interact with to complete their assigned task for the stage.
- **Request detail page**: A page that displays the request details. It is only visible to the originator of the request and allows them to view the original request as it moves through different stages.

For example, in an application access workflow, you might assign a submission page named `Access requests` to the **New request** stage and an approval form named `Process requests` to the **In progress Task page**. Additionally, you can assign the submission page named `Access requests` to the **In progress Request detail page** to allow it to persist through the workflow.

> **PAGES AND STAGES**
> 
> Users access one or more pages when they are assigned a task on a certain stage (assigned with a page).
> 
> In other words, if you don't plan to assign a particular workflow stage to users, it doesn't make sense to add a page to that stage.
> 
> For example, if you don't plan to use the `canceled` stage in your workflow, assigning a page to this stage serves no practical purpose.

> **NEW REQUEST STAGE**
> 
> The `New request` stage is a special pre-request stage designed to handle new requests. In the portal, this stage displays as `New`.
> 
> You cannot make changes to this stage. This stage only supports one page assignment.

Complete the following steps to assign a page to a specific workflow stage:

1. Select a stage.
   
2. Select a page type. Available options for most stages are **Task page** and **Request details page**. However, the `New request` stage only supports one page assignment.
   
   ![Assign a workflow stage to a page](/assets/stage-page-type.Cu-TIYNE.png)_Select a page type_
   
3. In the right panel, choose to **Create a page** or **Assign existing pages** to this stage.
   
   ![Assign a workflow stage to a page](/assets/workflow-stage-assign-page.ClVWcuML.png)_Assign a workflow stage to your page_
   
4. If you decide to create a new page, Workato redirects you to the [page editor](/en/workflow-apps/pages-create).
   
   If using an existing page, Workato prompts you to select the page from the list:
   
   ![Assign an existing page](/assets/page-assign.DSiq-4HN.png)_Assign an existing page_
   
5. Click **Save changes**.
   

Workato previews the page you selected in the right panel.

> **DESIGN PAGES**

6. Click **Add stage**.
   
7. Optional. Select, drag, and drop workflow stages to reorganize them.
   

You can customize existing workflow stages by modifying their name and color.

## Add tabs

You can add additional tabs to your Workflow app to include related but standalone content. These tabs can contain static information or alternate submission request forms. You can control whether tabs are visible to all users, specific user groups, or specific roles.

> **TAB NAMES**
> 
> Tab names do not support special characters, including parentheses (`()`).

Complete the following steps to add tabs to your pages:

1. Click **+** (plus) to add an additional tab to an app or workflow stage.
   
   ![Add tabs to your workflow stages](/assets/app-view-interface-tab.1Mp4JLQ0.png)_Add tabs to your workflow stages_
   
2. Enter a descriptive name for your tab.
   
3. Use the **Display tab to** drop-down menu to determine which user groups have access to this tab. The following options are available:
   
   - **All**: Display this tab to user groups with the **Member** or **Manager** role
   - **Managers**: Display this tab to user groups with the **Manager** role only

## Enable request and approval functionality

Adding a new tab to an app allows you to enable request and approval functionality for applications that don’t already support it.

Complete the following steps to enable request and approval functionality to an app:

1. Open a Workflow app.
   
2. Click **+** (plus).
   
3. Provide a descriptive **Name** for your tab.
   
4. Use the **Do you want to use this tab for workflow request process?** to select `Yes`.
   
5. Use the **Data table** drop-down to select an existing data table to store request and approval records.
   
   Alternatively, click **\+ Create data table** to create a new data table.
   
6. Use the **Display tab to** drop-down menu to determine which user groups have access to this tab. The following options are available:
   
   - **All**: Display this tab to user groups with the **Member** or **Manager** role
   - **Managers**: Display this tab to user groups with the **Manager** role only
   - **Selected user groups**: Display this tab to specific user groups
   - **Nobody**: Don't display this tab to users
7. Click **Create tab**.
   
   ![Create workflow request tab](/assets/workflow-request-tab-create.D0xN8PRw.png)_Create new tab to enable request and approval functionality_
   

You can create a submission page and recipe to receive and process requests.

## Configure request table settings

This section is available for apps with request and approval functionality and allows you to manage the app's main [data table](/en/data-tables) and to determine how the columns display in the app.

### Manage requests data table

Complete the following steps to manage the data table assigned to your request and approval app:

1. Click the assigned **Requests data table**
   
2. Use the **Data table** drop-down to select a different data table.
   
   Alternatively, click **\+ Create data table** to create a new data table.
   

### Manage displayed columns

You can configure the columns in your request data table to display to all users, only users with the manager role, or to nobody.

You can allow only users with the **Manager** role to view specific columns. For example, you may have a use case where end users upload sensitive information to the **File** [column type](/en/data-tables/user-interface/column-types). These permissions allow you to decide which users can access this information.

Complete the following steps to manage displayed columns:

1. Click **Manage displayed columns for end users**.
   
2. Determine which columns to display. The following options are available:
   
   - **Nobody**: Select this option to prevent all users from viewing this column. This is useful to hide system-generated columns from view.
   - **Manager role only**: Select this option to allow only **Managers** to view this column in your Workflow app.
   - **Everyone**: Select this option to allow all users to view this column in your Workflow app, as Workato adds all users to the **Everyone** group by default.
   
   ![Control how columns display](/assets/displayed-columns-manage.D3buaHk4.png)_Control how columns display in your Workflow app_
   
3. Optional. Drag and drop columns to reorganize them.
