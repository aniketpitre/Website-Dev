# New request trigger

The **New request** (real-time) trigger runs when there is a new request in a Workflow app.

This trigger also runs when a user creates a new record manually in a workflow app's corresponding [data table](/en/data-tables).

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Workflow app | Choose a Workflow app to check for new requests. |
| When first started this recipe should pick up events from | Get new requests since a particular date/time. Leave empty to get new requests since one hour ago. Once the recipe has been run or tested, you cannot change this value. Refer to [Triggers](/en/recipes/triggers#since-from) to learn more about this input field. |

You can also toggle **Set trigger condition** to only process trigger events matching conditions you specify.

## Output

Output is dynamic and may vary depending on the actions and triggers in your recipe, as well as the columns present in your Workflow app's corresponding [data table](/en/data-tables).

To use this data in downstream steps, map in the relevant [datapill](/en/recipes/data-pills-and-mapping#datapills) from the datatree.
