> Use the Share request action to share a request from a Workflow app with a user or user group.

# Share request action

Use the **Share request** action to share a request from a Workflow app with a user or user group. You can use this action to:

- Share the request with approvers. This enablers approvers to see the request after approval. Requests disappear from an approver's view after approval by default if you don't share the request.
- Share the request with a group of observers who need to monitor certain requests without participating in the approval workflow.
- Add participants to the request for communication purposes. Participants can leave comments and stay informed about request progress.

Users with whom you share the request have the same view as the requester. Users can see the request, access the **View details** page, and leave comments when you share a request. Sharing a request doesn't allow users to make decisions to tasks that aren't assigned to them.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Workflow app | Choose the Workflow app to share the request from. |
| Record ID | Choose a request to share with one or more additional participants. You can map in a datapill or enter the exact ID of a request. |
| Share to | Specify the user group or individual user to share the request with. You can select a user group from the list, provide a user group ID, or enter a user's email address. You can share a request with a maximum of 20 users or user groups. |

## Output

Output is dynamic and may vary depending on the actions and triggers in your recipe, as well as the columns present in your Workflow app's corresponding [data table](/en/data-tables).

To use this data in downstream steps, map in the relevant [datapill](/en/recipes/data-pills-and-mapping#datapills) from the datatree.
