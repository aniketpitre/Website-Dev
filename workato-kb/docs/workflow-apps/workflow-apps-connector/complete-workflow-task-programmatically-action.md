> Configure the Complete workflow task programmatically action to approve, reject, or complete a Workflow app task with an optional status label.

# Complete workflow task programmatically

Use this action to complete a workflow task programmatically. For example, you can use it to perform a workflow task in a different UI (including Workbot for Slack or Microsoft Teams), or to close a task that is no longer valid.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Workflow app | Select a Workflow app in which to complete a task. |
| Record ID | Choose a request (identified by its **Record ID**) to update. Use a datapill or enter the exact ID. Workato automatically generates a unique ID for each record in a Workflow app's corresponding data table. |
| Task status | Complete a task by approving, rejecting, or completing it. |
| Custom status label | _Optional_. Provide a custom task status label to customize what users see when a task is approved, rejected, or completed in the portal. For example, you can use a custom task status such as `sent for rework` to accompany a `rejected` status. This communicates clearly the reason the request was rejected and enables you to configure conditional logic to customize how your workflow handles requests assigned custom task status labels. When left empty, the label appears the same as the task status. |
| Email address | _Optional_. Provide the email address of the assignee you plan to complete the task. If this field is left empty, Workato defaults to the currently assigned user. |

## Output

Output is dynamic and may vary depending on the actions and triggers in your recipe, as well as the columns present in your Workflow app's corresponding [data table](/en/data-tables).

To use this data in downstream steps, map in the relevant [datapill](/en/recipes/data-pills-and-mapping#datapills) from the datatree.
