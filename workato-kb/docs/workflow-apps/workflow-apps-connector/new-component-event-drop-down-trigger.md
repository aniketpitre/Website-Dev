# New component event (drop-down) trigger

The **New component event (drop-down)** real-time trigger runs when a drop-down component is opened in a Workflow app. This trigger enables you to populate drop-down components with data from a third-party app. Use this trigger in combination with the **Return data to component** action to send data back to a drop-down component in a Workflow app.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Input parameters | Use input parameters to receive data from the Workflow apps page for use in your recipe. For example, you can use page data to search for relevant records in a third-party app. |
| Use recipe to find search results? | Select `Yes` and use the Search Query datapill in the recipe to enable typeahead search in drop-down components. Select `No` if the drop-down contains fewer than 1,000 options and all records can be retrieved at once. |
| Minimum search characters to trigger the recipe | Specify the minimum number of characters to trigger the recipe. The default value is `3`. Alternatively, enter `0` to trigger recipe immediately when the drop-down opens without requiring user input. |

## Output

| Output field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Context | This object contains information about the Workflow apps user accessing the page, including app-user details and group membership. |
