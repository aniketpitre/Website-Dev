# Search requests action

Search requests in a Workflow app matching criteria you specify.

## Input

| Input Field | Description |

| Workflow app | Select the Workflow app from which you plan to retrieve lists. |
| Filters | Add one or more filters to the query. All filters must contain `Column name`, `Operand`, and `Value`. All filters are chained using `AND`. |
| Column name | Available column names depend on the Workflow app you select and the columns available in its corresponding data table. |
| Operand | Available operands depend on the Workflow app and column types. Operands by data type include: Short text Equals, Is not equal to, Is null, Is not null ; Long text Equals, Is not equal to, Is null, Is not null ; Integer Equals, Is not equal to, Is less than, Is greater than, Is less or equals, Is greater or equals, Is null, Is not null ; Decimal Equals, Is not equal to, Is less than, Is greater than, Is less or equals, Is greater or equals, Is null, Is not null ; Boolean Is true, Is false, Is null, Is not null ; Date Equals, Is not equal to, Is before, Is after, Is on or before, Is on or after, Is null, Is not null ; DateTime Equals, Is not equal to, Is before, Is after, Is on or before, Is on or after, Is null, Is not null |

| Sort by | Organize search results by `Column name`. Options depend on the Workflow app and its data table. |
| Sort direction | Order search results in `Ascending` or `Descending` order. |
| Limit | Determine how many records to fetch. The default is 100 and the maximum is 200 records. |

## Output

Output is dynamic and may vary depending on the actions and triggers in your recipe, as well as the columns present in your Workflow app's corresponding [data table](/en/data-tables).

To use this data in downstream steps, map in the relevant [datapill](/en/recipes/data-pills-and-mapping#datapills) from the datatree.
