> Configure the Workflow apps connector update request action to change request fields, workflow stage, and assignee by record ID.

# Update request action

Update a request in a Workflow app. You must specify the values of all request fields you plan to update.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Workflow app | Select a Workflow app in which to update the request. |
| Record ID | Choose a request (identified by its `Record ID`) to update. Use a datapill or enter the exact ID. Workato automatically generates a unique ID for each record in a Workflow app's corresponding data table. Workato requires the Record ID to perform certain Workflow apps connector actions, including update record and delete record actions. |
| Workflow stage | Use the **Choose a value** drop-down to update the request's workflow stage to update. If left empty, the stage will remain unchanged. |
| Assignee | Use the **Choose a value** drop-down to assign the task to a user group. |
| Update request fields for the specified request | Fill in the fields for the specified request. You must fill in the fields you plan to update. Fields that are not specified are not updated. The fields that appear here depend on the request you plan to update. |

## Output

Output is dynamic and may vary depending on the actions and triggers in your recipe, as well as the columns present in your Workflow app's corresponding [data table](/en/data-tables).

To use this data in downstream steps, map in the relevant [datapill](/en/recipes/data-pills-and-mapping#datapills) from the datatree.
