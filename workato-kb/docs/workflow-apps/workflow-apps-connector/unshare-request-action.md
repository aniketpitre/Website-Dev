# Unshare request action

Use the **Unshare request** action to remove a user's or user group's access to a request in a Workflow app. This reverses access granted through the [Share request action](/en/workflow-apps/workflow-apps-connector/share-request-action).

This action succeeds even if the request wasn't shared with a user or user group. For example, if you share a request with a user who doesn't have access to the Workflow apps portal, the action succeeds, but the user isn't provisioned access to the request.

## Input

| Input field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Workflow app | Select the Workflow app that contains the request. |
| Record ID | Select the request to unshare. You can map in a datapill or enter the request ID. |
| Unshare from | Specify the user group or individual user to remove access from. You can select a user group from the list, provide a user group ID, or enter a user's email address. |

## Output

Output is dynamic and may vary depending on the actions and triggers in your recipe, as well as the columns present in your Workflow app's corresponding [data table](/en/data-tables).

To use this data in downstream steps, map in the relevant [datapill](/en/recipes/data-pills-and-mapping#datapills) from the datatree.
