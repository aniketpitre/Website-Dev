> Manage Workflow apps users and groups: invite app-users, provision with SSO JIT, and assign roles from the Workflow apps portal.

# App-user and group management

You can manage app-users and groups in **Platform > Workflow apps portal > Users and groups**.

## Add users

You have multiple options to add app-users to the **Workflow apps portal**. You can add app-users to the **Workflow apps portal** by sending individual invitations, or [SSO JIT (Just-in-time) provisioning](/en/user-accounts-and-teams/just-in-time-provisioning). The first option enables you to invite external users and requires users to accept the invitation, while SSO JIT (Just-in-time) provisioning is only for your internal users.

Your third option is to invite users programmatically using the [Invite user action](/en/workflow-apps/workflow-apps-connector/invite-user-action).

> Go to **Platform > Workflow apps portal** or use the [Usage dashboard](/en/pricing/usage) to track the number of authorized end users.

> Note that this is separate from the number of builders you can have or the apps you can create, as there are no limits on either.

A new invitation to the Workflow apps portal is sent to the user's email inbox.

## Organize users and groups

You can organize app-users into user groups. This enables you to apply permissions using [role-based access controls](/en/workflow-apps/setup-and-access#app-access-manage), and assign workflow tasks to specific groups.

By default, Workato places every user into the **Everyone group**.

### Create a group

To create additional groups:

1. Click the **+** (plus).
   
2. Name the group.
   
3. Click the **✓** (checkmark) to save.

### Add users to the group

Select **Add users to this group** to add existing users to this group.

Alternatively, you can invite new users into this group directly by clicking **Invite user**.
