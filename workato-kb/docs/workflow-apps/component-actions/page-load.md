> Configure a Run recipe action that retrieves or updates data in an external app when a page loads in the Workflow apps portal.

# Action on page load

The **Run recipe** action enables you to retrieve or modify data in a third-party application and return it to your Workflow app dynamically when a page loads in the Workflow apps portal. This allows you to sync data between external system and your Workflow app in real-time.

## Configure a Run recipe action on page load

Configuring a **Run recipe** action on page load involves the following steps:

1. [Enable action on page load](#action-enable)
2. [Configure a recipe to retrieve or modify data in an external app](#recipe-configure)
3. [Connect the recipe to page components](#output-surface)

## Enable action on page load

Complete the following steps to enable a **Recipe run** action on page load:

1. Create a new Workflow app or select an existing one.
   
2. Select the **page** and go to the **Action** panel. The action's **Trigger** event is pre-selected as `Page is loaded`.
   
3. Use the **Action** drop-down menu to select `Run recipe`.
   
4. Use the **Recipe** drop-down menu to click **Create recipe**. This opens the **Set up your recipe** page in a new tab.

## Configure a recipe to retrieve or modify data in an external app

1. Enter a unique **Name** for this recipe.
   
2. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to ensure the recipe is in the same folder as your app page.
   
3. Click **Start building**.
   
   Workato generates a recipe pre-configured with the **New component event** (real-time) trigger and the **Return data to component** action:

4. Modify the New component event trigger
   
   Complete the following steps to modify the trigger:
   
   1. Select the **New component event** trigger.
      
   2. Go to the **Setup** tab.
      
      The setup tab displays recipe input parameters and an output schema which can be used to receive data from and return data to your page.
      
      Because this recipe runs when the page loads, there isn't user input available for use in the recipe and there is no need to define input parameters.
      
   3. Go to the **Output schema** section and click **\+ Add field**.
      
   4. Define the recipe output you plan to return to your page. You must provide the **Name**, **Data type**, and **Optional** status for each output parameter. **Label** and **Hint** are optional.

5. Configure an action in an app
   
   Complete the following steps to configure one or more action in an app steps to retrieve or modify data from an external system:
   
   1. Click **Select an app and action** step in the recipe.
      
   2. Search for and select the app you plan to use. A list of available actions for the app displays.
      
   3. Select the action you plan to use.
      
   4. Select the connection type you plan to use for the component event recipe.
      
      ![Connection type](/assets/ruc-recipe.CyQNjW7-.png)_Choose a connection type_
      
      - **End user's connection**: Workflow apps recipes perform actions based on the identity and permissions of the user who connects to the application. End users authenticate with their own credentials to retrieve or modify data in an external app.
      - **This recipe's connection**: This option uses the connection established by the recipe builder and follows the same principles as normal app connections.
      
      **_Only app connections that use OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant are available for end user's connection. Refer to [Verified user access](/en/agentic/agent-studio/verified-user-access) for more information._**
      
   5. Select an existing connection or click **\+ New connection** to [create a new connection](/en/connections#create-connections).
      
   6. Configure the action based on your requirements.
      
   7. Add additional steps as required.
      
   
6. Modify the Return data to component action
   
   Complete the following steps to return recipe data to your app:
   
   1. Select the **Return data to component** action.
      
   2. Use the **Consider this action as successful?** drop-down to define whether the action completed successfully.
      
   3. Go to the output section and map in recipe data to the provided output fields. This output matches the output fields defined in the **New component event** trigger.
      
   4. Click **Save** and **Exit**.
      
   

## Connect the recipe to page components

Complete the following steps to map page data into the recipe and surface recipe output back to page components:

1. Return to the page editor and select the **page**.
   
2. Create and map a variable
   
   1. Go to the **Design** panel and select **\+ Add variable**.
      
   2. Enter the variable **Name**, **Data type**, and **Default value** as required. Variable data types must match the data type specified in the trigger output parameters. Refer to [Create a variable](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/variables#create) for more information.
      
      ![Add variable](/assets/variable-generic.DjllmcJ4.png)_Add a variable_
      
   3. Create additional variables as required.
      
   4. Select a component where you plan to display the variable, such as a **text block**, and go to the **Content** panel
      
   5. Use the **Page data** modal to map in a variable.

3. Use recipe output to set variable values
   
   1. Select the **page**.
      
   2. Go to the **Action** panel.
      
   3. Go to the **Recipe output to set value** section and click **\+ Add item**.
      
   4. Use the **Recipe output** drop-down menu to select recipe output.
      
   5. Use the **Set value for** drop-down menu to select a page component or variable to set the value for. Refer to [Populate a variable using recipe output](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/variables#populate) to for more information.
