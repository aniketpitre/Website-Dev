> Build a Workflow app that uses Run recipe actions to view, create, update, and delete CRM accounts in Salesforce.

# Example use case: CRM app

This example demonstrates how to use **Run recipe** actions to create a front-end app for a third-party application, such as a CRM, and uses Salesforce as an example.

![Front-end CRM app](/assets/crm-app.BlAOJz9_.png)_Front-end app for Salesforce powered by **Run recipe** actions_

In this example, the end-users of the application are business users who need limited access to Salesforce. This app must deliver the following functionality:

- Provide a high-level overview of accounts
- Provide a detailed look into an account users specify
- Enable users to create, update, and delete accounts

The following table describes the recipes we plan to create to accomplish these goals:

| Recipe name and action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| On page load | Surface high-level data about all accounts from Salesforce and surfaces it in the application read-only mode on page load. |
| Get data for drop-down (accounts) | Get a list of accounts from Salesforce and surface them as options in a single-select drop-down component. |
| Get account details | Get detailed information about a specific account in Salesforce and surface it in the application. |
| Create/update/delete account | Create, update, or delete an account in Salesforce, depending on user input. |
| Update an opportunity | Update an opportunity in Salesforce based on user input. |

> **EXAMPLE USE CASE**
> 
> This guide uses a sales lead processing use case and is intended to serve as an example. Recipe modifications, such as trigger, action, and conditional logic configuration, may require additional customizations to suit your specific requirements.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following to complete the instructions in this guide:

- [A Salesforce connection](/en/connectors/salesforce#how-to-connect-to-salesforce-on-workato)
- Workflow apps with the [Run recipe](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/run-recipe) and [Reset/reload components](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/reset-components) actions enabled

## Action: On page load

To collect high-level information about Salesforce accounts, you must build a recipe that retrieves data from Salesforce and configure page components to surface the data in the Workflow app.

This involves the following steps:

1. [Enable action on page load](#action-enable)
2. [Configure a recipe to fetch data from Salesforce](#recipe-configure)
3. [Surface recipe data in page components](#output-surface)

### Enable action on page load

Complete the following steps to enable action on page load:

1. Go to the page editor.
   
2. Click the page canvas.
   
3. Go to the **Action** panel.
   
4. Use the **Action** drop-down menu to select `Run recipe`.
   
5. Use the **Recipe** drop-down menu to select **Create recipe**. This opens the **Set up your recipe** page in a new tab.
   

### Configure a recipe to fetch data from Salesforce

Customizing this recipe consists of modifying the trigger, adding additional recipe steps, and modifying the **Return data to component** action.

Complete the following steps to set up your recipe:

1. Go to the **Name** field and enter `Page load` as the recipe name.
   
2. Use the **Location** drop-down menu to ensure the recipe is in the same folder as your app page.
   
3. Click **Start building**.
   
   Workato generates a recipe pre-configured with the **New component event** (real-time) trigger and the **Return data to component** action:
