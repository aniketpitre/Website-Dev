> Build a Workflow app that uses Run recipe actions and AI by Workato to translate documents into a target language.

# Example use case: Translation app

This example demonstrates how to create a simple page powered by [Run recipe](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/run-recipe) and [Reset/reload components](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/reset-components) actions and [variables](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions#variables). This app enables end-users to translate documents into any target language using [AI by Workato](/en/connectors/ai-by-workato).

> **EXAMPLE USE CASE**
> 
> This guide uses a translation use case and is intended to serve as an example. Recipe modifications, such as trigger, action, and conditional logic configuration, may require additional customizations to suit your specific requirements.

## Prerequisites

- [AI by Workato](/en/connectors/ai-by-workato)
- Workflow apps with the [Run recipe](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/run-recipe) and [Reset/reload components](/en/workflow-apps/component-actions/reset-components) actions enabled

Creating a translation app consists of the following steps:

1. [Create a new app](#app-create)
2. [Design your app](#app-design)
3. [Enable actions](#actions-enable)
4. [Configure your recipe](#recipe-configure)
5. [Surface recipe output in page components](#page-finalize)
6. [Publish your app](#app-publish)

**_You can also start with an existing Workflow app. If you have an existing app where you want to enable run recipe and reset/reload components actions, proceed to [Enable actions](#actions-enable)._**

## Create a new app

Create a new app

Complete the following steps to create a new app:

1. Go to **Platform > Workflow apps portal**.
   
2. Click **\+ New app**.
   
3. Go to the **Project name** field and provide a unique name for the project.
   
4. Go to the **App name** field and type a unique name for the application. This name is visible to the end-users of your app.
   
5. Deselect the **Submit requests** and **Review requests** options.
   
6. Click **Create project**.
   

## Design your app

Design your app

1. Go to your new app and click **Create page**.
   
2. Go to the **Page name** field and type a unique name for the page.
   
3. Modify existing page components:
   
   1. Click the text component at the top of the page and go to the properties panel to customize the app title and supporting text.
      
   2. Click the **Name** component and click the **Delete** icon to remove it from your page.
      
   3. Click the **Description** component, go to the **Properties** panel and type `Text to translate` in the **Label** field.
      
   4. Mark this component as **Required**.
      
   5. Customize the color, image, and resize the main container as necessary.
      
4. Add a component that enables app users to specify their text’s original language:
   
   1. Go to the **Page components** panel and select a **Single-select** component. Drag and drop it onto your page.
      
   2. Go to the **Component properties** panel and select **Manual** as the source and provide a list of **Options**.
      
   3. Leave this field as **Optional**.
      
   4. Go to the **Hint** field and type `Leave blank to let the app detect the original language automatically`.
      
5. Add a component that requires app users to select a target language:
   
   1. Go to the **Page components** panel and select a **Single-select** component. Drag and drop it onto your page.
      
   2. Go to the **Component properties** panel, select **Manual** as the source, and provide a list of languages as options.
      
   3. Mark this field as **Required**.
      
6. Add a component that requires app users to select an output format for the translated text:
   
   1. Go to the **Page components** panel and select a **Single-select** component. Drag and drop it onto your page.
      
   2. Go to the **Component properties** panel, select **Manual** as the source, and provide a list of options. In this example, we are providing `html`, `markdown`, and `plain text`.
      
7. Add a container to your page that will hold the translated text:
   
   1. Go to the **Page components** panel and select a container.
      
   2. Drag and drop it onto your page.
      
   3. Go to the **Page components** panel and select a text component. Drag and drop it onto your page.
      
   4. Go to the **Component properties** panel and type `Translated text` in the **Text** field.
      
   5. Go to the **Page components** panel and select a text component. Drag and drop it onto your page.
      
   6. Leave this component blank for now.
      
   7. Go to the **Page components** panel and select a button component. Drag and drop it onto your page.
      
   8. Go to the **Component properties** panel **\> Design** and type `Reset` in the **Label** field.
      
   9. Click the **Action** tab.
      
   10. Go to the **Action** menu and select **Reset components’ value**.
       
   11. Go to the **Components** field and select the component values you plan to clear, for example, **Page**.
       
   
   Your configuration should look as follows:
   
   ![Reset button configuration](/assets/translate-reset-button.BUjZbLbt.png)_Reset button configuration_
   
8. Click **Preview** to preview your app’s appearance.
   
9. Click **Save**.
   

## Enable actions

In this example, we plan to enable the following functionality for our application:

- When users click **Submit**, a recipe runs that translates their original text into the target language they specify.
- This recipe returns the translated text to the application.
- Users can click a **Reset** button to reset values for all page components, enabling them to translate a new text.

Enabling the **Run recipe** action requires working in the page editor and the recipe editor.

Complete the following steps to enable action when users click **Submit**:

1. Select the **Submit** button.
   
2. Go to the **Properties panel > Action**.
   
3. Use the **Action** drop-down menu to select **Run recipe**.
   
4. Use the **Recipe** drop-down menu to click **Create recipe**. This opens the **Set up your recipe** page in a new browser tab.
   

## Configure your recipe

Customizing this recipe consists of modifying the trigger, adding additional recipe steps, and returning data to page components.

Complete the following steps to set up your recipe:

1. Go to the **Name** field and provide a unique name for your recipe that distinguishes its purpose.
   
2. Select a location for your recipe. The recipe must be contained within the same project as your Workflow app.
   
3. Click **Start building**.
   
   Workato generates a recipe pre-configured with the **New component event** (real-time) trigger and the **Return data to component** action:
   
   ![Recipe outline](/assets/new-component-event-outline.jvzr1OeR.png)_Recipe outline_
   
4. Modify the New component or drop-down event trigger
   
   1. Select the **New component or drop-down event** trigger.
      
   2. Go to the **Setup** tab.
      
   3. Go to **Input parameters** and click **\+ Add field**.
      
   4. Go to the **Name** field and provide a unique name for this parameter.

   9. Create the following additional input parameters:
      
      | Parameter name | Label | Data type | Optional |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | source\_text | Source text | String | No |
      | output\_format | Output format | String | Yes |
      
   10. Go to **Output schema** and click **\+ Add field**. This portion of the configuration enables you to define the type of data you plan to return to your app.
       
   11. Go to the **Name** field and provide a unique name for this parameter, such as `translated_text`.
       
   12. Go to the **Label** field and provide a unique name for this parameter, such as `translated text`.
       
   13. Go to the **Data type** field and select **String**.
       
   14. Go to the **Optional** field and select `Yes` or `No`. When `No`, users must provide input for this parameter in the corresponding Workflow apps field, and this field should also be marked as required.
