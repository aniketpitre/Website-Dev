# Component design properties

Customize page components using the properties panel. The properties panel provides options that enable you to create dynamic pages that change in response to user input. You must configure each property for each component on your page.

The following table provides a high-level overview of the different types of page properties and component compatibility. Each property has a unique set of configurable fields. Additionally, the set of available properties varies for each page component.

View our [page components](/en/workflow-apps/page-components) documentation for information on customizing properties for each type of page component.
